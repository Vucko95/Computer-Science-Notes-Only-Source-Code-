A visualization tool for exploring Jini Network Technology
communities (<i>djinns</i>) with support for ServiceUI. The Service Browser
lets you discover lookup services and inspect the various
services registered within those lookup services. This tool
is provided as an example program within the Apache River release
but many who use it think
of it more as a utility than an example.

<h2>Running the Service Browser</h2>
The Service Browser is started with the following command line 
structure:
<blockquote><pre>
% java <var><b>java_options</b></var>
       -jar <var><b>install_dir</b></var>/lib/browser.jar
       <var><b>config_options</b></var>
</pre></blockquote>
where <var><b>java_options</b></var> includes such things as the security
policy file and the RMI codebase annotation, <var><b>install_dir</b></var>
is the directory where the Apache River release is installed, and
<var><b>config_options</b></var> includes any
{@link net.jini.config.Configuration} provider options. The
Service Browser can be run with no <var><b>config_options</b></var>.
For the RMI codebase annotation,
the system property <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> should be set to
two URLs that provide HTTP-based access to the Service Browser's download
JAR files,
<code><var><b>install_dir</b></var>/lib-dl/browser-dl.jar</code> and
<code><var><b>install_dir</b></var>/lib-dl/jsk-dl.jar</code>, in that order.
<p>
The Service Browser also can be run as a nonactivatable entity under the
{@linkplain com.sun.jini.start Service Starter}, using
<code>com.sun.jini.example.browser.Browser</code> for the implementation
class, <code><var><b>install_dir</b></var>/lib/browser.jar</code> for the
implementation class path, and a codebase containing URLs for
<code><var><b>install_dir</b></var>/lib-dl/browser-dl.jar</code> and
<code><var><b>install_dir</b></var>/lib-dl/jsk-dl.jar</code> (in that order).

<a name="discovering"></a>
<h2>Discovering and Selecting a Lookup Service</h2>
The lookup services that will be discovered are initially controlled
by configuration entries, with the default being to perform multicast
discovery for all lookup services. If you specify one or more groups or
addresses in a configuration file (as described in
<a href="#configuring">Configuring the Service Browser</a>),
the browser only discovers lookup services that are members of those groups
or that are at those addresses.
<p>
The Service Browser presents a single window when it is started. The
window has the menu items <b>File</b>, <b>Registrar</b>, <b>Options</b>,
<b>Services</b>, and <b>Attributes</b>. The upper text area changes to
show which groups and/or addresses are being used for discovery and
how many lookup services have been discovered.
The picture below shows a typical Service Browser main window, in which
nine lookup services have been discovered, but none have yet been selected.
<p>
<img src="doc-files/browser1.gif" 
Alt="Picture of the lookup browser as it looks when it first starts.">
<p>
As lookup services are discovered,
they appear under the <b>Registrar</b> menu, listed by unicast address.
A specific lookup service can then be selected from this menu for browsing.
When a lookup service is selected, the upper text area will be revised to
show the number of services registered in that lookup service, and the lower
folder area will show the registered services. Administrable services
are shown with a blue icon, and non-administrable services are shown with
a gray icon. As new services register or existing services unregister,
the contents of the window will change automatically to reflect them.
<p>
After initial start up, different lookup services can be discovered
using several items available from the <b>File</b> menu:
<ul>
    <li><b>Find All</b> will perform multicast discovery for all lookup
	services. This is the default behavior of the
	browser when it first starts.</li>
    <li><b>Find Public</b> will perform multicast discovery for all lookup
	services that are members of the <code>public</code> group.</li>
    <li><b>Find By Group...</b> will present a dialog box allowing you to
         specify one or more group names (separated by commas or whitespace).
	 Multicast discovery will then be performed to find all lookup
	 services that are members of those groups.</li>
    <li><b>Find By Address...</b> will present a dialog box allowing you to
	 specify one or more unicast addresses (separated by commas or
	 whitespace). Unicast discovery will then be performed to find the
	 lookup services at those adddresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, the picture below shows the dialog box presented when the
<b>Find By Group...</b> menu item is selected. 
<p>
<img src="doc-files/browser2.gif"
Alt="Picture of the lookup browser with File menu pulled down.">
<p>
In this next picture, the group name <code>examples.jini.sun.com</code>
will be entered.
<p>
<img src="doc-files/browser3.gif"
Alt="Picture of the lookup browser with group dialog box visible.">
<p>
After the group <code>examples.jini.sun.com</code> has been entered, a list of
discovered lookup services will appear in the <b>Registrar</b> menu.
In this example, only the host
<code>kahlua</code> has a lookup service running that is a member of
<code>examples.jini.sun.com</code>, so <code>kahlua</code> is the only 
address in the drop-down list from the <b>Registrar</b> menu.
<p>
<img src="doc-files/browser4.gif"
Alt="Picture of the lookup browser with drop-down registrar list visible.">
<p>
When <code>kahlua</code> is selected from the <b>Registrar</b>
menu, the window contents change as shown in the next picture.
In this example, six services are registered:
<p>
<img src="doc-files/browser5.gif"
Alt="Picture of the lookup browser with six services visible.">

<a name="inspecting"></a>
<h2>Inspecting Services</h2>
Double clicking on a service listed in the lower area of the main window
will open a new window, which can be used to inspect and optionally edit
attributes of the selected service. The window is titled <b>ServiceItem
Editor</b> if the service's administrative proxy implements any of the
administrative interfaces supported by the Service Browser, otherwise it is
titled <b>ServiceItem Browser</b>. In our running example,
double clicking on the <b>net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceRegistrar</b>
item opens this window:
<p>
<img src="doc-files/browser6.gif"
Alt="Picture of the ServiceItem editor when first opened.">
<p>
The window shows all of the attribute sets
that can be inspected and, in some cases, altered. Attribute sets and
attributes with blue icons can be edited, those with gray icons cannot.
An attribute set can be edited if it is not
{@link net.jini.lookup.entry.ServiceControlled} and the service's
administrative proxy implements the {@link net.jini.admin.JoinAdmin} interface.
Within an editable attribute set, an attribute can be edited if it is of
type <code>String</code> or one of the primitive wrapper classes.
The two attribute sets shown in the example above are <b>ServiceInfo</b>
and <b>BasicServiceType</b>.
Each of these entries can be expanded by double-clicking on them
as illustrated in the next two pictures.
<p>
Expanding the <b>BasicServiceType</b> entry:
<p>
<img src="doc-files/browser7.gif"
Alt="Picture of the ServiceItem editor with BasicServiceType expanded.">
<p>
Expanding the <b>ServiceInfo</b> entry:
<p>
<img src="doc-files/browser8.gif"
Alt="Picture of the ServiceItem editor with all items expanded.">
<p>
Double clicking again on an entry collapses the view. In an expanded entry,
double clicking on an editable attribute brings up a dialog box that
allows you to input a new value for the attribute. You can also use
the <b>Edit</b> menu in the <b>ServiceItem Editor</b> window to
add and remove attribute sets, if the service's administrative proxy
implements the {@link net.jini.admin.JoinAdmin} interface.
Select <b>Add attribute...</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu to add an 
attribute set. (Note that for this to work, you will have to run the
Service Browser in such a way that the desired attribute set classes
are in both its class path and its codebase.)
Click on an attribute set and then select <b>Remove attribute</b> from
the <b>Edit</b> menu to delete an attribute set.

<a name="filtering"></a>
<h2>Filtering Services</h2>
Back in the main window, the <b>Services</b> menu shows various types that
the registered services are instances of. You can select one or more of
these types to add them your current template to refine the set of
services displayed in the lower area of the window. When you select a
type, it appears in the upper text area to show you what your new
template contains, the revised number of matching services is shown,
and only the services that are instances of all of the selected types are
displayed in the lower area.
<p>
Similarly, the <b>Attributes</b> menu shows attribute set classes (with
package prefixes removed) that can be added to your current template to
refine the set of services.
When you select a class, it appears in the upper text area to 
show you what your new template contains, the revised number of 
matching services is shown, and only the services with such an attribute
set are displayed in the lower area. In addition, the selected menu item
changes to a  pull-aside menu.
You can go back to the <b>Attributes</b> menu to select 
additional attribute set classes, or traverse a pull-aside menu to
see the names of attributes, each of which is itself a pull-aside 
menu. You can traverse these to see the possible values for the 
attributes, and select one to further refine your search. You
can deselect existing attribute choices, and you can deselect 
the <code>(match)</code> menu item to deselect an entire class. 
<p>
By default, the <b>Services</b> menu only shows service interface types. You 
can select <b>Service classes</b> from the <b>Options</b> menu to see service
implementation classes instead. By default, only the most-derived interfaces
or classes are shown, but you can select <b>Service supertypes</b> from the
<b>Options</b> menu to see supertypes as well. Similarly, by default only the 
most-derived attribute set classes are shown in the <b>Attributes</b> 
menu, but you can select <b>Attribute supertypes</b> from the 
<b>Options</b> menu to see superclasses as well. 
<p>
Select <b>Reset</b> from the <b>File</b> menu of the main window
to reset the template to the initial (empty) state.

<a name="miscops"></a>
<h2>Other Operations</h2>
In the lower area of the main window, you can right click on a service
to obtain a popup menu. Select <b>Show Info</b> from this menu to see
details about service ID and service types. If the service's administrative
proxy implements any of the administrative interfaces supported by the Service
Browser, selecting <b>Admin Service</b> from this menu brings up the
<b>ServiceItem Editor</b> window. Selecting <b>Browse Service</b> from
this menu brings up the <b>ServiceItem Browser</b> window. If the service
is a JavaSpaces service and either its proxy implements the
{@link net.jini.space.JavaSpace05} interface or its administrative proxy
implements the {@link com.sun.jini.outrigger.JavaSpaceAdmin}
interface, selecting <b>Browse Entries</b> from this menu brings up a
window that displays all of the current entries.
<p>
In a <b>ServiceItem Editor</b> window, the <b>Admin</b> menu allows
various administrative operations to be performed on the service.
If the service's administrative proxy implements the
{@link net.jini.admin.JoinAdmin} interface,
you can use the <b>Joining groups...</b> and <b>Joining locators...</b>
menu items to control which lookup groups and lookup locators the
service uses for lookup discovery and join. 
If the service is itself a lookup service and its administrative proxy
implements the {@link net.jini.lookup.DiscoveryAdmin} interface, you can use
the <b>Member groups...</b> menu item to control 
which groups the lookup service is a member of, and you can 
use the <b>Unicast port...</b> menu item to control 
which unicast port the lookup service uses for its lookup locator. 
If the service's administrative proxy implements the
{@link com.sun.jini.admin.DestroyAdmin}
interface, you can use the <b>Destroy</b> menu item to destroy the
service. This last menu selection is illustrated in the picture below.
<p>

<a name="configuring"></a>
<h2>Configuring the Service Browser</h2>

The Service Browser obtains its configuration by calling
{@link net.jini.config.ConfigurationProvider#getInstance(String[],ClassLoader)
ConfigurationProvider.getInstance} with the <var><b>config_options</b></var>
specified on the command line and the class loader for the main
implementation class.
<p>
The Service Browser supports the following configuration
entries, with component <code>com.sun.jini.example.browser</code>:

<p>
Note that additional entries can also be specified to configure the
{@link net.jini.lease.LeaseRenewalManager},
{@link net.jini.discovery.LookupDiscovery}, and
{@link net.jini.discovery.LookupLocatorDiscovery} components. For
example, the Service Browser assumes you have configured the discovery
manager (obtained from the <code>discoveryManager</code> configuration
entry) to enforce any desired constraints for multicast discovery
and to perform any desired proxy preparation for all discovered lookup
services.
<p>
The most commonly used configuration entries are likely to be:
<ul>
<li><a href="#initialLookupGroups"><code>initialLookupGroups</code></a>
<li><a href="#initialLookupLocators"><code>initialLookupLocators</code></a>
</ul>
<p>
Secure deployments typically will provide values for most of the following
configuration entries:
<ul>
<li><a href="#loginContext"><code>loginContext</code></a>
<li><a href="#leasePreparer"><code>leasePreparer</code></a>
<li><a href="#servicePreparer"><code>servicePreparer</code></a>
<li><a href="#adminPreparer"><code>adminPreparer</code></a>
<li><a href="#listenerExporter"><code>listenerExporter</code></a>
<li><a href="#locatorConstraints"><code>locatorConstraints</code></a>
</ul>
plus the following configuration entries for <code>LookupDiscovery</code>
(if groups are used for discovery):
<ul>
<li><code>registrarPreparer</code></li>
<li><code>discoveryConstraints</code></li>
</ul>
and the following configuration entry for <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code>
(if locators are used for discovery):
<ul>
<li><code>registrarPreparer</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Loggers and Logging Levels</h2>

The Service Browser uses the {@link java.util.logging.Logger} named
<code>com.sun.jini.example.browser</code> to log
information at the following logging levels:
<p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5"
       summary="Describes logging performed by Service Browser at different
       logging levels">

<caption halign="center" valign="top"><b><code>

<tr> <th scope="col"> Level <th scope="col"> Description

<p>
See the {@link com.sun.jini.logging.LogManager} class for one way to use the
<code>HANDLED</code> logging level in standard logging configuration files.

<h2>Examples for Running the Service Browser</h2>

An example command line for starting the Service Browser is:
<blockquote><pre>
% java -Djava.security.policy=<a href="#policy">browser.policy</a>
       -Djava.rmi.server.codebase="http://<var><b>your_host</b></var>:<var><b>http_port</b></var>/browser-dl.jar http://<var><b>your_host</b></var>:<var><b>http_port</b></var>/jsk-dl.jar"
       -Djava.protocol.handler.pkgs=net.jini.url
       -jar <var><b>install_dir</b></var>/lib/browser.jar
</pre></blockquote>
In this example, the local host is assumed to have the name
<var><b>your_host</b></var>, running an HTTP server on port
<var><b>http_port</b></var>, serving files in the <code>lib</code>
subdirectory of <var><b>install_dir</b></var>, the directory where the
Apache River release is installed.
When the Service Browser is run this way, without a configuration file, it
will perform multicast discovery to find all available lookup
services, and will use Jini extensible remote invocation (Jini ERI)
over TCP/IP for its remote event listeners.
<p>
An example command line for starting the Service Browser with a
configuration file is:
<blockquote><pre>
% java -Djava.security.policy=<a href="#policy">browser.policy</a>
       -Djava.rmi.server.codebase="http://<var><b>your_host</b></var>:<var><b>http_port</b></var>/browser-dl.jar http://<var><b>your_host</b></var>:<var><b>http_port</b></var>/jsk-dl.jar"
       -Djava.protocol.handler.pkgs=net.jini.url
       -jar <var><b>install_dir</b></var>/lib/browser.jar
       <a href="#public">public.config</a>
</pre></blockquote>
The example configuration file <code>public.config</code> only discovers
lookup services in the public group:
<a name="public"></a>
<blockquote><pre>
com.sun.jini.example.browser {
    initialLookupGroups = new String[]{""};
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The following example configuration file initially discovers no
lookup services and uses JRMP for its remote event listeners:
<blockquote><pre>
com.sun.jini.example.browser {
    initialLookupGroups = new String[]{};
    listenerExporter = new net.jini.jrmp.JrmpExporter();
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In all the above command lines, the policy file <code>browser.policy</code>
was specified for the <code>java.security.policy</code> system property.
An example policy file is:
<a name="policy"></a>
<blockquote><pre>
grant codebase "file:<var><b>install_dir</b></var>/lib/browser.jar" {
    permission java.security.AllPermission;
};

grant codebase "file:<var><b>install_dir</b></var>/lib/jsk-platform.jar" {
    permission java.security.AllPermission;
};

grant codebase "file:<var><b>install_dir</b></var>/lib/jsk-lib.jar" {
    permission java.security.AllPermission;
};

grant {
    permission java.net.SocketPermission "*:1024-", "connect";
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Of course, a more restrictive policy file could be used;
the one shown here is for illustrative purposes only.
<p>
An example of running under the Service Starter is:
<blockquote><pre>
% java -Djava.security.policy=<a href="#start_policy">start.policy</a>
       -Djava.protocol.handler.pkgs=net.jini.url
       -jar <var><b>install_dir</b></var>/lib/start.jar
       <a href="#start_config">start.config</a>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
where <code>start.config</code> is the following configuration file:
<a name="start_config"></a>
<blockquote><pre>
import com.sun.jini.start.NonActivatableServiceDescriptor;
import com.sun.jini.start.ServiceDescriptor;

com.sun.jini.start {

  serviceDescriptors = new ServiceDescriptor[]{
    new NonActivatableServiceDescriptor(
      "http://<var><b>your_host</b></var>:<var><b>http_port</b></var>/browser-dl.jar http://<var><b>your_host</b></var>:<var><b>http_port</b></var>/jsk-dl.jar",
      "<a href="#policy">browser.policy</a>",
      "<var><b>install_dir</b></var>/lib/browser.jar",
      "com.sun.jini.example.browser.Browser",
      new String[]{"<a href="#public">public.config</a>"})
    };
}
</pre></blockquote>
An example policy file for <code>start.policy</code> is:
<a name="start_policy"></a>
<blockquote><pre>
grant codebase "file:<var><b>install_dir</b></var>/lib/start.jar" {
    permission java.security.AllPermission;
};

grant codebase "file:<var><b>install_dir</b></var>/lib/jsk-platform.jar" {
    permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
</pre></blockquote>
