Data Format Summary 

  Specifically: 
  * rt-polarity.pos contains 5331 positive snippets
  * rt-polarity.neg contains 5331 negative snippets

  Each line in these two files corresponds to a single snippet (usually
  containing roughly one single sentence); all snippets are down-cased.  
  The snippets were labeled automatically, as described below (see 
  section "Label Decision").

Label Decision 

We assumed snippets (from Rotten Tomatoes webpages) for reviews marked with 
``fresh'' are positive, and those for reviews marked with ``rotten'' are
negative.
