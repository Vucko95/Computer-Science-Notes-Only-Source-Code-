       Man...Leo pointed out how I have begun nearly all of my blogs with "I'm so tired" ~ He said that I should go get some rest and I couldn't agree more, but I can't.  I don't have the time!!  And it's my fault that I don't have the time.  I can hardly wait.  Two more weeks and then, I'll be back in Chicago.  Chi-town ~ home sweet home...man, I get tears in my eyes.  I guess that I'm just a sappy emotional person.  I cry when I tell my mother and father that I love them.  I sniffle when I tell my siblings that I love them.  I get tears in my eyes when I look at pix of me and my p.sisters.  *^_^*  They make me smile and cry at the same time.  I'm telling you, in May, I'm going to be bawling once it happens.  We've been through so much together, babes.  No eye makeup for me that night because it's all gonna smear!!  I'm totally looking forward to tonight and volunteering tomorrow at the Special Olympics.  I'm getting tears in my eyes right now just typing this.  Other than everything else...the situation with my grandparents just isn't getting much better.  They never change and maybe, it is because they're old-fashioned and traditional, but it's not really fair to me that they're still judging me based on my gender and how I'm just automatically wrong.  It's not fair but I'm not one to judge them or anyone else for that matter.  That's the Lord's job and He will punish and He will uphold those in His Name.  *sigh*  Just thinking about how great He is makes me smile.

       I'm so tired.  I'm still tired.  And I'm stupid.  I'm stupid because I overworked my body.  I've pushed my body to a point where it's just giving up right now.  The whole day has been revolving around my two papers.  I turned in the first one and that seemed to be okay..I haven't touched Vivarin in the longest time just because I didn't want to end up addicted to them as I was in junior high.  All of yesterday and the day before, I was just surviving off of pure necessity that I had to stay awake.  It was imperative for me to finish off my papers.  Anyway, so the whole day passed until 4pm and I was just rush rush rush..all panicky.  I stopped for a good half an hour to sit there and pray.  I prayed and I prayed for those close to me.  I prayed for enlightenment.  I prayed for strength.  And I praised God for being alive.  I praised him for allowing me to feel things.  I praised for allowing me to cry when I needed to cry.  And I prayed for His guidance.  I was working on my second paper when my body just gave up and I fell asleep and missed turning it in.  *fudge*  I realized that 72 hours of no sleep is a bad thing.  *sigh*  So, I'm just kinda screwed over right now.  I'm so tired..two more weeks and then, I'm going to be on my way to Chicago.  Home sweet home!  Anyway...I'm going to go study some and go to bed soon since I do have work super early tomorrow..

       They finally caught up to me.  D*mn it.  I've been busy deleting crap messages from my grandparents.  I'm so sick of their incessant degrading words.  It's the same ones over and over again ~ 'your mother should have aborted you when she had the chance', 'they should have just given you up for adoption because having a failure to our family name wasn't worth it', 'why don't you ever think about doing something good with your career?', 'why are you an english major?  that's being a traitor', 'you're not chinese.  you're not taiwanese.  you're the spawn of the devil.', 'you have been nothing but disaster and doom to your family.  we could see it the moment that you were conceived.', 'you are nothing but a female.  you might as well kill yourself now.'  I had to sit through ten minutes of that before I just hung up on them.  I didn't want to hear anymore.  Besides, I was biking to work and I was there already.  For the past four days, I've been dealing with emails and voicemails of that crap.  Actually hearing them speak to me and say all those things all over again and rephrased, you know what it made me feel?  It made me begin blaming myself.  I mean, I already had a rough enough morning struggling with my papers and then, with a voicemail from them at friggin' 6:30am.  I guess that I really wanted some comfort.  I have been wrong and I blame myself for this.  I didn't share this problem with Duy because I didn't want to bother him.  It's just another one of my problems that I should deal with.  He's been going through a rough time and he's been really busy and tired.  I was stupid and I called him up after I heard the voicemail from my grandparents and I woke him up.  I was an inconsiderate b*tch as Duy constantly reminds me as I act or say things without fully thinking them through.  I don't know.  I just wanted to hear a little comfort.  I just wanted to smile again.  Even if it was a false smile, I just wanted to smile again.  Instead, I'm crying again.  I hate myself for crying.  I hate myself for being weak.  I guess what bothers me the most is when Duy starts to scold me, I usually don't defend myself because I no longer see a purpose in defending myself.  What hurt so much is this time, I never got a chance to explain myself.  I think about it now.  Okay, so my situation wasn't an emergency.  But I was hurting.  And I guess that isn't reason enough to call up my boyfriend to turn to him.  I don't know.  I need to purge myself of these thoughts so I can get back to my ten pages leftover to write in the next hour and half...

       I'm so tired.  I'm so out of it.  I'm so close to tears right now.  I have work at 8am.  I have classes from 9:30-10:45,11-12:15,2-3:15, and 3:30-4:45pm today.  I have two last papers due today.  Both are worth a huge portion of my grade.  I'm so nervous about it right now.  I'm feeling so terrible right now.  I'm going on my third night of no sleep.  I can't think straight anymore.  I'm so exhausted.  Did I already say that?  I don't remember anymore.  Last night...actually, this morning, I was just writing plain gibberish.  How terrible was that?  My girls, I needed you last night.  Seriously, I love all of you p.s.  P.s. Mey, once again, Happy 20th Birthday.  Words fail to express how happy I am for you that you found someone that can treat you right.  If anyone deserves that, it's you.  You had a wonderful birthday and it was wonderful to see you beam like that.  I'm glad that you were able to share your special day with us...or at least, end it.  It was a little break that we all needed.  I needed that little time with all of my p.s. to get through this rough point in life, especially between my papers.  I want to tell all of you p.s. how stressed I'm feeling about my papers.  How right now, I'm trusting blindly in God.  God, it's like the analogy of skydiving.  I'm so scared and don't know what to expect because I don't know the truth.  I go up in the plane and I trust that my parachute will open up and bring me safely down to the ground.  I tiptoe to the edge of the door of the plane, just as I tiptoe over to the edge of my comfort zone.  I look down and I can barely make out anything. I can barely see the ground.  I don't know where I'm going to land.  I don't know how I'm going to end up.  I just have to trust and believe.  But right now, I'm a wuss.  I can't jump yet.  I'm too scared to jump.  Lord Father, give me the strength to pull through.  Please help to trust you.  Please help me to find the strength from deep within.  I'm so scared right now.  I cannot begin to fathom the depths of my fears.  I fear school and my future.  Is graduate school the way for me?  I graduate next spring.  I've been pushing myself to graduate in three years and attempt to receive my masters in my fourth year.  I'm not smart like Grace or Steve.  I'm just an average student who struggles with her grades and studies to reach my level.  I was just given a second chance here at UCSB and I can't let that chance slip past my fingertips and slither down the drain.  If I am headed towards graduate school, I need to study for my exams.  When will I find the time for it?  I know, I know, time management.  Not getting the RC position brought about many other concerns of mine.  That means that I cannot quit my jobs.  I just hope that I can pay off my medical bills.  That is my largest concern.  My paternal grandparents are in town.  Lord Father, I ask you to please soften my heart.  I loved my maternal grandparents dearly and cancer slowly took them away...my grandmother in 8th grade and my grandfather in my senior year of high school.  I ask of you, Christ, to soften my heart and attempt to be nice to them.  I can be polite but dear sweet Jesus, I still hold rancor towards them.  It no longer makes me cry knowing that they never wanted me and still do not like me at all because I am a female.  I was doomed as being born a female.  But all of their sexism has made me stronger as a person.  On a sidetrack, as strong as I try to be, I turn to you for a shoulder to lean on..and every now and then, I need to break down.  But why is it that lately, I've been breaking down more than ever.  I try to hold as much as I can inside.  I try to be as strong as I can on the outside when on the inside, I'm ready to fall.  I shouldn't feel this way.  I shouldn't think like this.  It is not right.  I'm just so tired.  I guess that I don't know what I say or do anymore....

       Man...I'm so lame.  I typed out this huge thing and then accidently deleted it.  *bleah*  Anyway, first and foremost: "When I find myself fading, I close my eyes and realize my friends are my energy." to my sisters, things are hard, but with you by my side, I can go on and we can face ANYTHING together..just stick together..nek��y�l� Rocky - ch�z�b� *^_^* for the shake and for being a buddy..heehee..hey, once you cross, can you adopt me as your lil' sis?  and ba.an hay qua' john, C�m on anh!!  Okay, other than that.  Why am I lame?  I'm a silly ole' girl, too.  This morning, since I really didn't sleep, I was working on my paper, I brought my keyboard up so I could rest my elbows and then, next thing you know, I fell asleep at the keyboard and *sigh*  I woke up an hour later with the indentation of the keyboard on my forehead and face with about 32 pages of random gibberish from my face.  *ugh*  Okay, about Sunday and back to my frustration.  Well, after church, I spent the rest of my afternoon just staying at home and working on my papers and studying and doing homework.  Just being a good lil' girl.  Oh, yeah, ch�z�b� Rocky again for being a buddy.  Anyway, my boyfriend called me and I was pretty happy to hear his voice.  Anyway, we were teasing and kidding around about stuff.  He teased me and asked 'What happened to the sweet innocent girl that I first started dating'  In retort, I accidently said 'So, what happened to the sweet romantic guy that I first fell in love with?'...bad idea.  He got pretty mad about the whole thing.  So, we got into a 'fight' but I don't know if you could really call it a fight.  So, I provoked him, but I wasn't fighting back.  Alot of the things that he said hurt my feelings.  So, with each word of anger that he said, a tear rolled down my face and I was choking back sobs because I didn't want him to hear me cry..  I don't really want to repeat the things that he said.  Basically, he hung up on me.  My first instinct was to call one of my friends and try to resort out my feelings, but I stopped.  This problem was between my boyfriend and me.  Not my friend and me.  So, I picked up the phone and tried to talk to him, but he said that he didn't want to talk and then, hung up on me.  I was so frustrated and sobs were just dying to burst out of me.  So, I threw on my blue windbreaker jacket and exchanged my boxers for my blue running shorts and just ran out the door without even saying bye to my apartmentmate.  *sigh*  I was just sobbing and crying and running like a mad woman.  I ran all the way out to the pier.  I ended up sprinting down the pier in the pouring rain completely soaked to the bone.  What did I realize while I was out there...  I've been doing some thinking and I owe him a major apology.  I realized something today.  I love him.  But besides that, I love him for who he is.  I shouldn't have said all that stuff about him not being romantic anymore, because that's not why I fell in love with him.  If anything, he's just human and I fell in love for all those human qualities, and faults, too.  I fell in love with him for who he is ~ stubborn, independent, pretty boy, yet at the same time, caring and simply wonderful.  Guys are lame.  Hear me out why.  Guys are romantic and sweet when they're pursuing a girl, but once they get the girl, they begin to take her for granted.  They stop being romantic and sweet and their excuse is that there is no need to do such things.  They spoil a girl and then, expect her to still be happy with just the guy.  They go back to being lazy and they expect the girl to be happy with him when he's hasn't really changed but gone back to being his normal self.  He's comfortable enough with her to show her the real him.  And I realized something..I am stupid.  I love my boyfriend for who he is and I cannot seem to stress that enough.  All that extra romantic stuff..that was sweet.  But that's not why I fell in love with him.  Anyone can do that stuff but nobody can be my Duy Ba Dinh, my honey, ~ the man that I love.  *^_^*  I know how corny this is beginning to sound, but...I don't care.  I have spent more dates with him at a computer show and have had more fun than dinner and a movie with him..no offense or anything meant, hon.  But at the same time, there is so much going on and all I ask for is his blind trust and I know that's a difficult thing to ask for, especially long distance..but I know that we can work out..I just need him to try...  I was still very upset and crying as I was running in the pouring rain and I saw this car coming towards me and I jumped out of its way, but I guess that I didn't fully get out of its way.  The side mirror hit me and I went stumbling forward.  I thought that I had regained my balance but instead, my foot tripped over the speedbump and I was a mess.  I limped over to my closest friend's place and Pat said that I showed up with blood on my hands and leg and sock and shoe and snot and tears all over my face.  Icky, huh?  Anyway, he didn't have any band-aids so I ended up going to the hockey game so I could clean up myself.  I'm glad that I went.  My hockey boys cheered me up and I was proud of their win ~ so proud that I baked them all cookies..heehee..  But yeah, my boys are great..heehee..congrats Pat, Son, Rocky, Randy, and Dinh!!  The game was so great.  Randy was totally on fire and Pat had some pretty awesome saves.  Son scored!!  *^_^*  this time, he scored for our team =o�  And Rocky aka the old man did pretty well besides being all pooped out..it's okay, old man.  *^_^*  ANyway, despite my frustrations, my friends aka my sisters or my hockey boys help me feel better.  So, now, I have a bad cough and kinda sick from running the rain and my knee aches sooo badly and I have an ankle brace on...my lesson?  I need to find a new safer method of releasing my frustrations.  *sigh*

        I don't even know where to begin about the weekend.  I guess that we could start about Saturday...that's when things started to happen.  Well, that's a lie in itself.  I'm sorry for being so contradictory.  Things started getting frustrating at a different point but for this weekend, it was Saturday.  Saturday, I spent most of the afternoon just doing homework and working on my papers.  Anyway, my boyfriend mentions that he's thinking about coming to Santa Barbara to come and visit me since I told him yesterday that I wasn't going to do anything on Saturday or Sunday - just chill and relax and study.  But plans had been changed and I was going to spend some time with my sisters Saturday night.  He pretty much wasn't very happy about that.  What confuses me is that he would have arrived here at 11:30pm and I would have been back at home at midnight.  So, he could have waited a mere half an hour but he said that it would be a waste of his time.  Anyway, I get home around midnight and check my computer.  His away message worried me for a moment there and I tried calling him and left frantic messages trying to figure out where he is.  His away message didn't sound good.  Anyway, I'm up in my living room all by myself and it's raining ickily outside studying, missing him and praying that he'll be okay.  Finally he calls and he's out clubbing with some girls.  At first, I was just relieved and then, a part of me just kinda sank because he said that he didn't want to be up that late since he was sick.  I figure that I'd shrug it off and ignore it.  I was wrong.  He ended the conversation saying something that hurt my feelings.  That was it.  I took off running and it was drizzling around 2am.  I ran and ran and ran for about an hour.  Finally, I got so tired that I stopped on the sidewalk to stretch out.  I was so tired since I didn't get too much sleep the night before and the day before that, I had work at 5:30am and had stayed up until 2am to help my boyfriend finish up his paper.  I laid my arms out in front of me and laid my head down and closed my eyes briefly.  About three hours later, I awoke in pouring rain and I was completely drenched.  I was so wet and cold that I ran home and showered and changed.  I think that I got a little sick from that..anyway, I went home and took a long hot shower.  After that, I decided to call my boyfriend to see if he was awake for the computer show yet.  He ended up yelling at me for waking him up which hurt my feelings.  An hour after I get off the phone and cry myself to sleep, he calls and wakes me up.  I roll out of bed and go to church.  Once again, I spent the rest of my day writing papers and that night...well, I'll save that story for tomorrow when I have the time.  ...time to go back to paper #5 for this week...

       I'm so tired and frustrated.  Frustrated about what?  I don't know anymore.  Well, actually, I do.  I guess that I'm just in denial over the whole thing.  I want to believe that everything will turn out okay.  I guess that I should go down the list.  School.  Gosh, I don't know anymore.  Finals are upcoming and I should be worried.  I guess that I'm just so braindead from all these papers.  I turned in two yesterday and two today and I have two more due on Thursday.  Crazy, huh?  Sometimes, being an English major just isn't fun at all.  *bleah*  I'm doing okay in school.  I know that I can do better but this quarter isn't just only hard but I'm so tired.  I'm tired from working so much.  Work.  Another tiring task.  I don't know anymore.  Honestly, I like working.  I enjoy working, but I guess that I have come to a point in my life when I just want to stop working and just concentrate on school and concentrate on other things.  I'm very worried about my standardized tests for graduate school.  I graduate in a year and I need to take those darned tests.  I just don't know anymore.  Just so tired.  What else?  Fellowship and Christ.  My walk with Christ is improving as time goes on, especially lately with all the tragedies taking place and especially with my sisters there by my side to pull me thorugh everything and to help me out.  They have been a tremendous amount of support to me.  My sisters.  They are so wonderful.  I know that things aren't easy but with them there, I know that we can do anything as long as we are together.  I know that I cannot say much but not that much needs to be said.  Through thick and thin, we'll make it through!!  My family.  When am I not worried about them?  I guess that if anything, I just feel worse because I cannot be there for them, especially my siblings...  but the frustrating thing right now?  Gosh, I want to talk about it..but not right now...the timing isn't right yet...I'll tell you about this weekend another day...

       random thought:  "in wanting to make others like us, we may be making it impossible for them to love us,"  Paradoxically, we fail to disclose ourselves to other people because we want so much to be loved.  Because we feel that way, we present ourselves as someone we think can be loved and accepted and we conceal whatever would mar that image.  What matters is that we should be able to be private when we wish, when thats meaningful, and to be quite open and transparent when thats appropriate.  Another reason disclosure is so important is that without it we really cannot know ourselves.  We learn to decieve ourselves while we are trying to deceive others.  self disclosure comes too from a grace that i can only call flexibility, we need to abandon our fears that the other person will grow away from us or leave us and replace these fears with a genuine concern for growth and happiness

       What a day today has been.  I feel good as though I have accomplished alot.  When in reality, there is still much to be done.  I guess that when I woke up this morning and had more than my usual amount of quiet time in reflecting over the Bible and after reading the Bible, I was stretching out and I had this feeling inside of me that everything was going to be okay.  Throughout everything, the one constant thing in my life has been the steady growth of my faith.  Christ has been amazing to me.  No matter what has happened, He has been there by my side.  I worked six hours today and went to four hours of classes.  In addition to that, I found enough time to run errands and relax a little bit.  I even took a little nap.  *^_^*  heehee..and now, I'm getting ready to head on out to study/work.  Does that make sense?  I get paid $12.75 an hour to sit there and eat free food and drinks and study?  It's okay..it's one of my jobs.  =o�  Anyway, I'll be with my sisters and nothing else could be better.  They're so wonderful.  I know that I cannot talk too much about them but what can I say?  Words fail to describe the entity of the euphoria that they have brought to me.  Actually, it's not completely euphoric because there is no such thing as perfect except in Christ.  What my sisters represent to me is this amazing timeless friendship.  And all friendships go through their ups and downs but it is those pitfalls that make a friendship stronger and through our mistakes, we all learn.  awww...I miss you all!!  And to all those other sisters who are supporting us, I thank you for everything and I thank you for giving us a chance and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity like this.  *^_^*  heheee..okay, time to go to work and see my sisters!!  PS: babe, Happy Official Five Months!

       *fudge*  I tried to go to work today.  I worked for about three hours at one job before they sent me home.  I felt really icky but I still got my act together and studied and got ready for my other job.  I went to my other job and worked for about 2.5 hours before I got sent home from there.  *bleah*  My cough has worsened into some sort of flu.  I ended up taking my temperature and had a fever of 101 degrees.  To add onto that, I started throwing up.  I had coffee for breakfast and that came out..all nasty watery vomit. Ewww...and then, I tried drinking some soup for lunch but it all came out, too.  Figured that I needed some Vitamin C, so I had an orange, but that came up within minutes.  UGH!  I spent the rest of my afternoon trying to read and write my paper.  Thank you, Big Sister Marcelle for calling me and talking with me.  I needed that smile!  *^_^*  Other than that, I've been feeling really icky poo.  *bleah*  HAPPY 20th Birthday p.sister Donna!!  I still love my sisters through thick and thin...*hugz*

       My day started off pretty well, but my cough got much worse.  I hate to admit it but it was prolly my early morning run.  You know what I just realized.  Way back in the day, I think that I picked up the phrase 'prolly' from Kent and it just kinda stuck.  And now, I think about it.  Some of the other slang that I use is been rubbed onto me from others, as well.  I wonder if anyone starts saying 'pop' instead of 'soda'?  *^_^*  Heehee..anyway, I'm feeling mixed right now.  I have a bunch of things going through my head and none of them have anything to do with my 20 page paper.  By the way, I reread what I wrote last week and it makes no sense whatsoever, so I decided to give up and rewrite the whole thing.  I trashed the old paper and began anew.  I already have eleven pages which isn't bad for a day and half.  But still..I'm going to be pretty tired.  I think that I need sleep before I work on my paper.  So much is going on.  I want to quit work so I can concentrate on school.  I want to study for my grad school exams right now and take them.  I want to concentrate on one thing at a time.  Don't worry..I'm just whining right now.  Just feeling overwhelmed from work.  And frustrated because of them.  One job ~ I have to come back during my spring break to work for them because they're already not too happy about me taking off a few days to go to Chicago.  Man..they already made me stay here during winter break anyway.  Sheesh..the other job?  They're requesting me to work 30 hours during my finals week.  I miss Carrillo so much.  I felt much more appreciated there and they didn't force us to work more hours.  And THEY called me.  I was in the middle of coughing my heart out when they called me.  They heard me coughing, instead of asking if I was okay or something considerate, their exact wording was 'Hope that you die soon.'  That caught me off guard and made me want to cry.  I know that I've built myself up to be strong against them, but I'm feeling so weak right now and they just have to beat up on me further when I'm weak.  What did I do so wrong that makes them hate me?  I don't know, and their only excuse is that I was born a female.  I was born into my family.  My very existence is their problem.  They have nothing better to do except berate me...they make me feel so bad about myself...=o(

What did I do so wrong that makes them hate me?  I don't know, and their only excuse is that I was born a female.  I was born into my family.  My very existence is their problem.  They have nothing better to do except berate me...they make me feel so bad about myself...=o(

       *stretch*  I just got out of the shower after a good run.  Thanx again, Rocky, for running with me so late/early?  I dunno...not many ppl would go running with me at 4:45am.  *^_^*  Anyway, hope that you're sleeping well.  To my Big Sis, *hugz*  Thanx sooo much for the care package.  I can hardly wait to go to Santa Cruz to hang out with you!!  Good luck on finals and enjoy your spring break.  I feel so loved right now.  I came back to emails from my p.sisters and aww...I love you guys, too.  You're all so wonderful!  To add onto that, on my way home, I also went to go get the mail.  Dave, thank you for the letter.  It made me special and loved, too. *^_^*  Thank you everyone for putting a smile back on my face.  I feel that I am starting this week alot better than last week.  As for now, I'm not that tired but I figure that I'll go read or something until I zonk out.  I still have to wake up though for church and do my homework and if I'm not mistaken.  I believe that there is a supervisor meeting later today.  *sigh*  I have to work on my paper, too...and there's a meeting tonight.  I can hardly wait to see my sisters again!  *smilez*

       My darling sisters, thank you for being there for me.  Words fail to express the immense gratitude and love that I feel for all of you.  I'm just so tired right now and fighting off any chance of sickness.  As usual, I'm proud of us and how far we've gotten so far.  I know that this is just the beginning, but we've come a long way.  After spending so much time together, I adore each one of us more and more.  I thank you for making me smile and for making me feel better.  These past two days, we've all spent so much time together.  I'm sorry that we didn't get a chance to serve today...it's okay though.  We have other chances and I know that everything will be okay.  It's already dead week and finals loom at the end of the week.  I dread those finals.  At least, I have Chicago to look forward to and then, I'll be back in SB to work during my spring break, but at the end of it all, I'm going up to Santa Cruz.  *^_^*  My only thing is that I'm going to miss my sisters soo much when we all go on our separate paths for Spring Break.  I guess that another reason why I'm so tired is that I went to the doctor's.  Something happened and I kinda wanted it checked out.  I don't know why I went when I think that I knew what had already happened.  The emptiness inside of me is the same as before and that hollow sinking feeling was present.  I took some tests and the doctor gave me three possibilities but I think that I already know the answer.  They will know for sure as time passes, but I know already..kinda sucky though having that feeling.  *bleah*  I guess that's another reason why I'm so exhausted.  There is alot going on right now, but I'm trusting everything into the Lord's hands.  I am taking life one stride at a time and I close my eyes blindly to take your hand to allow you to guide me on this journey of life.  You have a plan for me and everything happens for a reason.  I know that despite whatever problems I am facing, I will prevail and I will grow stronger in my faith in you and stronger as a person.  He is so amazing and great!  *^_^*

       EEEK!!  Well, I finished up with all of my finals.  *whew*  But what am I eeking about?  Friggin' a...I went running late last night (around 1ish in the morning) and I friggin' didn't come home until 7am.  *bleah*  I went running hecka far and I did it again.  I fell asleep out in the cold.  So much for my 'I'm going to get such a good sleep tonight since I'm finally done with finals'  Ugh, anyway...ChIcAGO.  I leave today.  I leave in a couple of hours for LA.  Anyway, I know that my layout is atrocious and every time I go to fix it, it just gets worse.  I'll do something about it eventually.  *bleah*  I'm just very bleahy today.  I'm trying to figure out what to do to make my mood a little bit better.  I still have to do my chore for the week which is wiping down the counters, cleaning the stove and kitchen, tidying up the living room, and watering the plants.  Figure that I'll clean first and then, finish up with my packing.  *sigh*  Chicago..the thought will cheer me up.  *^_^*

       Hmm..where should I begin?  Know love. Know happiness. No love. No happiness.  What can I say?  My dearest ladies, I am very happy for you..ps Jenn and ps Steenie and ps Mey(tco)...  I smile for you sisters.  You deserve the best and I am so happy to see you happy.  Hang in there..to all my buddies, best of luck on finals (and if you're already done or don't have finals, don't tell me..I still got five of them to take...got that?  Five of them) *hugz*  Anyway, other than that...If you never make mistakes or your heart never breaks, then you�ll never know what true love takes.  And sometimes, ignorance is bliss.  Have you ever noticed that the worst way to miss someone is when they are right beside you and yet you can never have them... when the moment you can't feel them under your fingertips you miss them?  Have you ever wondered which hurts the most... saying something and wishing you had not, or saying nothing and wishing you had?  I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say...  They are the things you get ashamed of because words diminish them; words shrink things that seemed timeless when they were in your head... to no more than living size when they are brought out...  Don't be afraid to tell someone you love him.  If you do, he might break your heart... but if you don't, you might break his.  Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person?  Your heart decides who it likes and who it doesn't.  You can't tell your heart what to do.  It does it on its own when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.  Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?  Too many of us stay closed up because we are too afraid to care too much for the fear that the other person does not care as much, or at all.  Have you ever loved someone and they had absolutely no idea whatsoever?  Or fell for your best friend in the entire world, and then sat around and watch them fall for someone else?  Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?  We tell lies when we are afraid...afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us.  But every time we tell a lie... the things we fear grows stronger Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump Don't be a person who has to look back & wonder what they would have or could have had.  No one waits forever..  Sometimes, I've realized that once you have loved someone, you can do anything for them.  Except love them the same way.  When do you begin to realize that it's time to stop fighting for what you believe in?  Do you ever stop fighting for what you want?  Or do you take a step back and realize that you're being selfish?  And maybe what you want isn't what the other person wants.  Maybe that other person wants to be let go of.  That other person wants you to stop fighting and you realize that you're just fighting the truth..you're fighting yourself.  Is that worth it?  What is worth it now?  I thought that I once knew.  But now?  I know that you cannot take anything for granted.  Nothing is for sure.  Nothing is definite.  The only true thing in this world is the Lord and that's it.  Just Him.  I miss my family and with everything going on, I wish that I could be there for them.  I miss Duy and I wish that I could be there for him, too.  I miss my friends back home and I wish that I could be there for them.  I miss my friends here and I wish that I could be there for them.  I wish for so much and I try but I've learned that I can only do so much.  And sometimes..you have to stop fighting and just give in.  Sometimes, you have to sacrifice in order to really realize what you had...

       Right now, I'm trying as hard as I can to focus on the important things in life: the things that are happening right now.  I'm trying to plan for this summer, but it's hard to.  Right now, I'm torn between staying here at UCSB or going to UCI for summer school.  It's a big decision and I cannot seem to make up my mind.  I guess that I should list the options for each one.  Living-wise: UCSB ~ I'd be an RC (Resident Coordinator) for the single student apartments which means that I have a 1bdrm apartment fully to myself, all utilities, phone, cable, everything paid for plus a $160/month stipend; UCI ~ I'd be living with my best friend, Cathy *^_^*  School-wise: UCSB ~ offering a deal of all units over 8 units are free!!!  Dude, I'm taking 15 units and only having to pay for 8 of them?  That's pretty tight...plus in addition to that, UCSB could possibly give me financial aid for those 8 units and oh, yeah, no registration fee at all since I'm already a Gaucho...  UCI ~ I'll be paying for the full 15 units and everything but at the same time, I can take Chinese with a friend plus that means that Duy and I can take that digital arts class together and we can also take ballroom dancing, too...  Work-wise: UCSB ~ found an internship for my minor in Professional Writing; UCI ~ I can do substitute teaching in Orange County  Social-wise: UCSB ~ all of my sisters won't be here :(  Most of my friends will be gone..have a few but not much...  UCI ~ Cathy will be there and Bryan and Jenn and Andrew and Ling and Chris and Stephen and DUY and Mark and Cianar and Justin and home will be soo much closer, too..  That's about all that I can think of right now but what choices..*SIGH*

         Hello world!!  *^_^*  I am FINALLY home to my baby and back from Chi-town.  What can I say about my trip?  Andrew, Gina, Kristine, and Lisa ~ OMG...I missed you all soooo much!!!  *HUgz*  To all of those that I could not visit, I am sooo sorry but maybe another time.  This time I was just limited in everything ~ time, mileage, energy, etc...I'm so sorry.  To Duy, thank you.  Thank you for putting up with me and my no sense of direction, my bad map reading skills (skills?  what skills?  exactly...), my inconsiderate lack of common sense, my absentmindedness, and just everything else!!  THANK YOU...*hugz*  Andrew ~ thank you for being so understanding and great.  I wish that we could have gone to church together and bonded through our common love of Christ.  But I guess lunch will do, huh?   *smilez*  Gina aka GiGi aka Georgie aka Silver aka G-Dawg..heehee...omg...thank you sooo much for everything from the 'steak and beer' for Duy and the 'authentic Viet cusine' even though you had the Thai pad thai.  *winks*  I had fun going to your English class and I hope that Professor Katz does NOT remember me..gosh, how embarrassing...I got caught falling asleep in a classroom thousands of miles away from my own school.  Oh, yeah, Gina, please thank Katie again for me.  Kris aka Marvie, babe, hope that your studies are going well..I'm sorry that we didn't get a chance to hang out more...and sorry about what happened...  And last but definately not the least, Lisa, babe, I LUV you!!!  Dude, the tears in your eyes made me start bawling.  I can't get over the similarities between Don and Duy and their whole 'you have no reason and logic!!'  heehee...man, you had Duy busting up over the whole comparison thing the next morning.  *hugz*  Besides these shoutouts to my buddies, i'll talk more about the trip later but I'm really pooped right now.  I was going to take another bus back to Isla Vista, but screw that...I ended up taking a taxi instead.  Now, I'm just beyond pooped. *bleah*  I'll write more later...*promise*

       Showing off your ass cause you thinkin it's a trend.  Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again.  You know I only say it cause I'm truly genuine.  Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem.  Babygirl, respect is just a minimum.  Niggas f*cked up and you still defending them.  ~ Lauryn Hill (Doo Wop)  So much is happening today.  I just wish that I was healthy enough to be prepared for it.  I dunno..I just wish that I was totally 100% for this because right now, 10% of me just feels dead.  I wish that I could open up and share what is on my mind...but from experience, I keep on holding back..I bite my tongue.  I don't say what's on my mind and in my heart anymore...I wait...and sometimes, time just isn't on my side..

       Oh, gosh, I feel so tired.  Leo was right.  I always do start off most of my blogs complaining about how tired I am.  And Pat, you were right.  Me giving up whining for Lent is like you giving up swearing.  It's not plausible.  Anyway, this quarter...is definately going to be something.  My classes?  There isn't a single one that I don't enjoy.  Man...that means that I'll be going to all of them.  I have the same professor for two of the classes which is pretty cool.  Professor Corum for my creative writing class..oh, gosh, even though I have an 8 page paper due on Monday, I get excited writing the paper.  I'm nearly down with my paper already.  Crazy stuff, huh?  And then, Professor Waid?  Gosh, I never thought that I could enjoy Twain as much as she put it into perspective.  *^_^*  She truly makes American literature interesting and enjoyable just by throwing in perverse points in Twain's writing.  Ambi...what can I say more about him?  I've purposely taken a class with him every quarter this year.  He's so great.  He's the one who wrote me every single one of my internships from the one in Illinois to the one at UC Berkeley.  He's great.  And I totally look forward to putting on Playsia and seeing my production take form.  It's going to be exciting.  So, school is good....  Work, on the other hand...gosh, if I didn't need the money so badly and if the family was doing better, I wouldn't be worrying about it.  I'd just want to take this quarter off of work.  I don't know.  I used to enjoy working but right now, I know that this sounds stupid, but I kinda just want to concentrate on school.  I want to concentrate on my tests for graduate school.  I want to be able to have the time to pick up the internships for my major.  I wish that money wasn't a factor.  I don't know.  I still have my health bills to pay off, my medical loans, and to top it all off, there's so much crap happening with the family that I have this obligation and desire to help out as much as I can.  I know that I came out of the beginning of this quarter with an extra two thousand, but Duy, don't get mad at me...I loaned my mother all of that.  I know that I could have used that money otherwise, but what can I say?  My family has given me so much and the least I can do is help out when I can.  My sisters...I love you so much!  There's so much crap happening from my medical condition and fears to my work-related problems and other personal things...but seriously, when I am with all of my lovely ladies, I start smiling...or through the worst of it and when we're stressing out together, I feel more comfortable knowing that I'm not alone.  I'm never alone with my p.sisters.  *hugz*  Being with you is like being in a separate entity where all my other problems cannot touch me.  To my friends, thank you so much for being so understanding and supportive.  The Lord truly blessed me with kindred spirits like you guys.  To the divas, truly and forever I have been grateful for divas like you two.  I look forward to Florida, Teeners and Cats, I promise that I'll try to come down and visit with you.  This summer will be one to remember.  To my Chicago buds, Lisa, Kris, B.Sis Jen, Gina, Andrew, Dave, Dan, Dan (the other one), Jeff, Jenny, Lily, and especially Dave and Mandy ~ you two are sooo cute and I totally am looking forward to being your bridesmaid..just remember who set you two up all those years ago!!  My Chicago buds, through all these years of separation, thank you for never giving up hope on me.  =o�  To my Irvine buds: Jenn, Bryan, John, Chris, Mark, Cianar, Cats I love you guys...I promise that I'll be back again visiting.  To my boys (Andrew-babe, Stephen, Chris, Cianar, Ling, Mark, Arthur) we'll be out for no rae bong and boba soon enough again..oh, there's so many more people to mention but I have to get back again tos chool...sorry, gots a meeting and class..

       Happy Birthday to you, Patrick!!  *^_^*  You're finally 23 years old...feeling it yet?  I'm happy yet so sad at the same time.  Man, it would have Eddie's 23rd birthday, too..I don't know.  I guess that I should talk about some of the more happier things in my life.  I got into my class...I got into my English 106 class!!  *^_^*  I love my p.sisters!!  They are so awesome!!  I know that things are getting rougher but trust me, it's all going to be so worth it!!  It's amazing how little things can bond people together, such as Counterstrike.  heehee..anyway...I'll go into those details another time.  *sigh*  I'm feeling so grossly sick right now.  It's really bothering me the fact that my throat is killing me and feels so swollen up.  I just threw up.  Eww..and I don't know.  I feel weak.  Man, this couldn't come at a worse time.  I need to be healthy right now.  *sigh*

       Where do I begin?  Bad news?  Good news?  Random thoughts...let's start from the bottom of that list.  You know when you meet someone and there's just something that intrigues you about that person that you almost want to go out of your way to get to know them?  Ehh..anyway, man..what a day!  I worked from 5:15 to 10am; went home and showered and then, went to a doctor's appointment at 11, had work from 12-1pm.  Then, I had a class and then, another class...where gosh...I biked like a madwoman home just to sit there and pump out a four page paper in 35 minutes where whether or not I get into English 106 depends on.  Gosh, I really want to get in..*fingers crossed*  Then, I went to Asian Am 142..have I told you how much I adore this professor?  He is sooo awesome!  Ambi is great.  This is the third quarter in a row that I'll be taking him.  I went to go contest my grade from last quarter when he pointed out that I received the highest grade in the class...*shrug* Alright, not complaining anymore.  Anyway, what I'm so psyched about is the huge play that I wrote last quarter for his playwrighting class...well, he's putting that into production and I get to direct my own play.  I'm so excited!!  To add onto that, for Playsia, I'll be acting in four plays and directing my own play.  I'm so excited about the whole situation!!  *^_^*  And all of you out there that can make it, I better see you there on June 4th when we put our final production out.  It's going to be so wonderful!!  Now, to the bad news...my godfather is dying of liver cancer.  Gosh, I dont' know what to say.  He treated me like one of his children.  Actually, he has three sons so I was like his daughter.  I don't know.  He did so much for my family back then.  I plan to go visit him.  He lives in Foster City, California.  If possible, please pray for him.  His name is Peter Lai.  Please pray for him...I'm going to go now because I've got tears in my eyes =o(

       Oh, goodness...I don't know where to begin.  Right now, I'm so tired of everything.  I'm struggling deep inside to find the strength to continue carrying on.  Sometimes, I wish that my life could go back to normality instead of worrying about mindless things that I do worry about.  I'm really looking forward to seeing my sisters tonight.  They manage to make me smile.  I don't know how but they do.  When I'm with them, I feel a lighter load upon my shoulders.  I'm also really looking forward to AACF this Wednesday.  I really need it.  I can't fully explain it but I need it.  I need the fellowship and I need the sweet release.  I'm determined this quarter to bring up my grades.  I mean, seriously, I didn't do that bad last quarter but I didn't exactly ace last quarter.  It was so hard..and I brought in mostly B's which isn't satisfactory for the honors program.  I don't really want to go into detail about what's wrong right now but I'm sure that God does everything in my life for a reason.  I just pray that I'm strong enough and I pray for strength to be stronger.  I worry about my family so much and I wish that I could be with them right now but at the same time, I don't know if I could handle everything, too.  *sigh*  I'm just so tired right now and sleepy.  I was up until 2am but I had work at 5:15am...and I'll be out tonight until midnight with classes until 8pm and other things going on, as well..I don't know..I'm going to stop whining and go back to unpacking from my norcal trip.  Oh, yeah!  To the UCSC aKDphi, thank you for everything and your hospitality.  The brief time that I spent in the glow of your sisterhood is inspiration enough and I hope that my sisters and I can grow as close you all are with each other.

       Before I leave now for my roadtrip, I guess that I should talk about a few things.  It's amazing how you realize the true worth of something when it's lost.  What's going through my head?  My results from the doctor..talking to my Godfather who is dying and wants me to be there..stressing about all these little things...school..work..I got so scared about this morning about my job.  I'm quitting one of my jobs next week.  Well, I'll be giving them my two weeks next week.  ACK!!..I gotta run now..

       Oh, goodness..my eyes are so puffy and red right now.  I've been crying nonstop for the past couple of hours.  It's finally over.  Duy and me.  It's been a confusing mess for so long and there's been so much pain for so long.  We said goodbye tonight.  It is finalized now.  He has finally come to acceptance.  He said all these things that made me cry even harder.  God, he said the 'l' word.  He told me that he loved me.  He knows what kind of effect that has on me.  He knows how that word hits me so hard.  He told me all these sweet things that made me fall for him in the first place.  He brought up all of our good memories together.  He told me how sorry he was for our bad moments and we had made it through them together.  And that experience had made us stronger.  I can't fully explain why I cried so much, but there was just so much emotion caught up in everything.  I don't know...I don't friggin' know...

       After soo much talk of how homesick I am, guess what?!?  My family is coming up to Santa Barbara to visit me on Wednesday.  I only have a four hour block of free time that afternoon but I'm praying that I'll get to see them.  I miss them sooo much!!  I can hardly wait to see them again.  I don't know if my dad can come on up but my mommy will be here and my two youngest siblings.  *^_^*  Well, it's Palm Sunday!!  Easter is soon coming up...Counterstrike...Starcraft...ooh...*sigh*  Anyway, I have to run now to the Special Olympics...oh, how happy I am!  I get to see my family and my sisters soon!!

       What a weekend.  It is not even over.  Where do I even begin?  Our presentations were this Friday and oh goodness, thank you to all those that were there.  Thank you for coming all the way out to Santa Barbara, especially to those who traveled a long and arduous road battling traffic and the rain.  Thank you, my Big Sis...*hugz*  You spoiled me rotten with your gifts.  Thank you, my p.sisters and as I stood alongside you, I was fighting back tears of pride and tears of joy and tears of amazement.  I broke down crying a few times that night.  I don't know what I would have done without you by my side.  You were my strength that fueled me and kept me going.  All of Friday was spent with you and you alone know how precious that means to me.  But seriously, thank you to everyone that showed up.  I was a little intimidated and shocked and surprised to see so many people show up.  It meant alot.  It was a pretty big deal and to see so many lovely ladies touched me.  When I spoke my words, my heart was bursting with emotion and nervousness.  Other than that, Milton, thank you.  Thank you for coming down to visit me this weekend.  It meant alot to see you and spend time with you.  Thank you for being there for me and listening to me rant and rave.  I can only wish you the best of luck in your endeavors and hope that all goes well for you.  Two words for you Milton: Interesting and amazing.  You and your hella nor cal slang.  =o�  Anyway, though, it really touched me that you would come all this way down to spend some time with me and I hope that you have a safe ride back up.  I enjoyed spending time with you and I guess that I'll see you again before the end of the quarter.  If I can't come up for that one weekend, then, I'll be seeing you once we're done.  *hugz*  Take care..  Well, I need to get going now to Church..Palm Sunday.  *^_^*  Other than that, I'll be volunteering at the Special Olympics and then, meetings afterwards and sometime, I need to find time to write up that four page paper for Ambi's class and the eight page paper for Prof. Corum's class, too..*sigh*

       I'm so ticked right now.  Seriously, people, I'm not asking for a lecture.  I'm not asking you to tell what's right and wrong in my life.  You don't think that I have a friggin' clue to what's wrong in my life?  I'll tell you this.  There's so much right now going on in my life that you have no clue about.  Right now, there are few people that I'm trusting about my life, and you know what?  If I'm not sharing something with you, it's not your fault.  I just want my space right now.  I'm in grieving.  I'm trying to smile through the pain.  I'm in frustration and things seem so difficult but just because I'm not letting life's downfalls get me all moody and sh*t like that, that doesn't mean I'm not going through a rough time.  I'm just trying to deal with it.  Seriously, LEAVE ME FRIGGIN ALONE.  You don't know what I'm going through.  So, don't try and understand that you know what it's like to be me.  I've got enough problems.  F*ck this..honestly, I've been so patient and trying to be nice.  If I snap at you, you'll know exactly why.  And my friends and family know how often it is that I'll snap at them.

       Dang...It's almost 6am and I haven't slept yet.  Kinda worried about Mason but at the same time, really stressing about school.  I don't know.  I really need my sleep but at the same time, I'm determined not to fall behind in classes.  I can't fall behind.  I will not fall behind.  Work has been something.  I know that I've been sacrificing alot this quarter and I've been sacrificing work and my health.  There's so much running through my head.  I have an appointment with the bank to talk about another loan for medical bills because my insurance won't cover alot of miscellaneous stuff.  At the same time, there's so much that I'm stressing and worrying about.  My head just isn't fully here right now.  I'm so tired.  Gosh...I am so tired but thank the Lord that I am alive to feel tired..*^_^*

       *^_^*  I don't know why I'm smiling today, but I am.  I heard back from my doctor today.  I have some hope.  Any ray of sunshine is greatly appreciated.  Yesterday, God showed me that through a friend.  He reminded me again why I wake up every morning.  He reminded me how precious life truly is.  Life hasn't been easy but if it was so easy, we wouldn't appreciate it.  We would take it for granted.  We need a challenge.  There's more that I want to repeat from what I said last night, but I don't have time for that right now.  Time...gosh, how is there so little of it?  I have class in fifteen minutes.  School?  Seriously, I still love school.  I'm so tired but it's not from school...  anyway, last words ~ Matt and Rocky ~ hang in there, pledge bros, the end is coming soon and you guys will make it.  *HUGZ* My pledge sisters, our time is nearing and the bonds that I've developed with you..are beyond words..and bring me tears..tears of joy of our accomplishments, our failures, our drawbacks, our successes, our laughter, our memories...and how the beginning is just around the corner...We're just ont he path to the end of the beginning...I LOVE YOU sooo much...all of ya!!

       SH*T...I need to stop sobbing right now.  I'm just crying and pouring my heart out in front of my computer.  What's wrong?  What's all this crap that I keep on hinting about in my life?  Alright, I'm going to spill some but some of it..I'm just not ready to share at all.  So, I'll just share some of the less personal and secretive stuff.  I have definite results from the doctors and have scheduled for surgery time already and treatment, too.  It's not good.  It doesn't look good.  My chances are so slim right now.  I thought that I was doing okay, but I guess that when you take things for granted, that's when life decides to screw you over.  Just remember that.  NEVER ever take anything for granted.  Darn it.  I found out last week that my Godfather was dying and I was trying to plan a trip up north to San Jose to visit him in the hospital.  He called me up asking me when I was going to be there.  I told him that I'd prolly go up there next month because I had school and other stuff going on.  I had a rough day today.  I had work at 5:15am and didn't get off until 10am.  Once I got home, I had to finish an eight page paper.  In addition to that, I had to finish up my taxes.  I had work at noon.  Amazingly enough, the Lord was watching over me and let my paper just flow pretty easily and my taxes - I didn't come across too many difficulties with them.  I had work and then, classes from 1pm to 7:45pm.  And then, in between class and practice, my mom left me a voice message saying that my Godfather had passed away that morning.  God, why am I so stupid?  Why didn't I just rush up north in a heartbeat like I should have??  Why couldn't I have been there?  Why did I take him for granted?  I hate myself for not being there when I could have been there.  Thank you, my pledge sisters.  You, my sisters, have been amazing.  You make me smile and distract me.  Being with you is like being in a whole new world where my problems are temporarily set aside.  I'm sorry though that I couldn't stay any longer.  My heart was breaking inside.  There has just been so much happening.  In case, I didn't say anything, for sure, I'll be quitting my job at De La Guerra because it conflicts with my health and I need that extra time to recover.  I hope that I have enough in savings to pull it all together.  I really don't want to get another loan and then, spend the next however many years attempting to pay it off.  Just too much on my mind.  I keep on praying because that is the only thing that I can do right now.  Lord, show me the light int his tunnel.  I leave it all up to you....

       I'm so tired right now and so frustrated.  Why does that seem to be a common thread?  Why?  You know what's ironic....I began my evening frustrated and then, being with my pledge sisters and talking to our pledge mom for like an hour tonight made me feel alot better...btw, we have the bestest pledge mom ever!  I luv her..she's so awesome..just like I have the bestest big sis, too...  Where did I go wrong?  Where the heck did I go wrong?  What always seems to frustrate me and upset me?  The same reason over and over again..how much more can I handle this?  No more.  No more.  This time is for sure.

       Okay, okay...I know that I've been lagging.  I wish that I could explain what has been happening in my life.  Let's just make a quick runthrough life, I guess.  School ~ it's there.  I still do enjoy my classes but I'm so tired during them and I find myself barely making it through class without wanting to doze off.  But next week, I have two midterms and two papers....but the following week...some of you know what week I'm talking about...I have three midterms and two papers plus ...stuff...*sigh*  Fellowship ~ I find myself leaning on Christ, especially in these hard times of life..I find myself growing stronger and stronger.  Health ~ Gosh, I wish that I could give good news about this but there isn't any good news.  Just frustration after frustration.  I don't want to go more into detail about this because it just makes me sad.  =o(  Work ~ well...I'm quitting my manager position and next week is going to be my last week...after two years of working for the university in housing and residential, I'm quitting..makes me sad but at the same time, it's time to move along..my other job?  I'm so tired..  Friends ~ I miss you all sooo much!!  *hugz*  I promise that this summer will be different.  I will totally be making the effort to be with you guys...this right now just means so much to me..I know that you understand.  Thanx for the patience and the understanding *hugz*  to my boys ~ thank you...*hugz*  Family ~ I'm sorry..I'm so sorry...I won't be there for Grace's confirmation or Steve's First Communion..please understand that...I'm so sorry..  Duy ~ I don't know what's happening again...things are changing and I'm not sure of anything anymore.  I care but at the same time, I'm very wary about opening up.  Right now, with everything happening, I know that I'm not being fair to you and for that, I'm sorry.  but I am not sorry of who I am and I'm not going to change who I am...I'm sorry.  I accepted you for who you are..but I'm not going to change who I am to fit anyone..if anyone falls in love with me, it should be for who I am..not who I have the potential to be.  Let me grow on my own time..  to my SISTERS...I adore you guys so much.  Hang in there..side by side.  We will get everything down and we will accomplish our dreams together...together we dared to hope...together we received the chance..together we have worked and laughed...together we have shared memories and together, we will reach our dream!!!  *HUGZ*

       Okay, I'm taking a little break from writing my paper to write this about my weekend.  To my sisters, thank you for showing me something incredible.  I have learned so much from each and every single one of you.  I have seen a side of me that I wasn't sure that existed.  We saw this a year ago as a challenge.  We whole-heartedly accepted the challenge and now, it only can get harder.  Do we accept?  OF COURSE...if it was easy to receive and if we could cut corners to reach our destination, we would not fully appreciate what we have today.  We would not be as strong as we are together right now.  I came out of this weekend loving you, my sisters, more and more.  Through our ups and downs, we've grown together....darn it...I'm always running out of time...more later..

       The first woman was created from the rib of a man, she was not made from his head to top him, nor from his feet to be trampled on, but from his side to be equal with him, under his arm to be protected, and near his heart to be loved.  If God had wanted us to have "experience" before meeting the right one, he would have taken more ribs out of the first man and not just one.  everything righteous is meant for a purpose. for happiness. for perfection.

       Thank you and I'm sorry seem to be two common phrases that I seem to be saying alot to many different people.  I worked my last shift at De La Guerra on Friday..yesterday?  Wow...time has definately taken on a new meaning.  After two years with some of these people, man, I cried when I left...this bites.  I seem to be crying so much lately.  I hate the fact that I've gotten all emotional and crap like that lately.  That bites.  UGH.  btw, Rocky, thank you for being this amazing source of support lately *hugz* I really appreciate it.

       Gosh...there is too much to say.  First and foremost, thank to those of you that have supported me.  I cannot begin to express my gratitude.  I'm sorry for those of you that I hurt.  Sometimes, those sacrifices that count the most are the ones that are unspoken.  They don't feel like sacrifices because you love them so much that you would do anything for them.  My sisters, these past few days, I have shared so much with you that no one else could ever understand and that is what bonds us.  I looked at each one of you last night and I had tears welling up in my eyes as I realized the very reasons why I chose to pledge.  My sisters.  My pledge sisters.  There's so much going on and there's so much happening, but with you guys here for me, I know that I'll be okay, I hope.  I have tears streaming down my face right now.  My family, I'm so sorry that I'm not there.  I wish with all of my heart that I could be there and show you guys how much I love you.  I do love you so much but right now..things are so tough.  I feel as though I am at my weakest physical point ever.  I'm so scared because I don't know the truth yet.  I don't know the future.  I can't even rely on myself.  Health-wise, I hate the situation that I am in right now.  I don't want to say anything but at the same time, I hate the inability that I'm feeling.

Everyone that has supported me through the past year, especially the past four months, THANK YOU...hopefully, everything will be winding down.  Thank you so much for your support.  I know that I have made a lot of sacrifices but you guys were so wonderful and understanding.  Thank you sooo much...gosh...everything...so much.  But it's worth it.  I know it is.  Thank you everyone..I cannot even begin to list names, but just THANK YOU...

       "Thou! Thou! Thou! Thou! Thou! Thou! Thou! Thou!" - Gau, FFVI  "You got lost didn't you? Separated from someone you love......? Silly thing..." - Tifa, FFVII  "To be forgetten is worse than death." - Freya, FFIX  Have I truly forgotten you?  And all the memories that we shared?  "You got lost didn't you? Separated from someone you love......? Silly thing..." - Tifa, FFVII Love is not blind.  It sees more, not less.  But because it sees more, it is willing to see less.  Sometimes you know in your heart you love someone, but you have to go away before your head can figure it out.  As Virgil would say, "Nunc scio quit sit amor."  Loving, knowing that you are going to get hurt is like living knowing that you are going to die. "We don't see things as they are, we see things as we are." - Anais Nin    "Relationships--of all kinds--are like sand held in your hand. Held loosely, with an open hand, the sand remains where it is. The minute you close your hand and squeeze tightly to hold on, the sand trickles through your fingers. You may hold on to some of it, but most will be spilled. Held loosely, with respect and freedom for the other person, it is likely to remain intact. But hold too tightly, too possessively, and the relationship slips away and is lost." - Kaleel Jamison  One of life's disappointments includes meeting someone that means the world to you. But only to find that in the end it was never meant to be and you just have to let go.  Letting go of someone you love is the hardest thing to do. It's going to hurt and you'll lose that someone but you'll never lose your love for him or her. That love is endless.  Trust takes years to build but only takes seconds to destroy it.  I used to always say that Love is sacrifice.  You would do anything for someone that you loved.  You don't sit there and count how many times you've been there for that person.  You don't keep count or track of whose turn it is to call.  You just do it.  You do it because you want to.  You do it out of love.  Love is sacrifice.  Look at the Lord.  He gave up his only son for us.  Our parents made the ultimate sacrifice out of love.  They let go.  Letting go is a huge sacrifice and it is the ultimate sacrifice of love.  To let go of someone to let them grow.  I didn't realize this until Kent and I broke up five years ago.  Back then, I wanted a second chance so badly, but I grew to realize that if I really loved him like I said I did, I would let him go.  I had to realize that I wasn't the best for him and if I really loved him, I would want the best for him.  Like the sand analogy, I talk about a butterfly.  If a butterfly lands on you, you can't hold it too loosely otherwise, it will just fly away because it doesn't feel safe enough.  If you squeeze it too hard, you may suffocate it.  Hold it just right..but if it does fly away, it will come back to stay on its own accord.  I have always said...if it felt that good to have loved the wrong one, imagine how it will feel to love the right one.  Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.  After all, it is the broken heart that hurts not the love.  Love is sacrifice.

       Gosh, well, how am I?  What a weird question...health wise, I feel like I'm slipping.  After treatment, I feel so weak and not quite fully here.  I'm so tired most of the time.  School wise, I'm just trying to stay on top of things.  Struggling to be okay.  Religiously, it's the only thing that I can hold onto right now.  My pledge sisters...they are one source of strength for me.  Relationship wise?  Ha!  What relationship?  I'm back in my whole fear of commitment thing again and don't want to get involved anytime soon.  Relationship=drama and that's the last thing that I need right now.  I just don't want to deal with any right now.  There's enough drama happening.  =o�  Other than that, I'm just very determined to make it as far as I can in this state..just wish that I could shake this whole icky feeling...

Funny thing is, this is the first time that I'm truly spilling about it.  Oddly enough, I haven't turned to anyone about this.  I usually at least turn to someone but this time around, I'm just so fed up with it that I don't want to tell anyone.  Just so tired of all this sh*t that's happening.  There's enough crap going on and then this?!?  *aiya*

It's okay, Tim..it's not your fault.  I just wanted it up and that's all...*sigh*  I'm just being really stupid right now.  I had an eventful and busy day...  I dunno anymore.  I watched Pearl Harbor this afternoon..man, it made me cry so much.  Thanks, Ed, for having those napkins otherwise I would have been this slobbery mess.  *bleah*  Oh, well.  I miss my pledge sisters!!

       Dang food coma...dag-nabbit...I ate sooo friggin' much today...well, it all started this morning at church...I friggin' had two doughnuts and a cup of coffee...I came home and then, my pledge sisters (#7 and #10 - the SLO lil' sis') called me up to go eat so we go get some lunch from Little Asia..it's all good, right?  And then, my roommate and I start chilling with my snacks and then, Mike comes over to study and we're snacking up some more...then, I go visit Thoai at work and she gets off in an hour.  So, we head over to Starbucks cuz I start to fall asleep while studying.  Then, we decide that we're gonna head over to my place but we want snacks, so we get Freebird's nachos with beef and chicken *yummy* and we're just chilling at my place studying and eating up a storm!  After that, our other pledge sisters call us (#3 and #10) to go get more food later...We meet up with #10 (the other Donna) to go to Starbucks again but they're friggin' closed so instead, we go to McConnell's which is right next door.  Dayam...ice-cream...and then, ...we go pick up Annie for In and Out food....*ugh*..now, food coma...I just wanna pass out..

       Wow..my time back here seems to have just flown by.  But I do have to return to Santa Barbara and head back to the workfield and start with my crazy summer school schedule.  I'm still pretty worn out and groggy though.  Hope that I can pull myself together and make it through.  Sometimes, if I pause for a moment, I think that I get worried and scared about myself.  But I really don't want to think about it..just figure that I keep on putting one foot in front of the other and keep on going..I'll make it in the end and even if I don't, at least, I know that I tried..  *^_^*  But no sad thought and no pessimistic thinking right now.  I can hardly wait to see my girls again and kinda just melt back into my little bubble world where I feel as though I have some control over my life.

I really don't know how to say it.  See, with my other ex-boyfriends, we did start off as friends first..so when the relationship ended, yeah, it was hard but not that hard to go back to friendship.  However, with Duy, from the very beginning, we weren't friends.  I guess...I just don't know how to act or be around him.  I can't treat him like a friend because to me, he's never actually been a friend.  Does any of that make sense?  *deep ponderance*

Our website is kinda up but I promise that I'll be working on that.  Just been really caught up with other things, especially summer school.  *bleah*  Oh, yeah, happy belated birthdays to D'Anne, Kristine, Leo, Milton, and Eddie.  heehee...  oh, well.

       Other than everything, just really busy and caught up with everything... urlLink including UCSB aKDPhi   and other than that...just tired and easily exhausted.  I miss people alot..Teeners, you especially.  I'm so sorry that I didn't get to meet up with you but I promise that Labor Day weekend is all about you and me.  *promise*  Well, Eddie's back in cali...we gotta go play now.  *^_^*  I don't know what really to say..there's so much going on but I'm kinda keeping myself distanced from reality and everyone else.  Kinda can't explain quite yet but maybe some day I will...but for now, just not ready to share.  Weird, huh?  When I was younger and much more naive, I didn't mind sharing my thoughts with everyone.  Now, it's different.  I'm more private and so forth.  Not so sure about the idea about people knowing about my personal life and I almost can't help but think...why do you care to know about my life....

Too many characters to memorize...eek!  Well, other than that though, I've been busy working and I really love my job ~ they're so sweet~!  They threw me a little party today...speaking of party, my 20th birthday has past now and I'm well past my teenage years.  To the girls that shared my birthday with me, I love you all!!  A huge hug and thank you to Donna (my roomie), Jin, Gina, and Thoai.  You guys made it so awesome!!  To the SJSU and Stanford girls, *hugz* and thanx for lunch..it was wonderful meeting you all.  And to the Cal KDPhis, *hugz*  thanx for a last minute sisterhood...such a great weekend...didn't expect to see all the people that I did from Vicki to my big sis and etc...you all are so grrrrr...eat!  *^_^*

       Okay, I'm going to try to write more just because I realize that this past summer has been my Internet off time and I hella miss it!!  *^_^*  heehee...I can hardly wait to go back to Santa Ynez but at the same time, I really like Garden Courts, too.  This weekend has been an interesting one so far.  One word for now.  Genevive.  No further explanations though.  Other than that, Jin, babe, thank you soooo much for everything...for being there for me and for helping me undergo a makeover.  heehee...I can't really explain it, but this weekend was the weekend of all weekends for physical change.  I felt that I needed to change something so I decided to go for my physical appearance.  Really trippy thought actually.  Jin kept on saying all of last night how I would be the last person to ever dye my hair since I have 'virgin' hair....never dyed before.  And then, just a different makeup style...=o�  I don't know why but I needed to do something different and drastic...can't really explain it.  Other than that, we met up with Karyn, a Baylor University alum, akdphi charter, baybee!!  *^_^*  And we got a little taste of Lambda Phi Epsilon etiquette.  *^_^*  heeheee...Karyn, it was great meeting you and your bf ~ hope that your date went well and you two had fun...have a safe drive back to Texas!  *^_^*

       Am I a coward for not wanting to fight for something that my heart wants?  Am I a coward for putting someone else ahead of myself?  Am I coward for denying what I want for the benefit of another?  I don't know what I'm doing anymore.  I think that I'm doing the right thing even though he disagrees.  Have you ever wondered how two people can be together for years and then, decide to split up.  Things happen, I guess.  At the same time, it's almost not about those two people anymore.  It's something more...it's about the people that it can affect.  The different aspects of life that it affects.  I don't know anything anymore ~ that's my main conclusion.  I don't understand it.  Someone that I know thought that he knew what he was doing and thought that he was in love with a girl.  Now, I see him testing her and now claiming that he's not so sure if he loves her at all.  But if he is insisting on staying with her, doesn't that mean that he does love her.  I mean, he is giving her a chance.  At the same time, I understand why he would be so mad but I don't think that it's right that he's playing games and testing her.  I know that I shouldn't be speaking since things happen and you just react.  Reaction is a funny thing.  Have you ever wondered why you react a certain way when stuff happens?  Have you ever wondered what makes you shudder?  Or sends chills down your spine?  Or what makes you crack up so hard?  Or blush and choke up?  Sorry, I'm being really stupid right now but I have all this crap going through my head...guess that I should head back to the RBR and study some more...*bleah*  I don't want to study anymore...guess that I have to though...Three and a half more weeks of summer school...and then, yippee...my one week of summer vacation..which won't really be a vacation since the writing department needs me there to work.  *sigh*  Anyway...I'm listening to Stevie B's Dream About You...sad song...but I still love it.  Odd, isn't it?  You know what I'd love to do one of these days (don't know when since I never seem to have the time anyway) is just relax for a day and clean the house and watch Kimagure Orange Road and not think about anything at all...take a mini vacation from life, in general and not deal with anything ~ guess that I'd have to turn off my cell phone for a day and I don't know if I can do that..  Yes, I admit it.  I'm addicted to my cell phone ~ see Yenny, I can admit it.  I cannot live without my cell phone.  No, Joe, don't get any stupid ideas of stealing my phone and throwing away in the ocean.  I know that it's always going off but I can't help it...  =o(  Guilty as charged..

       For those of you in Love, or getting out of Love, here`s something to think about:   One of the most valuable truths in love is that you never know that you will find around he next corner. Try as we may to understand the peaks and valleys of romance, it seems that as humans, we inevitably end up scratching our heads. Fortunately, there is always hope and a deeper truth to be found in love`s game. I think Woody Allen put`s it best when he wrote,� The heart is a very resilient little muscle.� I have often wondered where our souls fit into this grand plan. Many have asked me, over the years, to define the term `soul mate". Defining this word coupling proves itself a difficult task. Most people`s understanding of this concept relates to their belief that in life, we all have one "true love". I have heard many people say they are seeking their "other half". Artists and poets alike have brought illumination to the subject through literature and songs. Indeed,  throughout the history of humankind, lies an inexhaustible fascination with the mysteries of the soul. Fate plays a big role in the hand of love as we search for connection, familiarity and destiny. We all seek a love that is "meant to be". According to karmic traditions, a soul mate is someone we have known in a previous lifetime. Our friends in the present are companions from the past. In Hindu traditions, karma is interwoven with the relationships and experiences you have with people in your life. Following this formula, our souls evolve each time we learn a lesson. If we act with good conscience and truth, we will come back in our next lifetime on a greater spiritual plane. (Our purpose here on earth is positive work and giving of ourselves to others because we  won`t get another chance to do so, not because we want to earn a brownie or two. Reincarnation is a pile of *bleep*.) Yet, theology is not a defining factor because in the global community, we all embrace different traditions and teachings. The universal truth is thatwe all seek love by joining with others, bringing along our individuality and  our uniqueness.  I have fallen in love a few times, finding only one certainty:  - Love is an inextinguishable force. It arrives when it wants and departs  when it pleases.  - Love manifests itself in every unique and wonderful possibility.  The perplexity lies in recognizing love, finding the real thing. Finding a connection with another is not difficult if your heart is open. The "knowing" is the hard part. In life and in spirit, hope springs eternal and love must be part of that. Considering our fantasies and longings, we need to believe in the mystery of companionship and eternal love. There is no doubt in mind that in order to find love, we must first believe in love. It is always  faith, which delivers the answers. Hope springs eternal when we meet someone with whom we find that connection. A sense of wholeness abounds as we sail on the ship of love, destiny being our ocean. Through years of personal exploration, I have grown to believe that soul mates are about more than the heart. I believe that a soul mate is any person who enters our lives with greater meaning and purpose. Our souls evolve through loving others. Our lives evolve through the paths we choose. What counts in life and in love is the ability to know individual truth. If you make love your journey, finding your soul mate will be the destination

       I'm currently in between class and work.  Just random thoughts just flowing through my head.  After last night's conversations and a very very very sleepless night, I don't know what to think anymore.  I feel so frustrated and torn right now.  I realized that last night, I played so many different roles that I found myself lost.  Who am I?  I'm a sister to Grace and Cindy...I'm a daughter to my parents...I'm a struggling and tired student...I'm a aKDPhi sister...I'm a friend...I'm an ex-girlfriend...and I'm someone who might be something more to another.  I didn't sleep at all last night being all these different people to others.  Because of that, I feel almost lost and confused on who I am.  I worry and I dream.  I thought that I knew stuff but it turns out that maybe I don't know anything anymore....I know that I'm not making any sense, but ...  that is how I feel....  *confused smile*

       Have you ever thought about this...I was talking to this one guy friend of mine...well, technically about a few months back, he used to like me but I was currently in a relationship back then.  Anyway, I'm all talking to him and he keeps on mentioning how he wants to go to SB to go hang out or something like that.  Okay...and then, during our conversation, another friend that I have that knows him ims me and she and I start chatting up and she mentions how she can't stand him because he's so whupped by his gf...he never mentioned his gf to me so I wanna know the story cuz I love hearing love stories *^_^*  heehee...anyway, so I start questioning him about his love life and he totally denies it.  UGH...why would he deny such a thing.  So, my friend ims him and those two start talking about his gf...he tells her that he's going to go drive down later tonight to see her and stuff.  I don't get why he can't just tell me about her.  It's not like I'm jealous or care about him having a gf.  I'm happy for him but it's kinda hard being happy for someone if they won't share.  My friend thinks that he still has feelings and he doesn't want me to know about his gf....I don't get it.  I don't think that I ever will get it.  Oh, well.  *bleah*  Kinda bugs me but it kinda doesn't.  I've got other things on my mind.  Some stuff that I'd rather not share but this I guess that I'll blog about...  I'm not sure if any of this sounds stupid or what, but here goes.  Whenever my crush calls me or when I talk to him, I feel alot better and I always smile when I hear the special ringtone that I have set up for him so I know that it's him calling.  I'm scared sh*tless though that I might get hurt again.  I totally want to trust him and just let go.  I know that I'm not fake around him and if anything, I get kinda giddy but overall, I'm pretty me.  I'm the simple basic Donna.  =o�  But at the same time, a part of me wants to hold back, scared to let go and scared to risk getting hurt again.  And another thing...I don't think it's fair for him.  I don't know what to think.  I feel bad in the sense that I don't have this whole heart to give to him.  I've loved before and I've lost, but a part of me has remained in the past.  I know that I've left that behind in the past and now is now.  I don't even know how to say this.  Things have already begun moving for the two of us.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know if I could just say, "no, this isn't going to work out..let's just go back to being friends" because if I say that, it's just me running away from a chance and me denying myself a chance to explore this...is it worth the risk though?  dayam...so scared.  At the same time, what if we do try something and it doesn't work out.  What then?  I lose him as something more...and I lose him as my best guy friend...and I lose a part of my heart all over again.  As much as I will deny that I hold back from him, I already have loved him as my best guy friend.  I don't know what I'd do if I lost that...  I don't want us to fade into the past....I don't want us to be just a fling.  I don't want a fling...I don't want a temporary thing anymore.  At first and for a while, I didn't really care and I had this huge fear of commitment.  Don't get me wrong.  That fear is still very strongly there, but I know this much...I'm willing to try...which is more than anything that I've done..  I don't know what I'm saying anymore when I really should be doing my homework...well, guess that I'll be off to the computer lab to do my Chinese labs.  *bleah*

       There's also something else going on, too.  I've been debating on whether or not I wanted to blog about it just because I've been very private about this.  It's about this crush that I've had on and off for the past three years on one of my best guy friends.  I never wanted to bring it up because I feared his reaction and what if it messed up our friendship.  Anyway, last month, I stupidly got the nerve to tell him.  I don't know what possessed me to do it, but I did...  now, that he's back in california and I've seen him a few times, I'm not too sure where this is going.  I know that he makes me happy just as he always has been able to.  I know that our friendship is still very comfortable and I still adore him in that sense.  I know that our trust in each other, if anything, is growing stronger and stronger as we open up more to each other.  Right now, we're just taking it one step at a time...letting time take its toil...missing him though..

       I am feeling so drained right now.  Last night, I definately needed it.  Thank you, my girls, my pledge sisters for a great meeting.  You all made me laugh and I felt good again.  It was a good break from the frustrations of life.  And Eddie, thank you for last night.  Thanks for not getting too mad at me for falling asleep on you even though you just sat there on the phone in absolute silence for 45 minutes.  =o�  heehee...and thanx for putting up with my funky rambling and weird thoughts...  There's still so much going on and the little bits of relaxation that I do get are greatly appreciated.  Right now, I'm at work.  I really do enjoy my job here so much..here at the writing department is like my little oasis away from a problem filled reality.  I don't know where to begin...there is just alot on my mind.  Chinese 3 is almost over..now, it's just alot of cramming tests and last minute reviews before the final on Friday.  In addition to that, just all this other stuff is consuming my time.  I constantly worry about my family and I wish that I could be there more for them.  There are other personal/social obligations/situations that I don't really feel like delving into that are constantly on my mind, too.  I guess that I am my usual busy self that feels slightly overwhelmed right now....

       So much is running through my head but it's nothing that I feel like sharing.  I can't fully describe..actually, I can't describe it.  I just feel so lost and confused.  I just went out and ran and ran and ran until my body couldn't run anymore (which yes, I know, I can't run very far as Joe can tell you since I'm so darn out of shape *sigh*).  I don't know anything anymore and I realize how confused I feel.  To my pledge sisters, thanx for being there and still supporting me despite me.  To my family, I hella miss you all.  I wish that I could have spent more time with you. I'm going to try my hardest to be able to go down south next weekend to be with all of you again.  I hella miss you all....To all the aKDPhi sisters that I met and hung out with this past weekend, you all are so wonderful *^_^*....UCR, you ladies hosted an awesome retreat ~ greatly appreciated!  I guess that I need to get something off of my mind.  I feel that I have been running away fromt his one problem for a hella long time.  In fact, I've been running away since March of this year.  Because of this problem, I've avoided going back and I've been keeping myself hella busy in Santa Barbara with school, working two jobs, and pledging.  Because of this problem, other problems surfaced.  For the past few weeks, I've been feeling so guilty and I feel as though I've been this terrible persona nd haven't been there to support people that I love.  I had a family member call me up tonight to tell me how disappointed she was in me because I haven't been there for anyone.  I've been too busy and selfish here in SB.  I dunno what to think right now.  I'm just feeling hella down and I think that I'm gonna go shower and maybe crash...or maybe run again..

I hope and long for someone.. who can be patient and caring at the same time.. hold my hand and not rush into anything while I slowly take down my own wall.. brick by brick...  because once it's down...it's down by my own accord.

       Yay...  Donna gets to go home tonight and see the family.  Aunt Margaret will be there with Michael and Michelle...considering the fact that I haven't seen them in a long time makes it more special that I'll be seeing them tonight.  *^_^*  Home sweet home...for not very long.  Since I'll be leaving tomorrow morning with Jenn to go up north to see Tina!!  *^_^*  And see Arthur, Robert, Ling, and other peeps, too..but mostly to see Teeners..heehee...  Sad newsflash:  Eddie's leaving for New York tomorrow night...I kinda wanted to stay in LA so I could surprise him and go to the airport to say bye to him...but I already know that I'm going to miss him alot...kinda don't want to add to it right now.  Hopefully, I'll get a chance to see him tonight though.  I dunno...my schedule is all whack.  *bleah*  As for other things...I dunno...don't even want to get into anything else...just have so much on my mind right now...can't really explain it.  I guess that I've been taking some time to think lately...

       Right now, I'm so frustrated with the financial aid office.  Apparently something happened..hearing so many stupid rumors of what really happened and all the electricity on campus was shut off twice.  It's happened twice already.  ARGH...why am I frustrated?  Because the computer systems were down therefore, once again, I don't know what's going on.  For once in my life, I would like to know what's going on.  For once...This weekend, I'm so looking forward to.  I'm going up north to spend time with Tina.  I don't care what we do.  For all I could care, we could sit in her apartment all day long and talk.  I miss that chica *^_^*  I definately could use a break and some quality time.  Have you ever realized that you want so badly to believe someone when they promise you something...but at the same time, you are so guarded that you can't believe them.  So, when they don't follow through, it's okay.  You're not too hurt because you kinda expected it all along.  *sigh*  *bleah*  Whatever...

       I still don't know where to go.  What can I say?  Eddie, just breathe...stop panicking and freaking out on me.  You shouldn't be so negative.  I don't know what else to say.  I admit that yes, I am scared.  And I will put everything else ahead of what I'm feeling.  I would rather deal with everything else than my own personal situations.  I would rather delve myself into work or school or anything else...as long as I don't have to deal with my personal sh*t.  I don't know how else to put it.  And in doing so, I fear that I will end up hurting people as I have done in the past.  I lag on dealing with my personal issues which does end up hurting people.  I care a great deal about this person.  When I am with this person, I'm always smiling...he's been there for me when I've needed him, but at the same time, my stupid fear comes along and I'm scared.  Maybe my actions seem like I'm pushing him away.  I fear hurting him, but I feel that I already have.  I can't be innocent again and just go along with things as if everything is okay.  I don't know how to describe it..  On the other hand, I'm so caught up in other stuff...that I want to care...but I find myself working myself doing so much other stuff that I'm so tired....

       A GLASS OF MILK    One day, a poor boy who was selling goods from door to door to pay his way through school, found he had only one thin dime left, and he was hungry. He decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal he asked for a drink of water. She thought he looked hungry so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly, and then asked, "How much do I owe you?" "You don't owe me anything," she replied. "Mother has taught us never to accept pay for a kindness. "He said..... "Then I thank you from my heart."   As Howard Kelly left that house, he not only felt stronger physically, but his faith in God and man was strong also. He had been ready to give up and quit.   Year's later that young woman became critically ill. The local doctors were baffled. They finally sent her to the big city, where they called in specialists to study her rare disease. Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation. When he heard the name of the town she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately he rose and wentdown the hall of the hospital to her room. Dressed in his doctor's gown he went in to see her. He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room determined to do his best to save her life. From that day he gave special  attention to the case.   After a long struggle, the battle was won. Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the edge and the bill was sent To  her room. She feared to open it, for she was sure it would take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally she looked, and something caught her attention on the side of the bill. She read these words..... "Paid in full with one glass of milk" (Signed) Dr. Howard Kelly.   Tears of joy flooded her eyes as her happy heart prayed: "Thank You, God, that Your love has spread abroad through human hearts and hands."

       I don't know where to begin...  I was so scared yesterday morning when Joe's mother called.  My mind was all in a whirlwind.  I could barely stand up and I felt dizzy and lightheaded. The shock factor still hasn't worn off.  I don't know...I really don't know.  What a tragedy.  My heart and prayers go out to all that have been affected.  I hope that you and your loved ones are safe tonight...I can't really sleep.  To my east coast sisters, especially Maryam and Sheetal...what a close call; I'm glad that you ladies are okay.  *hugz*  To Tracy, I'm still praying...I wish that I could say 'don't be scared' but I can't because I'm scared, too...but I have faith that God is looking out for all of us.   Gloria and Issay, thank you for your support and kind words in my moment of fear and panic.  Edward Thomas Wong, you had me soooo scared.  When I heard your voice, I started crying and you know it, too.  Just so much shock and concern...    As for what's been affecting me here on the west coast, Joe, I wish that I could take away your headache; you've been this amazing source of support and friendship to me.  Yesterday's phone call scared me....how we were woken up to be told about the WTC tragedy...the whole day was torture trying to figure out what was going on..now, you're being put on stand-by by the marine corps.  I don't know how to respond..just trying to be here for you.  *hugz*  Much love and support to all....all I can do is keep praying...*hugz*

       I wrote this three years ago and I still go back and remember the reasons behind it... Have you ever noticed that the worst way to miss someone is when they are right beside you and yet you can never have them... when the moment you can't feel them under your fingertips you miss them?  Have you ever wondered which hurts the most... saying something and wishing you had not, or saying nothing and wishing you had?  I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say...  They are the things you get ashamed of because words diminish them; words shrink things that seemed timeless when they were in your head... to no more than living size when they are brought out...    Don't be afraid to tell someone you love him.  If you do, he might break your heart... but if you don't, you might break his.  Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person?  Your heart decides who it likes and who it doesn't.  You can't tell your heart what to do.  It does it on its own when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.  Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?  Too many of us stay closed up because we are too afraid to care too much for the fear that the other person does not care as much, or at all.  Have you ever loved someone and they had absolutely no idea whatsoever?  Or fell for your best friend in the entire world, and then sat around and watch them fall for someone else?  Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?    We tell lies when we are afraid...afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us.  But every time we tell a lie... the things we fear grows stronger Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump Don't be a person who has to look back & wonder what they would have or could have had.  No one waits forever..   All of this makes me think back and I want to share a few quotes with you... 	I love you and not---not in a friendly way, although I think we're great friends. And not in a misplaced affection, puppy dog way, although I'm sure that's what you�ll call it. I love you. Very simple. Very truly. You are the---the epitome of everything I've ever looked for in another human being. And I know you think of me as just a friend and crossing that line is--is the furthest thing from an option you would ever consider but, huh, I had to say it. I just--I can't take this anymore. I can't stand next to you without wanting to hold you. I can't--I can't look into your eyes without feeling that longing you only read about in trashy romance novels. I can't talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are ... there isn't another soul on this fucking planet who has ever made me half the person I am when I'm with you."     Holden, Chasing Amy (I loved this part of the movie..*sigh*) - Love is when you care for someone even if there were no emotions. Passion or romance involved. You just love the person for who they are. Without that you would never know what true love is - Immature love says " I love you because I need you " but mature love says " I need you because I love you " - One of life�s disappointments includes meeting someone that meansthe world to you. But only to find that in the end it was never meant to be and you just have to let go �Letting go of someone you love is the hardest thing to do. It�s going to hurt and you�ll lose that someone but you�ll never lose your love for him or her. That love is endless �How beautiful is friendship that turns into love, but how painful is love that turns into friendship... �If it feels so good to love the wrong person, imagine how it would feel to love the right one. �Just because someone doesn�t love you the way you want them to doesn�t mean they don�t love you with all they have �Always tell a guy how you feel because you never know if he feels the same or not. It�s better to know than to hold onto something that isn�t real �Don�t cry because it�s over. Smile because it happened �if you run away from everything that scares you in life, youll be running forever �some things are better left unsaid �If you never make mistakes or your heart never breaks, then you�ll never know what true love takes �a journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step - Lao tzu � it hurts to love someone and not to be loved in return . but the most painful thing is to love someone and never having the courage to let them know how you feel �The only things in life that you regret are the risks that you never took  - Grumpy Old Men �Trouble is a part of your life, and if you don't share it, you don't give the person who loves you a chance to love you enough. - Never frown even if you are upset or angry b/c you never know when someone is going to fall in love with your smile...as long as he keeps smiling at me, my day can't get any better... - Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. Hope you find the one that makes you smile. ~ side note from Lady: "If I could hold a *star* for each time you  made me smile, I would have the whole evening *sky* in the palm of my hand" "Love is when the other person's happiness is more important than yours..." - We are each of us angels with only one wing, and we can only fly by embracing one another.- Luciano de Crescenzo  - Many things in life will catch your eye, but only a few will catch your heart.  - If you want to know what love is, give much of yourself.   Be honest. Be sincere. Be thoughtful. Be understanding. Be patient and still. Be ready to get hurt. - Sometimes you know in your heart you love someone, but you have to go away before your head can figure it out. - A friend will help you move.  A good friend will help you move a body. - "You don't love a woman because she is beautiful, but she is beautiful because you love her."  - "Nunc scio quit sit amor." Lat., "Now I know what love is."-Virgil  "Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength; loving someone deeply gives you courage."-Lao-Tzu - A baby is born with its hands clenched as if to say, "The world is mine, I shall take it."  A man dies with open hands as if to say, "I could take nothing with me." "We all dream; we do not understand our dreams, yet we act as if nothing strange goes on in our sleep minds, strange at least by comparison with the logical, purposeful doings of our minds when we are awake."

       It's been a long day...so tiring.  There was so much to do.  From church in the morning to moving out of Garden Courts.  That was such a frustrating move...thank you, Thoai and Alan for helping me.  Afterwards, Joy and I went for a Costco and Albertson's run...man, there's still so much more that we missed.  And that took up soo much time!  In between all that, I was busy unpacking my stuff.  And then, I came home to go out to dinner with Thoai, Jenn, Alan, Andrew, Rob, and Will.  Now, I just finished tidying up my room...  There is alot going through my head right now.  So tired and so frustrated.  I wish that I did have the answers to life.  Honestly...if I could duplicate myself, I would.  I would have one Donna that is her typical workaholic self who just keeps on going and smiling and making money.  By working herself with such crazy hours, she doesn't have to deal with reality.  I would have one Donna that is completely school oriented who just studies and reads and visits all of her professors.  A Donna who looks up their dissertations and then, discusses it with them.  I would have one Donna completely committed to alpha Kappa Delta Phi...love and friendship...  I would have one Donna who is trying to discover herself...religiously and personally..  I would have one Donna be happy with Eddie.  Gosh, Eddie, I do wish that I could make you happy but I can't do so right now.  =o(   I would have a Donna who is waiting...waiting for the right timing...  (here's something that just bugged the beejeebers out of me!) anon: yeah i remember talking to *sorority* anon: she said they only rush junior and seniors Lady Mamoru: *shrug* Lady Mamoru: dunno anon: they must has strong career goals anon: i think it might be like lawyer or doctor sor Lady Mamoru: that's not fair Lady Mamoru: does that mean that i don't have strong career goals?

Lady Mamoru: money means nothing anon: true that is what i told her Lady Mamoru: i want money...fine..with my hs diploma, i was making 4grand a month Lady Mamoru: but i dropped that to go to college and to follow my dreams.. anon: yeah true Lady Mamoru: i could say that my sat and act score was prolly one of the highest ones in my sorority and i have a really high gpa anon: cool Lady Mamoru: but because i don't dream to be one of those 'successful' asian careers anon: may i ask how high?

       I have been with many guys...cared about some...and loved rarely.  Sometimes, I got too scared to care for someone.  Sometimes, my fear was a hindrance in me telling that person how I truly felt.  And sometimes, my fear has caused me just to act and not feel.  I go through the motions of something but something inside of me just shuts down and I stop feeling.  I find it easier to delve myself into something else just to distract myself.  What's going through my head right now?  What if I lost my chance to tell someone how I care about him and I want him to have some hope.  I want to see him smile just as he always did when we were just being silly and goofing off.  I know that things aren't going well with him.  I know that he's scared and nervous about this whole tragedy.  His future...his life is on the line.  To save your world, you asked this man to die: Would this man, could he see you now, ask why? (Epitaph for an Unknown Soldier) -Wystan Hugh Auden  'The nation on maximum alert, President Bush approved the call-up of thousands of reservists and Congress rushed to post a $40 billion down payment Friday for a war on terrorism and the likes of Osama bin Laden....Administration officials said Bush had decided to authorize the call-up of as many as 50,000 members of the National Guard and Reserves. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld opened the Cabinet meeting with a prayer asking for ``patience to measure our lust for action, resolve to strengthen our obligation to lead, wisdom to illuminate our pursuit of justice and strength in defense of liberty.  Congress showed its resolve, the Senate voting 96-0 for the money to wage war on terrorism. House passage was delayed only until lawmakers could return to the Capitol from the prayer service at Washington National Cathedral. Congress also moved toward passage of a companion bill to endorse Bush`s still-emerging plans for a military response. The bill cleared the Senate 98-0, with a House vote set for Saturday'  I don't even know if he will read this.  I don't even know if I will see him again.  I don't even know where he is right now.  All that I do know is that he touched me.  He reached and touched my soul and built this trust between the two of us.  Any regrets?  Being selfish and scared...not knowing how to act around him.  Being silly and goofy when he probably needed me to be serious and understanding.  I miss him and his gentle understanding of things.  The way he considered how I felt and put me ahead of him.  The way that he sacrificed.  The way that he is sacrificing.  He is so brave.  His kind of courage is one that I truly admire.  I regret being so blind that I didn't see what he really needed.  He needed a friend and I was too blind...too naive to think otherwise.  I should have been more understanding.  And all of this makes me reflect back.  I've dated around...I've had boyfriends.  I've loved two of them...and the last one, I loved him but once a crack grew between the two of us, I began to back away.  And eventually, that love was lost to the winds.  All this reflection on my regrets in life.  I know that you should live life to its utmost.  But I still have my regrets.  I regret not fighting when I should have.  When I had every reason to fight, I don't...I don't want to be pushing myself onto anyone else.  I don't want to be forcing anything.  And who would I be fighting against?  The person that I care so strongly about?  I regret not telling the one I truly cared for that I'd wait for him no matter how long it took him.  I regret not having faith in myself.  I regret letting go so soon...I regret seeing the person that I cared about slip away and explore himself.  I regret not waiting for him.  I regret the fact that I couldn't be a true friend to him because I hurt so badly.  All these regrets...  And it makes me think...I was talking earlier to David Raleigh and he mentioned how he could never do my schedule.  And I realized that I have set up my schedule to be so busy that I don't have time to be with someone special.  Crazy, isn't it?  Stupid, more like it.  I don't have the time or energy really to devote into anyone right now or anytime soon.  So, why bother deluding myself that I can have someone special when in reality, I just can't fully handle it without coming across as a bad girlfriend.  blah blah blah...I'm going to stop rambling now cuz I'm not making any sense..

       I've been so caught up with my moving and other stuff that I lost track of the news.  Maybe that's what I really wanted...to lose track of reality and immerse myself in the bubble world where nothing goes wrong.  I just found out now that President Bush approved of taking up to 50,000 reservists.  Oh, gosh...Oh, goodness...I can't even say anything right now without wanting to cry even more...

       I can't explain anything..I have this huge knot in my throat and I have tears welling up in my eyes...  Moving sucks...I don't even care anymore about any of this.  There are much more important things out there to be concerned with.  I'm so stupid and selfish..

       I don't know where to even begin...   urlLink tornado...really worried about tim...  and then, there is  urlLink this link   Other than that, there is something that I need to blog about.  *sigh*  I think that I just made a decision that I know that I will look back upon and regret for the rest of my life.  Have you ever cared so much about someone but something inside of you was scared...and that fear enveloped all of you and made you so scared that you chose the chicken way out of things.  You chose to turn around and run away from your problems.  That's what happened to me.  I care so much about this person and want to be there for him.  I want to be patient and caring, but I'm scared.  Scared of getting hurt again.  I don't know what to think anymore.  It is true.  Sometimes, it isn't the person that hurt you the most that you end up regretting.  It is the person that you let go because you were scared, too scared to be with them.  I don't know.  I feel selfish though and I feel like a huge dork.  I keep on telling myself that I'm not going to cry and I bite back my tongue and try...I try to hold back my tears.  I don't know...I don't know if I can keep on talking/writing without wanting to cry some more..

       Annie, thank you for being here...it meant alot to me that you were here for me.  Words fail to describe the amazing bond of sisterhood that you have shown me always.  I don't know...right now, I just feel like walking away from everything...maybe just to clear my head.  So much going on and there's so much that I want to know or don't want to know.  *sigh*  I feel very...lost.

       My ethernet still isn't working and I should be working on my portfolio again but I just can't concentrate...  School started today...work started today.  It's set into action: 24 units...six upper-division courses and 15 hours a week at the writing department.  I've decided to decline the other internship I had for the Children's Center.  It would have been hella cool but honestly, I just can't fit that into my schedule right now.  It's all gonna be school, work, church, and kdphi kdphi kdphi until i die.  *^_^*

I lub you all!!  and to my pledge sisters, I love you guys even more...seeing them reminded me of everything that we've gone through together.  We can make it through everything and anything together, as long as we stand together.  To Eddie, heehee..Saturday was special despite the fact that neither one of us got what we sent the other person..thank you for putting up with me.  Thank you for everything, especially your patience and waiting.  My computer...ACK...it's been down and I'm so bummed because of it.  First, the ethernet woulnd't work and now, the video card won't work.  ACK!!  *bleah*  Now, i"m int he engineering computer labs working on this...I scanned in so many pix though!  Anyway, I still need to work on my portfolio...hmm...*^_^*  To my sisters, I'm excited about this upcoming weekend with the retreat.  I hope that you guys like what I have planned for us. Dearest Joseph, last night, seeing you so zonked out made me realize how much you mean to me and how much you do sacrifice for me.  =o(  I'm sorry that I don't appreciate you as much as I should.

       But on a different note, classes are pretty much occupying most of my time and then, there is the steadiness of working at the writing department.  I really enjoy my job there.  I enjoy the atmosphere and love working with the faculty, as well.  Then, there's aKDPhi...we've barely begun and I'm getting excited about this upcoming year.  My girlies..we've come a long way in one year.  Can you believe it?!???  *^_^*

       Wow...it has been a while since I last blogged.  I dunno...crazy busy schedule which is far from over.  *sigh*  So tired and my quarter has barely begun.  It's just that there is so much to do and I don't know where to begin.  It seems like when I start going, I just keep on going and there's so many things to handle...argh!  Right now, I'm back visiting the family to take care of some family ish.  Man, I rambled on so badly this morning during our drive to PV..I can't believe some of the things that I was saying.  Ugh...don't you hate it when you're sorta there.  I think that I might have caught something.  I'm getting all these icky headaches and feeling dizzy.  Sometimes, I'm slightly disoriented and my memory is fading..heehee, maybe I'm just getting old and stuff.  Well, if it wasn't for the nausea...anyway....I'm rambling again.  *bleah*

          "Sunset Path" To share with you a sunset, to symbolize the lack of light, where the day and night have met, and the sun takes flight.  Does that mean the sun has gone for you and me? The passion and burning hot warmth of sun Disappeared for the time to be, All options to be treies are done.  Is this the ending meant for all eternity, To say that the sun has set on us, And time for facing harsh reality, To follow Fate and to blindly trust?  Or can we turn this around, Think of the cooling moon in the black night, Stars shining upon a path newly formed Refusing to die without a fight?  Moon - constantly changing from whole to none, But always reuturning from time to time, Hardly realizing the cycle has just begun, Without understanding its reason or rhyme.  Which path will this sunset lead? Twisting and turning, blindly taking a step, Possibly to tears and my heart may bleed Or as much joy and comfort my heart could have kept.  Donna S. Wang (October 11, 2001)

       Gosh, I haven't been home in so long...just so busy with everything.  akdphi is taking up more and more of my time and I'm never really home for long.  So many long hours at the library or at friends' places.  So much stress....but good news also brings bad news...but there is something personal that I want to share...I think that I'm finally beginning to find solace in my writing again...I started to find my inspiration again...Through the tears and ashes, a phoenix will appear...

       Fate has an odd way of turning our lives around...and suddenly, you find your life flipped upside down and you're struggling to right yourself once again and swerve back onto its rightful path, fully aware of the fact that life is never going to be the same again..

       Oh, boy...I sprained my wrist and it sucks becase I can barely do anything.  ARGH..this weekend was definately something...just lots of ish..*bleah*  Andrew-babe and Stephen Mommy, thank you for dinner last night =oP  heehee..next year living might be something!  Anyway, there's alot on my mind.  Don't know what I should bring up and what I shouldn't.  Well, there's the war..I don't even know where to begin on that...Does that make any sense?  I'm trying to go about my daily living and stuff...but you can't ignore the fact that innocent people are living in a war ravaged country.  People are living in fear.  Do I fear my daily living?  To an extent but not really.  I'm ignorant and I hesitate alot lately.  I'm more and more cautious of what I say.  I just want to bury myself again.  KDPhi taught me something...it taught me to live a little.  It taught me that being a workaholic isn't worth it and I am only a college student once.  It taught me to cherish the little things and to open up, knowing that I will always have support wherever I go and whatever I do.  It showed me that I have sisters that care....  Meeting some of the friends that I have in college have also taught me alot.  It showed me how to be comfortable with who I am and to accept myself as who I am and to learn to deal with life.  I gotta stop running but at the same time, running away seems like the easiest solution.  I'm learning...  I almost ran away from a huge part of life, but thanks to someone, I saw the mistake that I was making.  I took a deep breath and turned around..admitted my mistake and am trying to handle the situation.  Today has been interesting so far.  For work, I was sent to be a substitute for a writing professor who called in sick for her Writing 50 course, research.  *^_^*  I have another class to teach at 11am...and then, I have my own classes.  It's so odd trying to teach/supervise my own peers or students older than myself.  In the meanwhile, there's just so much going on!!  I don't know where to begin talking...

       I mean, there has been the bonuses and the little things this week that has made me smile but at the same time, I still can't help being so frustrated...in case you didn't notice, the second poem that I wrote on the 16th..look at it carefully.  It is an acrostix...read down...the title for that poem is "Help"...wonder why?  =o�

       To be honest, it's been a rough week for me.  I don't really know where to begin or where to even end...all I know is that my long week is only going to end in a long weekend.  I wish that I could take some time apart from everything this weekend to just be.  To just be free and to just relax and rest up before my crazy week starts all over again.  I'm so tired and stressed.  Frustration seems to set in and I realized how my temper has been flaring up lately.  Scary thought but I actually got pretty upset with someone.  I got tired of it.  That's it.  I just got tired of it.  I'm not thinking anymore.  I feel like my reasoning has been pretty cloudy lately and I can't focus right now...argh!

       Okay, today in class, we were told to write a 4 line poem with 5 syllables per line and we weren't allowed 'k','h', and 'e' in it at all. So, here's what I wrote: Lost in foggy mist drops damp in dark air longing to find day craving simplicity  Anyway, that kinda inspired me to write some more...and here's what I came up with..  Dew glistening upon eyelashes, Blurring vision of reality Arms flailing around for support, Surround in the thick mist, Lost in the depths of a fog.  Blind to directions. Deaf to assistance. Mute to crying out.  Life's simplicity seems so far away Harder and harder to reach Final Destination Blocked by Emotion. ~ Donna S. Wang 10.16.01  Helplessness fills the mind Emptying of all reason and sense Lessening determination of hope Pouring confusion into each corner  Harder and harder to awaken Each daybreak begun with dread Levels of frustration building up Producing more desperation  Hands reaching out Escape from this craziness Lower me from this cliff Preferably before I fall  Hatred builds of the individual Enveloped with disappointment Leading to the ultimate creation Preparation of self-destruction ~ Donna S. Wang 10.16.01

       I got a lil' bro ~ woohoo!!  *^_^*  Heehee...but seriously, I'm pretty psyched about this.  He's so sweet and I really like him alot..just hope that I don't let him down through his pledging process.  I hope to be as encouraging and supportive as I possibly can.  The exchange yesterday turned out pretty well.  Seems like the guys enjoyed our home cooking *^_^*  And I picked up a lil' bro!!  I know, I know..I should stop saying that.  Today was definately one of those nice days.  I woke up this morning to a nice lil' surprise.  *smilez*  After that, I went off to church which I was late to *bleah* but the homily was pretty good.  And then, I gushed to Dwight about my new lil' bro..heehee..I know, I'm such a geek.  But I'm seriously pretty excited about this.  ANyway, I got to talk to my lil' bro on the phone and found out that he and his pledge bros were gonna go shopping for this Saturday's Lambda Bid Night.  I told him that I wanted to get a little something, so I ended up going with them.  I realized something when I was out with them.  They're so darn cute!!  =)  It reminded me of my pledgeship and how I kinda miss it.  I miss doing all the little things together and how close it brought us all.  I miss ish...lots of ish..  Anyway, they're just so cute!!  I'm totally rooting for our SB Lambdas' Psi pledge class..heehee  Anyway, after spending the afternoon with the guys, I had lots of studying and ish to catch up with back at home so I've been doing that.  I have just some random thoughts and ish..heehee..'ish' is my new word.  It encompasses the meaning of 'issues and stuff'.  =o)  Anyway, Dwight, it's been fun talking and I can hardly wait to head down there in a few weeks.  Hope you enjoyed your walk..even though you felt like an old man..it's okay, cuz I'm feeling old, too.  To our SLO aKDPhis, thank you soo much for coming down yesterday.  We loved the support and you guys looked so darn cute!!  heehee..the hats and feather boa definately did it plus that cake was *yummy*  Rocky, thank you for still being a friend to me despite all that has happened.  You still stand strong behind me and it's good to know that I have my pledge bro's support.  Matt, you're awesome..glad that you finally met my pledge sisters..it's about time, ya know?!?  j/k...To my lil' bro, Art, you prolly won't read this, but I'm super de duper excited about having you as my lil' bro and I promise that I'll try to be there every step of the way for ya!  To my pledge sisters, I love you strong lovely and eccentric ladies!!  I don't want to leave Santa Barbara because that will mean leaving you.  Being with you, I've learned alot...about myself..about you..about sisterhood..about forgiveness and trust...about US..*^_^*

       I'm so tired.  Someone, catch me.  =(  So stressed out from midterms and papers..*sigh*  Anyway, Dwight sent me this song and Grace gave the lyrics and I'm just listening to it now..I know, I know..I'm just so out it.  What am I supposed to do with all these blues Haunting me everywhere No matter what i do Watching the candle flicker out In the evening glow I can't let go, when will that night be over  Chorus: I didn't mean to fall in love with you And baby there's a name for what you put me through It isn't love it's robbery I'm sleeping with the ghost of you and me  Seen a lot of broken hearts go sailing by Phantom ships, lost at sea Well one of them is mine Raising my glass I sing a toast to the midnight sky I wonder why the stars don't seem to guide me (chorus repeated)  Bridge The ghost of you and me When will it set me free I hear the voices call Following footsteps down the hall Trying to save what's left of my heart and soul  Watching the candle flicker out in the evening glow I can't let go When will this night be over (chorus to fade out)

       Friend:   When you are sad, ...I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge against the sorry bastard who made you sad.   When you are blue, ...I'll try to dislodge whatever is choking you.   When you smile, ...I'll know you finally got laid.   When you are scared, ...I will rag you about it every chance I get.   When you are worried, ...I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and tell you to quit whining.  When you are confused, ...I will use little words to explain it to your dumb ass.   When you are sick, ...stay away from me until you're well again. I don't want whatever you have.   When you fall, ...I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass.   This is my oath, ...I pledge 'til the end.   Why you may ask? Because you're my friend!   P.S. A friend will help you move. A really good friend will help you move a body.

And ish...ish..ish...oh, man..around midnight, I was in tears and outside just walking in the mist...at 5am...I was running along in the rain...so frustrated and so tired.  Pouring rain fit my mode...*sigh*  I went into my midterm drenched and late...blah...got my paperwork done for the class...man..the midterm just sucked...I went in and tried to do it.  See, Joe, I did try...but 15 minutes later, I left the room in tears...I couldn't understand it.  Showed up to work soaking wet..and now?  Now, I have this huge project to do for the week...I think that I'll have to come in on my day off to finish up, too.  *sigh*

       "A part of you has grown in me. And so you see, it's you and me together forever and never apart, maybe in distance, but never in heart."  That's dedicated to my Genevive...the impact that you have left upon me..I shall never forget.  Saying goodbye has got to be the hardest thing to do.  When I look at you, I see this amazing future for one so young and so innocent.  But looking at you reminds me of the past and sometimes, the past needs to be let go.  You represent a time in my life where I felt so alone and you were my strength.  The fact that you needed me and depended on me so much.  I would be strong just for you.  I loved you when I thought that I had nothing left in me to love again.  I realize that if I hold onto you, I'm only being selfish and holding onto a memory..time to let go.  After all...love is sacrifice...

       Okay, enough of my silly ramblings and stories and poetry...  I want to share about my weekend.  *^_^*  Where should I begin?  To my e-board, I luv you guys and I luv how we hang out and discuss everything.  I think that it's wonderful *wink*  To my pledge bro, Matt, thank you...heehee..I know, you had to put up with 12 hours of me on the train to San Diego.  But it was definately worthwhile.  We now know who dominates in Big Two and we both had a good 'active' weekend.  *smilez*  I went to an exchange with the UCSD aKDPhi and the UCSD PAPhi.  Dwight, I know that I was supposed to chill with you and have a few beers, but I ended up hanging out with the girlies instead..sowee!  But Paula is so kick-@$$ and the girls are so great to be around...I kinda couldn't help it.  I just wanted to wish the Rho Pledge Class best of luck and much love...I hope to see you all on other side!  Despite everything, oh, yeah, Faustine and Kathy, thank you for keeping me company..but I have to admit one of the best parts of the evening was Stephanie's sudden surprise cop entrance.  =o�  Saturday's UCSD PAPhi Alpha/Beta Class Installs was definately something sweet.. Once again, congrats to you all...to my Big Bro, Arthur, *HUGZ*  Hope that you liked all of your gifts...I know that it's not much but just remember..it is the thought that counts!  And to Robert, my West H.S. buddy...we'll be talking later..but *HUGZ* thank you sooo much for going all to LA for a favor of mine.  In addition to that, hope that you like your gifts and put it to some good use...thanx for dropping me off at the salon to get my hair done, too.  heehee...we're such brats when we're together...from attacking each other..you know that I didn't beat yo sorry @$$ so you would still have some face in front of Lisa.  *^_^*  Oh, and thanx for the lil' mention of me in your program..it's nice to know that I talk so much on my cell phone that I'm going to give other ppl brain cancer..And thanx for taking the picture with me on your back.  I hope that you and your bros liked the 'pineapples' that we made for you guys.    thank you again to the ucsd kdphis for helping me out cuz there is no way in heck that i could have passed out gifts to all the guys and made it look all smooth and shiz.  Annie..my pledge sis and my president..heehee..you're so awesome!  I felt so much better once I saw you.  There's always something about a pledge sister, especially you, Bookworm!

       "Why We Write"   Imagine six million pictures at one moment. Then, imagine the thousand words that must go along with each picture. Everyone, no matter the age, status, religion, race, or gender, has a story to tell-- the story of their picture. If you just close your eyes for a moment, you won't draw a blank. Our lives are so full of wonderful pictures; we just need to tell them. That's why that dying captain trapped in the submarine wrote the letter to his wife. That's why those last occupants of the Warsaw Ghetto scribbled the words of their life onto scraps of paper, leaving those behind as their only momentos. The world is so caught up nowadays we don't bother to stop and tell each other our stories. We hurry along our busy lives, content to bustle around cities and pollute the air, because we don't care about the future, right? Everyone has their own story, why should they share? Why should they care enough to share? And that's where the writers come in. The writers of this world are needed to help us share our stories. How many of us have time to sit down and write a complete autobiography? How many of us actually remember all the details? How many of us want to remember the past? We all need some way to express our feelings, our emotions, our psyche. And it's not impossible to start. Pull out a sheet of paper. Turn on your computer. Write whatever comes to mind-- your day, your thoughts, your peeves, your joys, or your life in general. Gradually, we learn to tell our stories to others. We write to tell others our stories in such a way that makes us seem like real people. People who lived, breathed, then died. Not just names in a book. Not just bones in the ground. Living spirits that would've been long forgotten except for those lingering scraps of life-- our writing. Personally, I don't write so that I will be remembered. I write to vent. I write to express. I write to cleanse my soul. My blog is my catharsis. Whatever I write, I know I will be more of a person than a name to people. As colin once called it, "lightning" is what happens when you just start writing and it sweeps you along as you go, so that you don't realize what you've written until you've reached the end-- and then you're surprised at what you've written. I think writing is like that. Authors shouldn't write their books intentionally with symbols; great writers should write to express themselves and only have symbolism as a byproduct. That's the essence of truly great writing. (from grace..)

       It was always a hot summer  In the days we used to play  I could say it doesn't matter  But I'd give me all away  Now an autumn has passed and another one, too,  There will be many springs now,  All without you.  Our California winters won't see you again  And neither will I  Till my seasons will end  What hurts selfish me is not that you've gone,  But that I am still here,  And I'm all alone.  Spring, winter, fall run into each other  I hope where you are it is one endless summer.  In our hearts forever . . . till the end of time.  Waiting for the time we will be together again.   "Heaven's Tears" tonight, as the rain pours, drops fall from my eyes, selfishly missing you, it seems as though the heavens cry, the earthly loss of one so treasured, but the celestial gain of a precious soul Denial runs its course thru my mind; A knot clogged in my throat, strangling my cries and screams, Knowing but not fully accepting, the fact that you're gone: yesterday so beautiful, youthful, and vibrant, today - no longer here. I know the sun will rise and keep on shining through dismal clouds As a ray breaks past the gloom, I feel your presence and warmth; Living Forever and ever until the end of Time in our hearts and memories. Donna S. Wang 1-19-98 (during my acadec final)

       I saw you yesterday smiling and laughing through the pain. The sun was once shining, but now pours the heavy rain. But keep in constant mind the sun will rise again, A glorious rainbow will reappear And we'll forget about back then but keep you in our hearts forever and you'll live on and on We'll live lives to their fullest worth  [forwarded message]  this isn't the forward that I've been searching for, but it's just as important. If you have a forward that says something like, do you think a year is important, if not, then ask...but I know this is in there for sure, do you think an hour is important, if not, then ask two lovers waiting to meet...all I can remember is about the value of time....  Remember to always say what you mean. If you love someone, tell them. Don't be afraid to express yourself. Reach out and tell someone what they mean to you. Because when you decide that it is the right time,it might be too late. Seize the day. Carpe Diem. Never have regrets. Sometimes, you just have to either take the risk or the regret. And most importantly, stay close to your friends and family, for they have helped make you the person that you are today. Thank you guys so much...   Each life is a precious gift - a miracle, merging together of two wonderful people, Take it and live it. You only have one life . . . tell others that you love them; apreciate them; thank them...love them Oh, by the way, I love you for who you are.  Thank-you for being alive.  Thanx.

       "If I Had My Life To Live Over  I'd dare to make more mistakes next time.  I'd relax.  I would limber up.  I would be sillier than I have been this trip.  I would take fewer things seriously.  I would take more chances.  I would take more trips.  I would climb more mountains and swim more rivers.  I would eat more ice cream and less beans.  I would perhaps have more actual troubles but I'd have fewer imaginary ones.  You see, I'm one of those peole who live sensibly and sanely hour after hour,  day after day.  Oh, I've had my moments and if I had it to do over again, i"d have more of them.  In fact, I'd try to have nothing else.  Just moments.  One after another, instead of living so many years ahead of each day.  I've been one of those people who never go anywehre without a thermometer, a hot water bottle, a raincoat and a parachute.  If I had it to do again, I would travel lighter next time.  If I had my life to live over, I would start barefoot earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall.  I would go to more dances.  I would ride more merry-go-rounds.  I would pick more daisies."  {Nadine Stair (age 85)}

       Somebody I want somebody to share Share the rest of my life  Share my innermost thoughts Know my intimate details. Someone who'll stand by my side  and give me support and in return, she'll get my support She will listen to me  When I want to speak About the world we live in  and life in general.  Though my views may be torn They may even be perverted She'll hear me out  and won't easily be converted. That's my way of thinking  in fact she'll often disagree  But at the end of it all She will understand me. I want somebody who cares  for me passionately  with every thought  and with every breath Someone who'll help me see things In a different light All the things I detest  I will almost like. I don't want to be tied  To anyone's strings I'm carefully trying to stick clear Of those things  But when I'm asleep I want somebody  Who will put their arms around me  And kiss me tenderly.  Though things like this Make me sick In a case like this I'll get away with it. -Depeche Mode-

              Time is... money, or is not??         Imagine there is a bank which credits  your account each morning  with $86,400, carries over no balance from day to day, allows you to keep no cash balance, and every evening cancels whatever part of the amount you had failed to use during the day.  What would you do? Draw out every cent, of course!          Well, everyone has such a bank. Its name is time.         Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds. Every night it writes off, as lost, whatever of this you have failed to invest to good purpose. It carries over no balance. It allows no overdraft.  Each day it opens a new account for you. Each night it burns the records of the day. If you fail to use the day's deposits, the loss is yours.       There is no going back. There is no drawing against the "tomorrow".       You must live in the present on today's deposits. Invest it so as to get from it the upmost in health, happiness and success!          The clock is running. Make the most of today...          To realize the value of ONE YEAR       Ask a student who has failed his final exam.          To realize the value of ONE MONTH       Ask a mother who has given birth to a pre-mature baby.          To realize the value of ONE WEEK       Ask an editor of a weekly newspaper.          To realize the value of ONE DAY       Ask a daily wage laborer who has ten kids to feed.          To realize the value of ONE HOUR       Ask the lovers who are waiting to meet.          To realize the value of ONE MINUTE       Ask a person who has missed the train.          To realize the value of ONE SECOND       Ask a person who has survived an accident.          To realize the value of ONE MILLI-SECOND       Ask the person who has won a silver medal in the Olympics.          To find the value of ONE LIFETIME       Ask someone who missed their chance.          Treasure every moment that you have!          And treasure it more because you shared it with someone special...  Special enough to have your time... and remember, time waits for no one.         "We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give. "                                  ~     Winston Churchill

       The Bridge: A Modern Parable  There was once a big turntable bridge which spanned a large river. During most of the day, the bridge sat with the length running up and down the river parallel with the banks allowing ships to pass freely on both sides of the bridge. But, at certain times of the day, a certain train would come along and the bridge would be turned sideways across the river allowing the train to cross.   A switchman sat in a small shack on one side of the river where he operated the controls to turn the bridge and lock it into place when the train crossed. One evening when the switchman was waiting for the last train of the day to come, he looked off into the distance through the dimming twilight and caught sight of the train's light. He stepped to the controls and waited until the train was at a prescribed distance when he was to turn the bridge. He turned the bridge into position, but to his horror, he found that the locking control didn't work. If the bridge was not locked securely into position, it would wobble back and forth and the ends when the train came to it, causing the train to jump the track and go crashing into the river. This would be a passenger train with many people aboard.   He left the shack with the bridge turned across the river and hurried to the other side of the river where there was a lever which he could use to operate the lock manually. He could hear the rumble of the train now and leaned back- ward to apply his weight to it, locking the bridge. Many lives depended upon this man's strength.   Then, coming across the bridge from the other direction, he heard a sound that made his blood run cold. "Daddy, where are you?" His four-year-old son was crossing the bridge to look for him. His first instinct was to cry out to the child, "Run! Run!" But the train was too close. The tiny feet would never make it across the bridge in time. The man almost left the lever to run and snatch up his son and carry him to safety, but he realized he could not get back to the lever in time. Either the people on the train or his son must die. He took just a moment to make his decision.   The train sped swiftly and safely on its way and no one on board was even aware of the tiny, broken body thrown mercilessly into the river by the rushing train. Nor were they aware of the pitiful figure of a sobbing man still clinging tightly to the locking lever long after the train had passed.   They didn't see him walking home more slowly than he had ever walked to tell his wife how he had sacrificed their son.   Now, if you can comprehend the emotions which went through this man's heart, you can begin to understand the feelings of our Heavenly Father when He sacrificed His Son to bridge the gap between us and eternal life. Can there be any wonder that he caused the earth to tremble and the skies to darken when His Son died? And how does it feel when we speed along life without giving a thought to what was done for us through Jesus Christ? When was the last time you thanked Him for the sacrifice of His Son?   with tears streaming down my face....I thank the Lord... I found this to be extremely touching and just had to share this with you, too.

       A Relationship and the game of love is more or less like making a puzzle. The right timing is essential. Alot of mix and match involved. At time, when two pieces put together, it might be perfectly fit on the first try. Others, you need to put more effort on finding the right match. Though sometimes the pieces you had placed together fit right, but the color doesn`t match, or perhaps that the image makes out a pattern, but there are gaps on both edges. When all pieces are scattered everywhere, it might seem as if it is impossible to do it right. Leaving it aside or giving up may come across your mind, but deep down inside, you know you want to take this challenge and make everything right. Just be patient. Eventually when the last piece that is left put together, you know right a way that everything is worth waiting for.

       This only seems to get busier and busier...dang... *sigh*  Anyway, it was a good weekend, I guess.  But I just feel like it drained me so badly and I feel that it will continue to drain me.  *sigh*  The Friday exchange was alright..Fred, it was great hanging out with you again ~ brought back some memories of high school there.  Satuday, thank you, Dwight, for everything.  I enjoyed just walking around and talking about ish...Sunday, my soCal aKDPhi sisters...it was great seeing you all again!  *^_^*  To my pledge sisters, spending the weekend with you guys, I feel closer and it brought back memories of being wtih you all again.  Joe, I'm sorry that you're sick but with everything happening, I told you before about how I feel about everything.  I hope that you sincerely do take that into consideration.  i just don't want to follow in anyone else's footsteps and if anything, it is a cycle that needs to be broken.....

              The Choice    It's Quiet. It's early.  My coffee is hot.  The sky is still black. The world is still asleep.The day is coming.  In a few moments the day will arrive.  It will roar down the track of the rising of the sun.  The stillness of the dawn will be exchanged for the noise of the day.  The calm of solitude will be replaced by the pounding pace of the human race.  The refuge of the early morning will be invaded by decisions to be made and deadlines to be met.  For the next twelve hours I will be exposed to the day's demands.  It is now that I must make a choice.  Because of Calvary, I'm free to choose. And so I choose.  I choose love... No occasion justifies hatred; no injustice warrants bitterness.  I choose love.  Today I will love God and what God loves.  I choose joy... I will invite my God to be the God of circumstance.  I will refuse the temptation to be cynical... the tool of the lazy thinker.  I will refuse to see people as anything less than human beings, created by God.  I will refuse to see any problem as anything less than an opportunity to see God.  I choose peace... I will live forgiven.  I will forgive so that I may live.  I choose patience... I will overlook the inconveniences of the world.  Instead of cursing the One who takes my place, I'll invite him to do so.  rather than complain that the wait is too long, I will thank God for a moment to pray.  Instead of clinching my fist at new assignments, I will face them with joy and courage.I choose kindness... I will be kind to the poor, for they are alone.  Kind to the rich, for they are afraid.  And kind to the unkind, for such is how God has treated me.  I choose goodness... I will go without a dollar before I take a dishonest one.  I will be overlooked before I will boast.  I will confess before I will accuse.  I choose goodness.  I choose faithfulness... Today I will keep my promises.  My debtors will not regret their trust. My associates will not question my love.  And my children will never fear that their Father will not come home.I choose gentleness... Nothing is won by force. I choose to be gentle.  If I raise my voice may It be only in praise. If I clench my fist, may it be only in prayer.  If I make a demand, may It be only of myself.I choose self-control... I am a spiritual being.  After this body is dead, my spirit will soar. I refuse to let what will rot, rule the eternal.  I choose self-control.  I will be drunk only by joy. I will be impassioned only by my faith.  I will be influenced only by God.  I will be taught only by Christ. I choose self-control.  Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.  To these I commit my day.  If I succeed, I will give thanks.  If I fail, I will seek his grace.  And then, when this day is done, I will place my head on my pillow and rest.

       The odd thing is...sometimes, you just need a break from everything and everyone...I thought that I need that time to myself...funny thing is, when you're alone and trying to just be with yourself.  Sometimes, you think so much that you get moody because you realize that you don't know where you fit into the whole general pattern of life.  Sometimes, life just screws you over and you try to deal with it.  Sometimes, the past MUST remain in the past and it should NEVER be dug up.  Sometimes, you need to be strict and harsh in order for things to be taken seriously.  Sometimes, life is hard and it just happens.  Sometimes, you just cry because you hurt.  Accept it.  =o(

       I'm back...I'm back to my blogger.  I've missed it.  The simplicity of blogging...odd...isn't it?  I just want to share this...     I`ve laughed without you, I`ve smiled smiles without you, I`ve walked miles without you, I`ve experienced things unimaginable without you, I`ve seen the Orion without you, I`ve been lost without you, I've been hurt without you, I've had to be strong without you, I`ve been sick without you and even shed many tears without you....so what does this all mean? I can do everthing and anything all by myself! BUT, do I really want to do all this without you? Missing you like crazy....where are you?

       I wish that I could explain things..I wish that there was a simple explanation but there just isn't sometimes.  And sometimes, you just feel miserable.  I wish that I was over this little thing that happened on Christmas, but I'm not.  I'm still hurt by the whole thing of it.  And for some stupid reason, it brings tears to my eyes and I still choke up thinking about it.  Silly, isn't it?  But then again...if you didn't care, you wouldn't cry.

       This is going to be my last entry here in Blogger for quite some time. I don't know where to begin..ha...normal, isn't it? So much going on, too much going on. I need to simplify my life but where to begin?  Joe's getting deployed. He just got the call today. Who's Joe? Joe is my best friend here in Santa Barbara. We have a history together. We have a past together. We have been through thick and thin together. We have cried together and laughed together. He was my consolation and my escape many times over again.  Tears flowed unbidden from my eyes. I wish that I had spent more time with him this break instead being so caught up with other things. I wish that we had talked more often and left stupid little things in the past where they belonged. I wish that I could have been more understanding to him. I wish that I could have a better friend. I wish that I could have stopped running away from him.  Life isn't fair. Life never ceases to amaze me how it keeps on putting more and more hurdles in my path. My frustration level keeps on rising. I'm not going to lie. I feel so miserable right now. I feel like someone just punched a hole in my heart. I feel like someone just socked me and took away a part of me.  I feel sad.

       Today is my lil sis, Cindy's 10th birthday.  Where does the time go?  How does it fly by so quickly?  It seems like just yesterday she was this little thing that could barely walk and needed to hold onto my pinky.  It seems like time just keeps on going...and I know that I shouldn't dwell in the past.  This is now.  This is the present.  I have the future to look forward to.  I just got back from Midyear...Annie, thanx for putting up with me *^_^*  As if you don't put up with me enough..heehee..anyway, midyear was great.  Long meetings but overall, totally great.  Kinda made realize why I wanted to do kdphi and not any other sorority...seeing sisters from all over the country was bomb.  *^_^*  And it made me miss Chicago, too...

       I just need to vent.  Love is Sacrifice.  Always.... Sometimes, you care so much and sometimes, you have to let go.  Letting go is so hard...and sometimes, holding on is even harder.  When do you know when to let go and when to hold on?  No one can decide that but you.  Is it worth losing something incredible over something so small?  Or it is not so small and you're not being completely honest.  Sometimes, you'll look back and you'll regret what you did.  You'll regret how you never took that risk and tried to hold on.  Yeah, love is sacrifice but at the same time, it doesn't always mean to let go and sometimes you just have to learn it the hard way.  Just because love is sacrifice, it doesn't mean that you just give up.  That is not sacrifice.  Sacrifice is not giving up or quitting.  Sacrifice is an act out of love.  By giving up on someone...how is that an act out of love..it can be...but at the same time, you're not sacrificing.  You're being selfish and you're not willing to work things out.  You're not ready to truly sacrifice...  Sacrifice your pride.  Sacrifice your stubborn streak.  Sacrifice yourself to understand the other side.  Loving, knowing that you are going to get hurt is like living knowing that you are going to die.But not loving so you don't get hurt is like killing yourself before you die.  That is sacrifice.  Not giving up on something special.  That is not sacrifice when you did NOT even try...  Your destiny doesn�t pick you. You pick your destiny. Your destiny doesn�t come to you. You come to your destiny....is this the destiny that you want?  Because if it is, you better stop complaining.  Do not categorize anyone or judge anyone by a simple characteristic.  If you look at it from a third person point of view, she gave so much to you....she sacrificed so much for you.  She TRIED for you....she was honest and she was open.  She gave you everything that you asked for.  She put up with your ultimatums...and in the end, you did not respect her...her as a human being...her as being who she is...  She canNOT control how she is...how 'hyper-emotional' she is...that's just the way she is.  You told her once that you accepted her for who she was.  Emotions and all.    We don't see things as they are, we see things as we are....Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart ... Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens....Destiny is not a matter of chance.   It is a matter of choice: it is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved..  Whatever you want to do. Do it now. There are only so many tomorrows...  Fate only takes you so far. Once you get there its up to you to make it happen..Mistakes are not intended to down us rather they make us stronger..Are you weak?  Because I see you as a coward..one who ran from something that he feared...unwilling and unable to accept his fears.  I believe...When you love a person, you are giving him the power to hurt you....Love is having to see more than what meets the eyes...You never lose by loving. You always lose by holding back...Trust takes years to build but only takes seconds to destroy it...�	How beautiful is friendship that turns into love, but how painful is love that turns into friendship....Sometimes we stare so long at the door that is closing that we see too late the door that is open...Love comes and love goes. But if it was meant to be. Eventually it will come back and for sure you�ll know..Just because someone doesn�t love you the way you want them to doesn�t mean they don�t love you with all they have...Always tell a guy how you feel because you never know if he feels the same or not. It�s better to know than to hold onto something that isn�t real...  The love in your heart wasn�t put there to stay because love isn�t love until you give it away!  The way to love anything is to realize it might be lost.-G.K. Chesterton Audi partem alteram.(Hear the other side)-St. Augustine  It's what you do unthinking that makes the quick tear start. The tear may be forgotten but the hurt stays in the heart  if you run away from everything that scares you in life . you'll be running forever..I'm learning..I'm learning not to run away...I'm learning to stand up and face it.  As much as it hurts, I'm trying...I'm trying not to run away...can you say the same?  When you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself.  What isn't in us doesn't disturb us..love never dies . it just changes..  until a man has found something to die for . he is not fit to live  If you never make mistakes or your heart never breaks, then you�ll never know what true love takes...you'll never realize what true love is until you hurt...�a journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step..if you keep on running away...you'll never realize the truth, and it may be a long path before you'll be truly happy, but it does take one step.  At the same time, I still believe that you're running scared and you don't want to handle the possibility that you could get hurt...it hurts to love someone and not to be loved in return . but the most painful thing is to love someone and never having the courage to let them know how you feel...�The only things in life that you regret are the risks that you never took...  Trouble is a part of your life, and if you don't share it, you don't give the person who loves you a chance to love you enough..  once again, i'm going to share this... Have you ever noticed that the worst way to miss someone is when they are right beside you and yet you can never have them... when the moment you can't feel them under your fingertips you miss them?  Have you ever wondered which hurts the most... saying something and wishing you had not, or saying nothing and wishing you had?  I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say...  They are the things you get ashamed of because words diminish them; words shrink things that seemed timeless when they were in your head... to no more than living size when they are brought out...  Don't be afraid to tell someone you love him.  If you do, he might break your heart... but if you don't, you might break his.  Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person?    Your heart decides who it likes and who it doesn't.  You can't tell your heart what to do.  It does it on its own when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.  Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?  Too many of us stay closed up because we are too afraid to care too much for the fear that the other person does not care as much, or at all.  Have you ever loved someone and they had absolutely no idea whatsoever?  Or fell for your best friend in the entire world, and then sat around and watch them fall for someone else?  Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?  We tell lies when we are afraid...afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us.  But every time we tell a lie... the things we fear grows stronger   Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump.  Don't be a person who has to look back & wonder what they would have or could have had.  No one waits forever..  Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship...Take into account that great love and great achievements involve great risk..have you NOT learned anything from all of your accomplishments??  Or are you just scared to achieve a great love?  Open your arms to change, but don't let go of your values..Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer and sometimes, there is a reason for the silence...don't be so quick to judge that silence...In disagreements with loved ones, deal only with the current situation.  Don't bring up the past....Remember that the best relationship is one in which your love for each other exceeds your need for each other..Judge your success by what you had to give up in order to get it.  Love is when the other person's happiness is more important than yours...Don't be afraid to love, you have the memories forever...You know you're in love when the same person who makes you so happy can make you so mad..The first duty of love is to listen...The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, it must be felt with the HEART..We are each of us angels with only one wing, and we can only fly by embracing one another...Love is not losing freedom, it is sharing freedom with another..Life is a journey, and love is what makes that journey worthwhile...To love is to place our happiness in the happiness of another...Love is an act of endless forgiveness, a tender look which becomes a habit   In the degree that we love will we be loved..

       Here's some food for thought:  Have you ever found yourself falling for someone when you told yourself that you didn't want anything?  And this special person was such a surprise?  You never thought that you'd care so much in such a short time.  But you have and you are...and it scares the sh*t out of you.  You care so much and you know that because you care so much, this person has the power to hurt you so badly.  So, instead of letting them hurt you, you find a loophole and you run away... closing a door. You just shut a door. A door on something incredibly special. and you may regret it...but you're so d*mned in control that it doesn't matter or not anymore..

       when you love someone.. and they love you back... take care of it. don't act stupid. don't waste time. don't burden one another, but give each other equal love. there is such a thing as loving someone too much. protect yourself. and take each moment, each minute and cherish it. don't be too prideful to say i'm sorry. and if the best thing to do is the most painful.. do it quickly no matter how much it hurts. it will only hurt more later. the faster it's done, the sooner you can move on. and maybe if life is kind, it will offer you another chance. limit the pain. take care of the scars. and most importantly, learn from your mistakes and always find your smile., becuase you never do know who will fall in love with it.

       the decisions that will affect your life should be made by the person who knows you best - yourself....my biggest regret in life is never being strong enough for someone who was strong for me..and loved me for me...and cherished every waking moment with me...i can never put another through what i put that someone through again...

       1 Corinthians 13: 4-13  Love suffers long.  Love is kind; it is not jealous.  Love does not brag and is not puffed up; It does not behave unbecomingly and does not seek its own things; it is not provoked and does not take account of evil; It does not rejoice because of unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; It covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never falls away.  But whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless, or tongues, they will cease; or knowledge, it will be rendered useless. For we know in part, and we prophesy in party; But when that which is complete comes, that which is in part will be rendered useless. WHen I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought a child, I reasoned as a child; since I have become a man, I have done away with childish things. FOr now we see in a mirror obscurely, but at that time face to face, now I know in part, but at that time I will fully know even as also I was fully known. Now there abide faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.  *Life is the element of God; love is the expression of God as life.  Hence, GOd is love (1 John 4:16).  God as life is expressed in love.  All the fifteen virtues of love listed in vv. 4-7 are the divine virtues of God's life.  SUch a life differs fromt he outward gifts listed in ch.12.  THe Corinthians were pursuing the outward gifts, but they neglected love, the expression of GOd's life.  Hence, they were still fleshy, fleshly, or soulish (3:1, 3; 2:14)  THey needed to grow in life (expressed by their love in caring fot hte Body of Christ), pursuing love, not the outward gifts, that they might be spiritual (2:515).  THe totality of unrighteousness is Satan and the totality of truth is God.  Love as the expression of the divine life does not rejoice over Satan's unrighteousness but rejoices with God's truth.j  Love survives everything and holds its place forever.  It never fails, never fades out or comes to an end.  It is like the eternal life of God.  All the gifts, whether prophecies, or tongues, or knowledge, are means for God's operation, they are not life which expresses God.  Hence, they will cease and be rendered useless.  They are all dispensational.  Only life, which love expresses, is eternal.  According to the succeeding verses after verse 8, all gifts are for the immature child in this age.   They will all be rendered useless in the next age.  Only love is characteristic of a mature man and will last for eternity.  Hence, when we live and act by love, we have a foretaste of the next age and of eternity.  In verse 11, it can be interpreeted in how in the next age, the mature believers will become men, and all the childish gifts, especially those that are least - tongue-speaking and its interpretation - will be rendered useless.  However, we can have a foretaste of the next age by living a life of love in this age.  Love matures us in life; gifts keep us in childhood.  In the following verse, some say that what we see in a mirror is to see through a window.  THat is, through some medium which in degree, hinders vision.  THe word means also 'a mirror' but it is used for window, made, not of clear transparent glass, as now, but of semi-transparent materials.  FOr the final verse, Faith receives the divine things (John 1:12) and substantiates the spirtual and unseen things (Heb.11:1)  Hope reaps and partakes of the things substantiated by faith (Rom. 8:24-25)  Such love causes us to grow in life for the development and use of the spiritual gifts, and it is the most excellent way to have the greater gifts.  Hence, it is the greatest of the three abiding virtues.  SO we must pursue it (14:1)

       I'm listening to 3T's Anything and I miss my Bub.  *~Perhaps, after all, romance did not come into one's life with pomp and blare, like a gay knight riding down; Perhaps it crept to one's side like an old friend through quiet ways; Perhaps it revealed itself in seeming prose, until some sudden shaft of illumination flung athwart its pages betrayed the rhythm and the music; Perhaps...perhaps..love unfolded naturally out of a beautiful friendship, as a golden-hearted rose slipping from it's green sheath~*  *Anne of Avonlea*... Don't rush a romance...it will happen with time and patience.  Hearing from him this morning cheered me up but then, when I had to hear the content of what he said...that changed things.  Right now, everything seems different. When all is said and done, there will only be two phrases to sum up every relationship. The first is *forgive me* The second is *thank you* Say the first often in your youth, and you will need only the second on your deathbed.  I've realized that many quotes in relationships also apply to friendships.  But that's not the reason why I'm feeling so low.  Maybe it's cuz I"m sick and feeling pretty low.  Why is that?  WHy do we feel so sad when we're sick?  Why do we feel so out of it and not really there?  Loving, knowing that you are going to get hurt is like living knowing that you are going to die.  But not loving so you don't get hurt is like killing yourself before you die.  We're all going to die eventually...and getting hurt is a part of life...  �	"Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things thatyou didn�t do than by the ones you did do.   So throw off the bowlines.Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails.Explore. Dream. Discover." - Mark Twain  Things happen for a reason, right?  Sometimes, you have no control over fate.  And when bad news comes, it has a tendency to come in groups.    "Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things thatyou didn�t do than by the ones you did do.   So throw off the bowlines.Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails.Explore. Dream. Discover." - Mark Twain  THey say that you should say things to people before it's too late.   "Life will only come once, so make the most out of it." God didn't give us all things to enjoy life, but life to enjoy all things Mistakes are not intended to down us rather they make us stronger Each friend represents a world in us, a world not born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born God might not always answer you when you call. But whenever you need him he�s always on time  God promises skies. But he doesn�t promise they�ll always be blue When you have nothing left to say. Nothing left to do. Cry on. God understands your tears  God always answers our prayers. But sometimes the answer is no  Que signifie adieu, a moins de mourir?  Mais la mort serait-elle un adieu(What does farewell mean, if not death?  BUt will death itself be a farewell?)-Honore de Balzac  'Tis vain to struggle - let me perish young-Live as I lived, and love as I have loved;To dust if I return, from dust I sprung.-Lord George Gordon Byron

       Each one of us hides an awful secret.  Buried deep within every human soul throbs a muted pain that never goes away.  It is a lifelong yearning for that one love that will never be found, the languishing in our selves for an all-consuming intensity of intimacy that we know will never be fulfilled, a heart-need to surrender all tat we are to a bond that will never fail.  The silent churning at the core of our beings is the tormenting need to know and to be known, to understand and to be understood, to posses and to be possessed, to belong unconditionally and forever without fear of loss, betrayal or rejection.   Nothing is inherently annoying, yet you can choose to be annoyed by just about anything. Similarly, no situation is inherently embarrassing, or stressful, or frustrating. Embarrassment, stress, and frustration are some of the many ways in which you can choose to respond.  Keep in mind that your response to any situation is always your choice. After all, it`s you doing the responding. And it is in you best interest to choose wisely. Those who consistently respond with anger or envy, annoyance or frustration will reap the bitter rewards of those bitter responses. Yet when you choose to respond with understanding, with patience, with confidence and courage, the rewards will be far sweeter.   The situation does not determine the response. You determine your response. In every moment, in every circumstance, you can choose the response that will move your life positively forward. As such, nothing can bring you down unless you choose to be brought down. Nothing can annoy you, or frustrate you, or keep you dismayed.   You always have the choice to respond in the best and most positive way. Each time you choose your own positive, creative, empowering response, whatever the situation may be, you move yourself and the whole world forward.   -- Ralph Marston

       On a lonely night when the cold wind blows in the window,  I want to warm my frozen heart,  replaying that summer.  You look so happy playing on the beach,  A video of memories of just the two of us,  I view alone.  While feeling a little shy  I murmured "I love you",  your lying face is blurry  with the color of my tears.  I`m miserable over you! Sorry, but this way,  even now, I`m leaving behind my feelings.  If everything about us is in this light,  Can I still rewind, to that day?   Both hands full of memories I had believed,  I count them again and again, and yet  I get no further than my little finger.  Please be by my side, say "It`s not true!",  and embrace my heart.  If everything about us has disappeared,  Right now I want to rewind, to that day.   "We all want to fall in LOVE. Why? Because that experience makes us feel completely alive...Where every sense is heightened, every emotion is magnified, our every day reality is shattered and we are flying into the heavens. It may only last a moment, an hour, an afternoon. But that doesn't`t diminish its value. Because we are left with memories that we treasure for the rest of our lives." -Unknown   Some people come into our lives and quickly go. Some stay for a while and leave footprints in our hearts. And we are never, ever the same."   "The path of life has many crossroads, and at each one it`s difficult to say goodbye and go our own separate ways, choosing the direction that is right for each of us. But the memory of being together will always remain, and there is always the chance that our paths will cross again."   "The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart."   "We all take different paths in life, but no matter where we go, we take a little of each other everywhere."   I would like a simple life  yet all night I am laying  poems away in a long box.   --Anne Sexton   This is the hardest thing of all: to close the open hand out of love,  and keep modest as a giver.   --Nietzsche        "When you know the universal language, it's easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you, whether it's in the middle of the desert or in some great city. And when two such people encounter each other, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant. There is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world. Without such love, one's dreams would have no meaning." -Paulo Coelho         Be more concerned about your character  Than your reputation because your  Character is who you are and your  Reputation is what others think of you   �*:�.People are going to talk about you  Especially when they envy you  And the life you lived  Let them..  You affected their lives  They didn`t affect yours...�:*   Each new day is a blank page in the diary of your life.  The secret of success is in turning that diary into the best story you possibly can. Have pages on understanding and tales of overcoming hardships. Fill your story with enthusiasm, adventure, learning, and laughter. And make each chapter reflect time doing these things:  Follow your dreams. Work hard. Be kind. Do what you can to make the door open on a day that is filled with inspiration in some special way. Remember: Goodness will be rewarded. Smiles will pay you back. Have fun.  Find strength. Be truthful. Have faith. Don`t focus on anything you lack.  Realize that people are the treasures in life, and happiness is the real wealth. Have a diary that describes how you`re doing your best, and... the rest will take care of itself.  To The Friend I wish I had   I wish you saw me I as I wish I were  I made my mistakes As you did too  Though forgiveness is hard to give  I gave you the world with life  The pure gold of richness  In return you gave me sorrow  I see many obstacles to overcome  One so many that you are needed  Trying so much to have you here  You tend to disappear like thin air  Like the stars up above  You tend to be lost and bright  As I may run to find the light  You stand there watching me  Running and turning I fail  I fail to be guided towards you  I made my wrongs moving further  Further and further you get dim  Dimmer and Dimmer you are to me  As life is now starting a new  Though the precious gifts we receive  I shall cherish forever  So as you the lost friend  I shall one day go in search  Searching for a new path  Trying to head on back to your light  Of the friendship we once had  Til the end of day I shall know  I shall always know you are there  Somewhere in the skies  In search of a friend like me  Til we meet once again

       I've been living my life fine without you.  I've learned how to smile and laugh and make each and every day count as much as possible.  I treasure life fervently and even more than ever before.  I don't have time to hold grudges or to deal with them.  If someone cannot accept me or like me for me, then so be it.  I don't have the time for it.  The people that still do accept me and care for me for me, those are the ones that are worth spending my time with.  I've learned to deal with life without you but what I have learned...I miss you and I don't want to live my life without you.

       Another change...sorry.. XANGA now *^_^*  urlLink http://www.xanga.com/lady99   To my friends who are...single...   love is like a butterfly,  the more you chase it  the more it eludes you.  but if you just let it fly,  it will come to you when you least expect it.  love can make you happy and often it hurts,  but love's only special,  when you give it to someone who's really worth it.  so take your time and choose the best.   To my friends who are...not so single...   love isn't about becoming somebody else's  "perfect person"  its about finding someone  who helps you become the best person you can be.   To my friends who are...playboy/girl types...   never say "I love you" if you don't care.  never talk about feelings  if they aren't really there.  never touch a life if you mean to break a heart.  never say you will, if you don't plan to start.  never look in the eye when all you do is lie.  the most cruel thing a guy can do to a girl is to let her fall in love  when he doesn't intend to catch her fall  ...and it works both ways...   To my friends who are...married...   love is not about "its your fault",  but "I'm sorry",  not "where are you",  but "I'm right here",  not "how could you",  but "I understand",  not "I wish you were",  but "I'm thankful you are".   To my friends who are...engaged...   the true measure of compatibility is not the years spent  together  but how good you are for each other.   To my friends who are...heartbroken...   heartbreaks last as long as you want  and cuts as deep as you allow them to go.  the challenge is not how to survive heartbreaks  but to learn from them.   To my friends who are...naive...   how to be in love:  fall but don't stumble,  be consistent but not too persistent,  share and never be unfair,  understand and try not to demand and get hurt,  but never keep the pain.   To my friends who are...possessive...   it breaks your heart to see the one you love happy with someone else  but it's more painful to know that the one you love is unhappy with you.   To my friends who are...afraid to confess...   love hurts when you break up with someone,  it hurts even more when someone breaks up with you,  but love hurts the most when the person you love has no idea how you feel.   To my friends who are...still holding on...   a sad thing about life is when you meet someone and fall in love  only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be  and that you have wasted years on someone who wasn't worth it  if he isn't worth it now, he's not going to be worth it a year  or 10 years from now.  let go...   To all my friends...   my wish for you is a man/woman whose love is   honest  strong  mature  never-changing  uplifting  protective  encouraging  rewarding  and unselfish   "as long as we have memories,  yesterday remains.  as long as we have hope,  tomorrow awaits.  as long as we have friendship,  each day is never a waste..."   friends can be like stars,  you can't always see them,  but you know they're there.  have great hopes  and dare to go  all out for them  have great dreams and dare to live them.  have great expectations and believe in them.

       Yeah, a month has gone by and I'm just using xanga now...that's it.  Convention has come and flown by.  My active kdphi life is over and I'm almost officially an alumnae.  And I've stepped down from my position.  All that I have this summer is my boyfriend, my girls, and school.  I am looking so forward to that...

       wow - it has been even longer since I've posted here..yeah, I use my xanga for most stuff and another function for my more personal thoughts...  updates.. I have two beautiful lil sisters in our Alpha Class at UCSB - Junko Kurata, Alpha #17 aka my Furby and Magdalena (Maggie) Ann LaBranch, Alpha #18 aka my Fob.  I have moved back to Chi-town  I have beeen nominated to National Alumnae Board for kdphi  I have another lil bro, Andy Lam, UMass, Amherst Charter #10 aka Knockout  I have another lil sis - my baby, Vicky Whang, UMCP charter #12 Pledge *Happy 20th Bday, my baby*  My boyfriend and I broke up and for ONCE..in a long time, I am alone by choice...because I messed up so much before..getting involved before I was ready.  It's been 5 months of being alone and you know what?  I'm fine with that and I prefer it because I need to figure out alot of things on my own before messing someone else's life up...  I'm working at http://www.ncsasports.org My career has taken a path that I would have never expected to take...  and I'm fine with that  just rolling with the punches  and I still want to go to grad school - but not for another year or two...must save money and help out the family  Cuz family is family....

       More updates...wow, day after Christmas.  My boyfriend and I recently celebrated our one year anniversary - yay!  :)  But Christmas was wonderful being able to spend it with him...that's all that counts...even since my last blog, even more has changed.  I changed jobs - that is one big thing...after a year and a month at NCSA, I quit.  I've been working at PCOM ever since I quit NCSA and have been very happy.  My charter lil dped - what else is new...and my legacy dped - not much is new either..and my two grand lils at ucsb dped - adding to the tradition....BUT one of my lil sis did cross a charter lil sis so I am a charter grand big - yay!  National Alumnae Board still does take up a lot of my time but I'm learning how to handle it better and better.  I'm learning how to compromise kdphi and my life, which is always a good thing.  :)  Other than that..life is going well...moving along and I can't really complain..I mean, I could complain but it's not really worth it.  So, here's to 2003 and looking forward to 2004!

       Sometimes, I get so frustrated and I let my actions show it.  Definately not a good way to start the new year.  Sometimes, I let little things bother me and then, I keep them inside and don't confront them just because I don't want to be overeacting over every little thing.  Then, it just kinda implodes or explodes.  I didn't have anything to say last night because if I said anything, it wouldn't have been so nice...so I chose to be silent.  :(

       New Years 2003-2004 was great...  Gina and Lisa (my elementary school buddies came over)...Tracey, Bindu, and Kuan helped me set up our beds and stuff...Joe (NYU), Brian (nephew from NU), and Connie dropped for a little bit and Sal eventually showed up.  :)  Just some movies and alchy and some horns, too..simple and sweet and nice.  New years resolutions? I usually hate making these online cuz when I fail, I feel miserable  1.  Lose the 15lbs that I've gained since graduation (or rather, since the Alphas) 2.  Save up enough money for a down payment on my condo 3.  Pay off 50% of medical debt 4.  UCSB *wink* 5.  Alumnae 2nd Annual Convention 6.  Get my Massage Diploma 7.  July 4, 2004 8.  Charters' Annual Trip 9.  December 18, 2004 *wink* 10.  Finish with my 10 cent wing search 11.  Trips to East Coast, Texas, California, and of course, Midwest ;-)

       Sometimes, you just need to escape or you just need to vent...right now, I need to do both and right now, I have that desire to run....  And running I'm about to do right now....I need to talk to someone right now and I need to get away because there's just some things in life that you can't count on.  :(

       I feel so negative...all this negativity...all this frustration.  I need to let it all out before I end up exploding again.  I want all of this settled and I wish that I knew what was wrong with me.  I wish that I could be happy and sociable and ME again.  I love making people smile...love making them laugh.  And right now, I feel so blah and I don't want anyone that I'm like this right now.   I wish that I could just hide underneath my covers and not come out for a while - go into hibernation.  Where did I go so wrong?  What did I not do right?  My intentions were real and true...and I feel like sinking into this black hole.  I feel so wrong...so wrong that I cannot be there for my family and all this bullshit that is going on.  When things get hard and tough, you're supposed to be there for each other, not run away.  And I'm forever running...

       Some things never change....I used to go out running when things got to me.  Why can't i do that now?  Nowadays, I'm weak...I just let it fester and build up.  Three years ago, I worried about my health, money, and my family.  Now, it's mostly all about money and family.  And somehow, those two have combined into one big concern.  I'm tired of worrying about my mother and her spending problems now.  I'm tired of how everything is changing and nothing will ever be the same.  I hate it when people lecture me about this and that.  Someone told me that I should break up with Kuan because of religion.  Religion means nothing to me anymore...and I've changed in that aspect and if you cannot accept that, then, you are not worthy of my friendship.  Things change and it is my life.  let me take care of it the way that I want to.  I am happy with Kuan - happier than I have ever been with a guy for this long if that makes any sense.  Isn't that supposed to be what matters?  My happiness.  It seems like that doesn't seem to matter anymore.... security...stability...safety...all add to my happiness....  And to the people that it should matter to, especially at my mother...none of that matters.

       As much as I like xanga - too many people know about xanga and so, it's back to the blogger for me.  :-)  It's Monday morning and I'm back at work....and as usual, L. has me annoyed but I'm in a cheery mood so I refuse to let him ruin that for me.  I'm incredibly sleepy - I couldn't sleep until 2:30am...and kept on waking up- I had some weird dreams...got really hot and then, really cold...and I moved my clock to the upstairs bedroom so I had no real sense of time.  Blah.  So, all that is left to move is Samera's bed downstairs and then, my bed upstairs.  I'm trying to figure out what's the best way to move stuff - should we take apart her bed first and move it downstairs and then, take apart my bed and move it upstairs?  Or should we take apart mine first.  Mine has less stuff to take apart, etc.  What a Monday..I feel like i have this huge list of things to do!  My biggest thing is that I need to hit up BankOne and deposit a check and get a cashier's check for my rent and then, sit in for an Educational loan for school.  Man, classes for me start next Monday..one more week and then, I'm a student again.  Wish me luck!

       So, I'm annoyed...at the world.  Why can't anything work out?  Like work, personal, and kdphi just somehow fit together...why does all THREE have to fall on the same weekend?  WTF?!  It just doesn't make any sense and it makes me sad.  :(  I want all three but instead, I have to prioritize.

       I'm mad...I'm sincerely annoyed now.  I'm not a materialistic person but this has got to stop.  I just found out that Grace got Christmas presents from my parents..I haven't gotten Christmas presents from them since I was in junior high...and I even sent gifts home...this really sucks...I don't want to talk about it...and the financial arguements that I get in with my mother...and how I'm a 'bad' daughter...even though I send money home and I try to help out as much as I can..

       oh gosh...  I feel so horrible right now.  My phone bill has been skyrocketing lately and I'm not sure where to really cut down.  It was really high in November because I was talking a lot with an old friend who was going through some troubled times...and it went up in December because I was just stupid and wasn't aware of my minutes...and now, I have this $500 phone bill...and they disconnected me last night.  Which I was completely unaware of and I thought that my boyfriend was just taking a break and was having one of his nights out since he said that he'd call me later but he didn't.  It turns out that he did try calling me like 4/5 times but it said that my phone was disconnected; shortly after I went to bed, he called up my roommate.  And then, this morning, I really had to use my cell phone..so what happens?  Sheesh...I had to pay off all $500 of the phone bill which has me freaking nervous cuz I have a bill that is going to come through on the 21st of January and that's the day before my payday.  :(  I'll just have to call them up and see if they can pull the check out on the 22nd, instead.  *sigh*  Life is one big whirlwind and I hate how money can affect so many of our lives.  I hate how money always manages to run life...how much you can enjoy it..how much you can hate for it...about it...stressing about needing more money...working your butt off to get more...and hurting...cuz you don't have enough.

       Here's a wing update from the wingman Kuan and me... Gamekeepers (Armitage & Lincoln): Thursdays 10 cents wings Overall Rating from Donna: 9     Overall Rating from Kuan: 9.5 When we first got there, we were slightly thrown off the emptiness of the place (but it was also ten degrees below and snowing) but the waitress was super nice and she was at every beck and call.  The setup was very sports bar like.  Just lots of bar space and setup - Kuan and I sat at a small table and ordered their cajun fries smothered with cheese.  There was no drink minimum (woohoo) and they had FOUR types of wings - homemade BBQ, mild, hot, and d*mn hot!  ;-)  Since I have such a low tolerance for spicy stuff, we ordered a dozen bbq and dozen mild.  We also got a pitcher of michelob ultra (ya know - low carbs and calories!) FOR ONLY $7.  FOOD was a 10+++  The wings were bigger than even McGees and they were DELISH which also included a side of celery and carrots, too.  Their ranch was a little sweet but still really good.  They gave us a LOT of fries, too.  Surprisingly enough, the 24 wings was enough for the two of us.  (Hey, $2.40 - not bad at all)  So, current rankings: Monday nights: Hawkeyes (Donna: 7.4 and Kuan: 9) Tuesday nights: McGees (Donna: 8  and Kuan 7.5)  Wednesday nights: Kelly's Pub (Donna: 4.4  and Kuan: 5)  Thursday nights: Gamekeepers (Donna: 9  and Kuan: 9.5)

       I am on fire today...nothing can stop me at work.  I had three interviews - three very successful interviews.  The second and third were a HUGE surprise...I was only expecting one person but she brought her twin sister in and next thing I know, they're signing up and registering for classes - hot diggidity!  haha..I know - I'm one big dork.  Oh, and I got my shampoo and conditioner on sale - it's so dorky.  Kuan and I both use the same shampoo/conditioner - Garnier Fructise.  *^_^*  I just feel very accomplished and super excited - I get to see my boyfriend tonight.  I feel so giddy and excited about seeing him.  Is that possible?  After a year to still feel this way?  To still be so excited to see him?  I studied and did my homework for two hours last night - I feel like a studious little girl.  However, I still have my anatomy homework to do tonight...so after the beer and wings and the movie and some quality loving time with the boyfriend, I need to do my anatomy homework.  :-P  Okay, now for some kdphi time...  btw - February 6-8 weekend is going to be AWESOME...more on that later ;-)  Just a quick update...pics to follow... Midyear in Houston 2004 was pretty awesome...it was really good seeing old faces and meeting new ones, as well.  It's amazing how we share so much love for our letters.  :-)  National Alumnae Board was incredibly productive and it amazes me how much we're growing and progressing!!  To my SB girls - Don, Angela, and Kristin - it is ALWAYS good to see you girls; I miss you more and more but I knowt hat we're growing up....my spring 2k1 pledge sis - so good to be around y'all - Tammy, Chihae, Kris & Don, Julie, Raquel, Kat, and more!  to National Board - Yasmeen - congrats again, and Sher, Petra, Trang, Hanh, Suki, and everyone else!  I'd go more into names for the rest of all the faces that I saw (UMCP, Buffalo, FSU, Baylor, NYU, SoCal, NorCal, and all the other schools) but I don't want to bore everyone....it's always good to have a great KDPhi filled weekend.  I just realized that I didn't talk or meet any guys except for Danny (spring '01 CHARTER)....sorry - too busy trying to keep up with kdphis!  I came back on Sunday to meet up with Chris (UIUC), Frank and Jon (JHU) for some Joy Yees and then, out to Second City and then, this morning, the guys had to leave my place around 4ish in the morning just to catch their flight...and now, work until 6pm and then, class from 6-9:30pm...btw - CONGRATS to UC San Diego's Phi Class - especially to Momma Jen and all the big sisters!!  :-)

       Okay...recap: Friday: CONGRATS to UCSB aKDPhi's Gamma class - Christine & Jessica headed off to Midway airport to meet up with Tessa and yvonne and we watched First Knight on our way to Houston...(pic coming soon)...got picked up by Michelle & Nette...at the hotel, we picked up Don and then, we went off to the Lambda/KDPhi mixer at the chinese buffet place...met up with Tammy..the alumnae felt old and weird when little 18 year old Lambdas tried to meet us.  Saw Julie & Danny (yay spring 2k1)..went back to the hotel - greasy Chinese food gave me a headache...met up with Kristin and Angela..they were starving and tired (luckily Kuan was able to help us find a food delivery place via the internet) and ordered some more food...but then, Ang's room was bombarded by Lambdas so she came over to crash...  Saturday: meetings...more meetings...business...business...brief intro into the actives meeting..more meetings and business...dinner at this delish South American place and they had yummy mojitos!!  :)  And then, bonding time with Nette and then, to this club called Go.  :-)  Spring 2k1 shots with Chihae and Don.  More drinks with National Board..heehee...and dancing around with Diana, SoCal KDPhis, UIC, Tessa, Petra, and everyone else...basically a very KDPhi filled weekend (no boys since I already have Kuan and everyone else seems to pale in comparison) but fun stuff...  Sunday: flying out...being soo freaking tired...meeting up with Chris, Frank, and Jon at Joy Yees and got them addicteed to the boba there..heehee...and then, off to Second City (but Donna with very little sleep...I started nodding off during the improv *sigh*) and then, back home..home sweet home  Today: woke up at 4ish in the morning to walk Frank and Jon to the blue line - thank goodness they made their flight!  Even tho Jon scared the crap out of me and forgot his wallet!  Anyway...now, I'm at work and then, I have class tonight from 6-9:30pm...*sigh*....I'm so tired.

       Yeah..I miss my Dad... and my siblings...Grace, Cindy, and Steve.. I miss my girls...I really really miss Donna, Annie, and Jin - the trio that knows me best...from drinking at 2am to stressing out together to being the ones that I'll call in a heartbeat when I need to talk and share news with. I miss my HS buddies...my Andrew babe and all his silliness...Leo and his forever girl-craziness...Stephen Mommy and him just being "maternal"...and of course, my Bert Buddy for just being him...  People say that I'm too social sometimes and thing is...I love meeting new people and I'll forever be friendly but these people are the ones that I cherish so close to my heart because they are kindred spirits..friends first...before any title.

       I came really close to crying today...I teared up - that doesn't count, right?  This day only seems to get worse and worse sometimes...  I'm taking off of work early to focus and clear my head and my eyes.  We talked about stuff and cleared stuff up but it also made me realize other things.

       I don't know what it is...  Perhaps it's the fact that when I really needed to talk to someone, you were on the phone with someone else and you ignored my call...luckily, my best friend came through for me and listened to me cry and comforted me.  And when sh*t went through again, I tried calling you and it just kept on ringing and ringing.  And almost miraculously my best friend calls me to check up on me...and he already knew what the hell was going on so it was okay for me to vent and rant to him.  And by the time you call me back, I don't want to talk about it anymore...and besides, it's not like you know or knew what was bothering me.  And I didn't feel like explaining and getting all emotional again.  And when I sit on the phone with tears just running down my face, you couldn't cheer me up and when you said that you wanted to cheer me up, I couldn't smile.  The tears just kinda ran faster....and now, I guess that this is just a problem that I don't want to share anymore.  Just because I don't want to talk about it anymore - I just want to fucking deal with it.  And it's not you...I'm not blaming you for anything.  It's just bad timing.  Perhaps, it is that you're suddenly more willing to make time for me.  When before, when I wanted to spend time with you and I was willing to change my schedule around for you, sometimes, it felt like I was pulling teeth.  And sometimes, you said that you felt smothered.  And to be honest, yes, I did feel like I was being taken for granted.  I feel it even more now...when my schedule allows for very little flexibility and every free moment I have, it's somehow being taken up and when I cancel on you - it's not you.  It's just that I need time for me.  When the fuck am I going to have time for me???  I need to study and do my homework and manage to fit that into my own me time.  I have time for work - my 40-50 hours a week, my time for school - my 10 hours a week plus study and practice and homework time, my time for kdphi - who knows how long it takes me...and I always make time for you.  I'm tired...I'm exhausted and just want a break...from life, in general.  I like what I do..I like what I study but I'm tired.

       So, it's Chinese New Year...new year means new resolutions and new beginnings...  I wish that it could be that way but I know that it won't be.  Old problems won't die unless resolved.  And some problems just won't die out.  I'm tired....I'm so freaking tired of the same old bullsh*t.  I won't cry because he said that if I cry on Chinese New Year, I'll be crying all year long.  Damn it.  I wish that I wasn't so emotional and I could just let everything slide off...  On a side note, guys don't change.  They always want what they can't have.  They always seem to not appreciate what they originally had and then, when the situation changes, they then start wanting that they used to have....sucks being taken for granted, huh?

       Okay...so my office gets pho from our COO cuz we're doing such a good job plus it's freaking cold outside!!  (Try negative five degrees plus windchill)  Anyway, L. and M. are married and always have lunch together...  M. comes in and starts to berate L. for not ordering an extra bowl of pho for her...and the COO comes by and apologizes cuz she didn't know that M. was going to be working cuz M. didn't show up Monday or Tuesday to work...anyway, M. goes out of the office in a huff and L. is like "oh, well..I'm hungry" so he starts to eat his beef pho which btw is great bc of this weather..and free food is always a plus.  Anyway, 10 minutes later, M. comes back in with a bowl and L. has already scarfed down everything... M: "You ate all of it?  You pig!  You were supposed to share with me!" L: "You never said that you wanted any.  Now, don't start giving me attitude"  And hence, the drama ensues...I must hurry because I have an appointment at 1pm but this drama is needless and lame.

       I'm awake...in cold sweat and shaking.....I had this nightmare...or I dunno what you'd call it..  I dreamt that I was some kind of engineer and we were busy doing research with these three monsters - really intelligent but if anyone was contaminated, they were supposed to be killed by these monsters.  These monsters produced this incredible amount of energy that could support the whole world and for some reason, they trusted me but even so, I had to be really careful around them and the other engineers noticed that they trusted me..so they started running trust tests by placing me inside of a plastic tubing and etc...anyway, I dreamt that Kuan had a visitor come into town and he wanted me to be around to go out and stuff but work was being really demanding.  I guess that there was some weekened thing going on and I couldn't go so I told him to take his friend and he said that he'd stop by afterwards and show his friend my workplace since he had a key to the building.   So, I'm busy losing sleep over these monsters...or creatures, rather.  Discovering that you can communicate with them and they do undersand humans.  And when they stare at you, you feel this tingling sensation that they can read your mind and your inner fears....  Anyway, I'm falling asleep and suddenly, I feel this huge jolt of electricity waking me up and sirens are going off - I guess that there has been some trespassers and now, for some reason these creatures are ready to attack them.  I ran down five flights of stairs and when I slam open the door - one of the creatures is poised over Kuan and this chick - she's incredibly drunk and he's just staring up in shock.  And for some reason, I start crying....and I slowly walk over there and I touch the creature feeling all this energy pulsing through me and I say "I've been contaminated - if you spare these two, you can take me" And suddenly I feel this overwhelming sensation of heat and I'm looking into the creature's eyes and she sends me messages of pity.  Then, I collapse and when I wake up, I'm alone...I wander around the hospital corridors freezing...and I find Kuan and the first thing that I ask him "Did you kiss her?"  And he nods..  and I start to cry...and I tell him that it's over and for some reason, it feels like the creature is in my head...telling me how this other girl replaced me.  And I just got too busy for him.  It wasn't fair...how when he needed me, I was there...through all of his down and low points.  Through all of his times of insecurity and frustration, I stood by his side and suddenly, when I needed him to be there and be understanding, he didn't reciprocate.  And maybe it is my insecurity that I can't seem to hold onto a guy and he always manages to seek solace with someone else.  I felt this overwhelming sensation of sadness...all of my sacrifices meant nothing to him.....and I found myself walking away from him forever...  Then, I woke up in cold sweat, shaking....and now...and now, I'm still shaking.  EDIT: yeah, that was at 5am...and now, I'm at work and the more I think about it...I think that they were white dragons...wormlike..  And I went back to sleep and I dreamed about another guy...really weird - it was like a sequel too that dream....i'm just really weirded out now.

       To My Friends Who Are...........SINGLE               Love is like a butterfly. The more you chase it, the more it eludes you. But if you just let it fly, it will come to you when you least expect it.  Love can make you happy but often it hurts, but love's only special when you give it to someone who is really worth it. So take your time and choose the best. To My Friends Who Are............NOT SO SINGLE               Love isn't about becoming somebody else's "perfect person." It's about finding someone who helps you become the best person you can be. To My Friends Who Are............PLAYBOY/GIRL TYPE               Never say "I love you" if you don't care. Never talk about feelings if they aren't there. Never touch a life if you mean to break a heart. Never look in the eye when all you do is lie. The cruelest thing a guy can do to a girl is to let her fall in love when he doesn't intend to catch her fall and it works both ways... To My Friends Who Are............MARRIED               Love is not about "it's your fault", but "I'm sorry." Not "where are you", but "I'm right here." Not "how could you", but "I understand." Not "I wish you were", but "I'm thankful you are." To My Friends Who Are............ENGAGED               The true measure of compatibility is not the years spent together but how good you are for each other. To My Friends Who Are............HEARTBROKEN               Heartbreaks last as long as you want and cut as deep as you allow them to go. The challenge is not how to survive heartbreaks but to learn from them. To My Friends Who Are............NAIVE               How to be in love: Fall but don't stumble, be consistent but not too persistent, share and never be unfair, understand and try not to demand, and get hurt but never keep the pain. To My Friends Who Are............POSSESSIVE               It breaks your heart to see the one you love happy with someone else but it's more painful to know that the one you love is unhappy with you. To My Friends Who Are............AFRAID TO CONFESS               Love hurts when you break up with someone. It hurts even more when someone breaks up with you. But love hurts the most when the person you love has no idea how you feel. To My Friends Who Are............STILL HOLDING ON               A sad thing about life is when you meet someone and fall in love, only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and that you have wasted years on someone who wasn't worth it. If he isn't worth it now he's not going to be worth it a year or 10 years from now. Let go..... TO ALL MY FRIENDS.......               My wish for you is a man/women whose love is honest, strong, mature, never-changing, uplifting, protective, encouraging, rewarding and unselfish.

       Again, I'm annoyed at L.  I don't know how he manages to piss me off sooo freaking much!  I'm in the middle of interviewing a quality student who is taking A LOT of energy out of me...and her appointment with me started at 10am...and just ended - right now, it's freaking 12:30pm and I'm STARVING but no...I have to interview another student because L. sucked up an hour of my freaking time.  We're busy talking and I'm answering questions and L. shows up and is like "so, I was wondering if you'd be interested and blah blah blah" and L. starts talking about all this bullsh*t and starts to drone on and on and to be honest, I'm really sick of hearing about his past and his background.  Honestly - all that bullsh*t can be summarized in two minutes instead of freaking 20 minutes.  It really pisses me off.  L. is sad and pathetic.  L.  has no life outside of his wife and what he can call "work".  He doesn't do any work.  When was the last time that he had an appointment.  He hasn't done anything for our upcoming open house.  L. just annoys me because he just complains and complains and talks way too much about irrevelant bullsh*t.  If there was anything that I have to complain about this job is just L.  I despise the fact that he was suddenly made my supervisor after 1.5 months of him being my equal because he complained too much.  I despise the fact that I work longer and harder than him and yet he tries to take the credit...did I mention how he has been trying hard to steal students from me....bastard.  I'm off to another appointment and hungry as heck.  :(

       To clear up a lot of confusion or rumors...no, I am not engaged.  Yes, my boyfriend and I are deeply in love with each other and we do see a future together, but it's not like that.  We're taking things step by step.  Our relationship has always been unrushed and taken when we are ready.  I know that we talk about all these things...we talk about our kids and how we're going to raise them...we talk about our dream house.  BUT...at the same time, we're not both not at a stage in our lives where we're ready to commit and settle down.  I see myself still trying to get myself out of debt for another two-three years.  I see myself wanting to buy my condo first before I do anything else...and yes, I would like to get my driver's license before marriage :-P  Some things just need to come first.  I just started my job at PCOM and I would like to get myself settled and ready to start moving forward with this job.  Kuan just started with Cornerstone America - for goodness sakes, he just got his business cards last week.  For him, I know that he needs to financially stabilize himself first.  Yeah - financial stability is a very important aspect in both of our lives.  So, yeah - I do see Kuan as my future, but at the same time, I am focusing on my present and that entails: my career, my schooling...heehee...definately working on my massage license is another focus of mine, as well, and saving up for my condo.

       L. managed to annoy me today...after a week or two of not not bothering me, he managed to get on my nerves again today.  It was a pretty small thing.  I'm sittiing here doing my own thing and running phone calls and he goes to check the mail and he's complaining about something to me.  I'm trying to listen but at the same time, I am on the phone so there is only so much of his complaining that I can listen to.  Then, when I hang up, he was like "Are you making personal calls and not paying attention to me?"  No, I am not making any personal calls - I'm busy trying to set up appointments...grrrr...anyway, he b*tches and complains some more and if anything..it just put me to annoyance and makes me sleepy, too.  Well, last night, I had dinner at Kuan's house with his family, which was nice...played a couple games with his brother and him...and today, back to work - been here since freaking 8am and I'll be here until after class - on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, too!  But the nice thing about today is that Kuan was around my workplace surveying, canvassing, and whoring himself around so we met up for lunch at Nahana's - where they supposedly had $1 sushi but it was false advertising...grrr...oh, well.  Back to work now..

       My weekend flew by and I'm just glad that it's over.  Enough said.  On the other side, there's plenty of things to be grateful for.  I have an amazing father who is always looking out for me and I've got Grace, despite our differences, I know that we love each other to bits.  I've got an awesome and understanding boyfriend where our relationship is still growing stronger and stronger.  And classes are going well..and work is getting better and better.  As you can tell, I'm trying to focus on the positive instead of the negative.

       It's freaking Friday night and almost 9:30pm and I just got home from work...it's been a hella long week..I feel so tired...and so stressed at the same time.  I will not cry anymore.  I cry too much.  I tear up too easily.  I found out that tear ducts are larger than guys...that's why girls tear up so easily.  Our tear ducts in our skeleton are larger therefore, we have less to help us hold it in.  You know what's so true...I was reading something that someone wrote - a girl will never admit that she has cried over you.  I'm not saying that anything is wrong with my boyfriend or our relationship is horrible...but sometimes, when I talk to him and I've having such a bad day, I start tearing up like I am right now.  And it's not like I'm crying over him....I'm just so upset and yeah...it's not him.  It's me.  Story of my life.  And today, I just missed him and I started feeling guilty about my crazy busy schedule and how I really need to get a control and stick to a budget that I create.  What's the point of creating budgets and plans for myself if I'm not going to stick with it?  I'm going to finish what I started.  And I'm going to be strong.  I know that I've been bitching about work...but I'm okay...work has been very ....exhausting but it was worth it.  It's going to help me grow and learn from everything.  I am exhausted...I am disappointed that I won't be in California next weekend.  I am thinking of ways for me to make money.  I'm thinking about selling stuff via craigslist.  Is craigslist or ebay better?  You tell me...  I'll figure it out.  Tomorrow is a new day....tomorrow, I have to go into work...tomorrow, I will finish moving the rest of my stuff around and clean my room...tomorrow, I will study more for my tests next week...tomorrow, I will not cry....tomorrow, I will be strong.  My mom keeps on calling me today.  I can't talk to her - I'm so tired.  Damn it.  I didn't think that I'd say this but I do miss her a lot.  I miss how things used to be.  I used to be able to talk to her about everything and anything.  I used to be able to cry to her and trust her.    Oh, yeah...from now on until August - I am not allowed to spend any money on myself.  I'm not allowed to do anymore online shopping - I'm not allowed to buy myself anything unless it is necessary to survival (aka food and that's it)...Life isn't always fair...and yeah, as I've  heard others tell me...when you're young, you're supposed to eat bitterness (so the Chinese cliche goes)...and yet, you're only young once.  So, waht the fuck is it?  Are you supposed to suffer first or are you supposed to enjoy your life?  Sometimes, I think that there is so much bitterness that I don't know how much more I can handle but at the same time, how fucking selfish is that of me?  I need to take care of myself and my shit and my responsibilities.  That's not fair of me to dump my crap onto anyone else.  I need to stabilize everything and handle everything before I even dare to think of running away.  Out of nowhere, I miss someone from my past.  I wish that fate wasn't so cruel.  He had sooo much going for him and he was this amazing friend who just KNEW me.  And it's been four years since he passed away and it still rips at me.  I don't really know who I can talk to about it.  I usually turn to his older brother whenever I start feeling shitty about the whole thing but I can't do that right now...there's too much crap going on....sorry, I'm trying hard not to swear.  If he could hear me now, he'd tell me how out of character I've become.  I wish that he was here right now...I wish that I could just turn to him and just pour my heart out about everything..about work, school, kdphi, my relationship, my friends, my family, my faith....and this overwhelming feeling of negativity....I've tried so hard lately....and I feel like ....*************....I feel taken for granted and I feel unappreciated and i feel like crying right now....

       I should feel better cuz it's Friday but I'm not... I'm super sore from my acupuncture treatment I'm sleepy and I did not sleep well.  I'm so busy with work and school and I have no time.  No time to freaking concentrate and work on anything...I'm gettiing so frustrated and I'm ready to just throw in the towel right now.  I'm tired of people taking me for granted and people not appreciating my time and effort.  Fawk you.  Fuck you for not being appreciative and being so damn demanding.  Everything is getting on my nerves.  I took my cell phone off of AIM - people pissed me off way too much.  On a side note...I guess that I'm finally getting around to taking care of some things.. Picture Update :-) Midyear 2004 (Houston, Texas)... on the plane with Purdue: Tessa & Yvonne (Essence & Elite)         And you got the National Alumnae Board holding it down...and of course, below, the Spring 2K1 Charters, then, me with my Donna :-P (btw, Don - the pic underneath is for you!)         And wow...I used to be VP Internal (a long time ago) when these two girls were pledging....and look at them now as the new and improved VP Internals!  urlLink    Now, for my weekend trip to Purdue (after work on Saturday)...I was greeted with this hot charter...  urlLink    To everyone that I saw - good seeing y'all - my Spring 2k1 (Connie, Elise, and Linda), Purdue KDPhis (congrats on a great first party, girls - and sending you girls much love and support always), UIC KDPhis (especially my biggie..as if I don't see you enough ;-) ), UIUC KDPhis, TaoTao holding it down for UMich, Tracey representing UPenn, and all the boys, of course.           haha...pictures that I am not posting on my other xanga but I'll post here..

       I like it..so far, I like it.  :)  It's shorter but long layers..it looks much healthier and it looks chic.  :)  I'm listening to James Ingram's Just Once...and it brings back memories...good memories.  How everything just kinda comes around...full circle.  And life is a rollercoaster but at the end, everything does plateau out and everything is okay once I'm on solid ground again.  And life is full of learning experiences....you live and learn, right?  And just cuz something doesn't go your way doesn't mean anything...it means that life is still a learning experience.  *wink*  Now, off to some wings at McGees and then, studying for my Anatomy & Physiology test tomorrow...

       Last night...someone called me from my past...and hearing his voice just brought back sooo many bad memories and on top of that, it made me feel crappy...but then, I realized that I don't want to waste my time anymore so I hung up on him and turned off my cell phone.  I have this amazing boyfriend who sometimes can be a dork and sometimes inconsiderate but overall, he's pretty amazing and pretty in tune with me.  and he loves me for me.  That's all that I need.

       Okay, so Kuan and I drove down to Purdue for the Lambda/KDPhi party  okay...when we first got there, he dropped me off at the hotel so i could nap and he could go eat with the charters...but i couldn't sleep..i got this weird vibe that someone was watching me...and the curtains over the window wouldn't close all the way...  So, Kuan comes back; we get ready for the party; go to the party; go to the Lambda house afterwards and come back to sleep at the hotel...I passed out first...and had this trippy dream.  I dreamt about some sort of book or whatever and I was with this group and they were talking about seances and spirits and stuff.  Towards the end of the dream, I dreamt that there was someone sitting at the coffee table in the hotel room with me and he was staring up at this dead body hanging from the ceiling - right by the window.  That's when I wake up and I shake Kuan to tell him that I just had a nightmare and when he asked what it was about, I said "Ghosts"...he shuddered and groaned and went back to sleep...when he woke up, he said that he had problems sleeping and for some reason, he felt like someone was watching him when he turned off the lights...so he was watching tv for like two hours before actually going to bed.  And the weird trippy thing is that he felt like someone from the window or that corner by the table was watching him.......*SHUDDER*

       So, I didn't do so well on my Anatomy test...my fault - I've been so busy that even when I do study, it's not productive studying.  *sigh*  I feel really drained.  Just trying to stay afloat with work and school has me so busy and then, kdphi stuff on top of everything?  I'm kinda ready to just step back and not run for National Alumnae Board again.  I originally wanted to run for Midwest RC since I've been the Lt. RC for the last two years...but I'm so tired.  I don't know if I can handle it anymore.  Especially considering when I've got all this other stuff going on in my life.  I'm just really tired and I should just go to bed already and stop blabbing before I say something that I'll regret....  When is it time to let go?  Of something that you love sooo much and you've given so much to...when is it time for me to let go of KDPhi and truly move on with my life...?  Sometimes, I wish that I could just say goodbye and let go and truly be an alumna instead of feeling 'burdened'....I wish that people could understand that it's not as easy as it looks...and sooner or later...those who lie in the shadows will grow tired and fade away in the dark.

       Lemme vent about our Receptionist....grrr...his name is R.  just R. for now.  Okay, I've worked in professional places before...you either have a freaking receptionist to ANNOUNCE phone calls or you just have an automated system that redirects you.  He never announces phone calls, NEVER - lemme just repeat that and he's a dumb@$$.  He redirects the most unworthy phone calls to me - for example, some lady wanted to contact an old teacher that we fired.  And she wasted a good 10 minutes of my time.  Oh, another thing - if I'm in a f*cking appointment/interview, do NOT direct calls to me - are you retarded or something?  The most distracting thing is when I'm in the middle of interviewing someone and my phone is just ringing off the d*mn hook.  You retard - just freaking redirect it to my voicemail - is that so freaking hard to do?!?  And today...I get into work and there is a main printer right next to my office and I'm printing up some reports and I pick up two extra papers...and they're freaking cover letters for job applications from R.  How freaking retarded are you?  First of all, he just started here two weeks ago and he does a sh*tty job already.  And he's applying for jobs at his current job...Second of all, if you're going to print something personal, HIDE IT....or freaking go to the printer as soon as you print something to grab it off the printer.  Man....I'm ready to fire his @$$ before he even quits here.

       Well, I woke up early - as usual but for some reason, I have no desire to brave the cold and go to work.  I don't know what it is but today is just not one of those days that I can just jump out of bed and can't wait to get the day started.  Today is another long day where I have class at the very end of work.  But this song came on and for some reason, I'm thinking of my boyfriend and how lately, I just haven't had the time for him.  I know that actions speak louder than words but it does make me sad...when on Thursday, we had a date.  We ate and came back to my place and passed out.  And then, yesterday - prime example.  We woke up early and went downstairs to watch morning cartoons and I made breakfast for us...and then, we went upstairs and we napped some more...went to his house...had lunch and then, I was reading and I fell asleep downstairs so I went upstairs and passed out in his bed...he joined me and we were asleep for a good 2-3 hours (man..and his parents weren't home then which could have meant *wink* but no, we were good and ASLEEP)...we watched the SUper Bowl and I fell asleep during it...I don't know why but I was sooo tired and last night, I went to bed at 2am - normal time and woke up early and now, I feel so blase.  *sigh*  and now to disappear this week...got another test this wednesday - I will resurface on Thursday after my test.

       So, I went to the Northwestern NU Las Palmas rush party...started off okay...got to see a few people and then, I'm on the phone and some chick puked right in front of me and it splattered onto my boot.  FAWK..luckily, my twin Thomas showed me to the bathroom to help me clean up...  I got a chance to chill with James whom I haven't seen since he used to live in my apartment two summers ago in Santa Barbara.  And I met some guy, Howard, from Delaware and Kuan kept on giving me funny looks while I was talking to him, so I ended up leaving him and our random conversation (he was kinda drunk and I think that he was hitting on me, but I wasn't sure) to go onto the dance floor with him.  I chilled for a bit with my twin and Brian (Zergling) and his gf...  After an hour at the party, Kuan and I decided to leave...and on our way out, someone opened up the door right on my right scapula (keep in mind - the bad shoulder that I've been getting treatments for since October) and I've been in pain for the whole day already...bleah.  Other than that, Kuan has been amazingly patient with me...and just eveyrthing that i've been going through...there's so much aksgjlgjasgljgl;  going on.  Bleah.  And tomorrow is another LONG week.  :(  Life goes on...

       $20 Bill- A well-known speaker started off  his seminar by holding up a $20.00 bill. In the room of 200, he asked,  "Who would like this $20 bill?"  Hands started going up.     He said, "I am going to give this  $20 to one of you but first, let me do this."     He proceeded to crumple up the $20 dollar bill.    He then asked, "Who still wants  it?"  Still the hands were up in the air.     "Well," he replied, "What if I do  this?"      And he dropped it on the ground and started to grind  it into the floor with his shoe.     He picked it up, now crumpled and  dirty.     "Now, who still wants it?" Still the hands went into the air.    xXdExtEr4mEEhXx (11:05:22 PM): "My friends, we have all learned a  very valuable lesson. No matter what I did to the money, you still  wanted it because it did not decrease in value.     It was still worth  $20.      Many times in our lives, we are dropped,  crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way.     We feel as though we are  worthless.      But no matter what has happened or what will happen,  you will never lose your value.     Dirty or clean, crumpled or finely  creased, you are still priceless to those who DO LOVE you.     The worth of our lives comes not in what we do or who we know, but by WHO WE  ARE.     You are special - Don't EVER  forget it."

       I need some advice... I got a call back from Rapid Displays.I went through an extensive interview  process (not only did I interview there four times but I also had to take this online psych exam and online personality test and an online accounting test, as well) way back in October when I was looking for jobs...anyway, I got a voicemail two days ago from their COO offering me a position with their company - the original position that I had applied to was filled (I was one of the last two candidates) and apparently, they have another position that they think would suit me better....I finally got a chance to talk to him this morning - with my background as Controller for NCSA - he's now offering me a chance to be a Senior Accountant with them. Brian said that the reason why  I was turned down for the other job position is because it was entry level and he felt that I would get bored with it easily. He said that the current one is retiring and eh thought of me immediately.  If i'm interested, I'd have to go through some HR stuff but pretty much, the job is mine.  He hasn't even started advertising for the position and he won't start to until I decline this job offer.    Anyway...with this Senior position, I would have 17 people under me and reporting to me and  well, I'll just do a pros and cons...  pros: I'm getting offered starting off $65K/year and after my introductory period of 4 months, possible raise (that's a lot than what I got at NCSA and also a lot more than what I'm getting at PCOM....) and I would have better benefits (as in 100% insurance coverage unlike now, I pay for 50% out of my paycheck) and this company offers me more support in regards to going back  to grad school for my MBA...  cons: it's far far far away....which would mean that I'd have to move to the South side of Chicago once my lease is up in April (I was slowly moving more and more north - haha...eventually hoping to buy my condo in Evanston and be close to my boyfriend) and my commute from my current house would be 1 hr and 15 minutes to 1.5 hrs....plus I'd be further away from Kuan, too...The  area isn't exactly the safest and best area (right now, I'm working in Lakeview - right by Lincoln Park - so it's a posh area) I mean...the North side is more expensive but it has good and easy access to downtown and I just like the area much better but the South side is cheaper (for the price of a studio in the north side - I can get a 1/2 bdrm apt on the South side but I am paying for location)  I don't know if I can see myself with this company long term. I can see myself with them for maybe 5 years and making and saving up enough money. However, with my current job, I can see myself here and possibly either moving up in Staff or going into their Faculty if I stick with my current massage curriculum. For the most part, I like the people that I work with (with the exception of L. who pisses me off) and the people at Rapid Displays are so much older  and I'd definately be on the younger spectrum. I dunno - there's so many cons to goign to Rapid Displays and I feel like my only incentive going there is money.  I feel like I'm having loyalty issues. Do I stick with my current job and my current idea of going into massage (a part of wanting to go into massage was also to make up for my lack of pay so I could make more money and it could help me with my "Donna buying condo" savings fund) or do I go for MORE MONEY?

       Well..I need to get into this one program and L. and R. are both using it.  R. is incredibly  busy and L. is just shooting random info around and managing to just annoy me.  I'm sleepy and tired and just want to go home but I have this 6pm appointment.  WtF is wrong with me - I should just call her and be like, I can't do it.  Argh!  Man, what a night this is going to be.....  L. has managed to work my last nerve today.  He was so unprepared for his meeting this morning - I ended up typing up the agendas and I ended up doing the minutes because if i didn't, it just wouldn't get freaking done.  I feel like my day has been very packed.  I had a total of a whopping four appointments today not including my 6pm one.  Hence, it's looking to be a very very busy week for me.  Tomorrow, I have four appointments and Thursday, I have four in addition to some meetings, too.  *sigh*  Damn L.  He cracks these STUPID jokes that no one else finds funny.  I need to really ignore him because he's starting to get on my nerves AGAIN.  He hasn't had any appointments in the past two weeks except for the one appointment that I couldn't make so I asked him to take over her appt instead.  Honestly...how can he be my supervisor when he acts so incompetent and he's so lazy...I need a leader to follow by example.  Having him around makes me frustrated and makes me want to be lazy and stuff, too.  *sigh*

       I don't know if this will work but it is worth a shot.. Happy aKDPhi Founders Day! Happy 24th Birthday to my boyfriend!  :-)  It all started on Thursday when I took him out to dinner to Heaven on Seven and Friday, off to Purdue for some bday celebrating...and now, I'm at his place for some family bday cake and stuff. ::Edit::  I guess that he's not taking me home tonight cuz he's tired..that's what old age will do to you.  It's kinda interesting..I was talking to someone and I realized that my mother has had a stronger effect on me than I realized.  My mom is a whopping six months (exactly) older than my dad and all the while growing up, she always said "Never date anyone younger than you...even your own age is stretching it"  hence I've never had a boyfriend younger than me...and rarely have I ever dated a guy that was even my own age.  And it seems that way with Kuan cuz I'm always stretching his age.  Before his birthday, when people asked me how old he was, I'd be like "Oh, he's almost 24...."  heehee...now, I can say that "Oh, he's almost 25"...maybe it's just me being weird. ::Another edit:: Random trip to Purdue..my grand lil and me at BW3 for wings..(hey Venus...we look really tired :-P )   NU party at Las Palmas     And then, the bday celebration in Purdue..first of all, look how innocent he used to be...AWWW...and then, now..    And then, Yugo LICKED my boyfriend...   Then, the Purdue KDPhis and me (the two Dianas, Miss Iron Chef, my grand lil and me - dang, my grand lil is so red!)         Cindy and me - a year later we take a picture together...except this time, you're hiding behind me again!   And then, time for some couple pictures..heehee...Kuan and me looking normal and then, our regular goofy selves and then, my grand lil and her birthday boyfriend         and then...the results on Saturday morning..     And then, the "normal" family bday celebration :-P hope that you liked your gift, hon!  ;-)  His sister, brother, and I teamed up and got him a digital camera :-)

       We have calculated your responses according to our scientific formula and harmonized the results to the Venutian lunar calendar. If you are not already attached, keep in mind that all men who cross your path may be grooms in disguise.  YOU WILL BE MARRIED BY: Saturday, July 21, 2007 A number of different factors influenced your result. Check out the details below.                      less likely to marry    more likely to marry         Social Factors  On the social front, you are pretty serious marriage material.  As you read this, forces beyond your control are aligning to put you on the altar with Mr. Right.  It's you, girl.  Your number is up, and someone out there is just dying to pop you the question.  There's no need to book a flight to Vegas, but you might want to start thinking about your wedding gown.                     less likely to marry    more likely to marry         Emotional Factors  Emotionally, you seem to be fairly ready for marriage.  You show strong signs of being a contender, and you've got what it takes to make the plunge.  Maybe any hesitation is just a small case of the "jitters."  In any case, for Mr. Right, it's practically a done deal.  He's just waiting for the right moment, so sit back and let it happen.                     less likely to marry    more likely to marry         Sexual Factors  You have very few sexually motivated reasons for avoiding marriage.  Of course, the carefree single life can pose a strong attraction, but you probably prefer the thought of devoting yourself to one person.  It's true that there are a lot of unsolved mysteries out there, but once you've found the right person, it's time to close shop.  Congratulations on having the strength and security to know what's right for you.

       REVERSE RACIST by-Bao Phi   I’m gonna take every white man from his job and force him to construct light rail transit systems for 50 cents an hour.  When they’re done I’ll make sure they are moved to a special little section of town that we’ll call Whiteyville, where tourists can come to shop for curios and eat exotic hot dish meals.  When the American mainstream tongue gets a taste for hot dish, I’m going to open my own fusion hot dish restaurants where I combine hot dish with Asian recipes, and charge people ten times what the food is worth.  All the waiters and waitresses will be forced to wear traditional Scandinavian garb.                    I’m going to run for office, promising equality for white men, then when I get elected, I’m going to pass laws that forbid white guys from marrying Asian women.  Then I’m going to hit on every single white woman I see and spread rumors about how white guys got small dicks and how white guys are no good for women because they come from such a male dominated society.                    I’m going to teach nothing but Asian American history in every classroom, and when little Morty Crackerman raises his hand and asks “teacher, teacher, why don’t we study any white people?”  I will have him branded as a troublemaker and suspend him from school for 3 days.  Then I will feel a little guilty about it and declare National Whitey Appreciation Week, we’ll study the contributions of Kip Winger and Harold Bloom while eating hamburgers and listening to Smashmouth.   We will watch the Honkeytown Crackers play against the Whiteyville Honkies, and in the bleachers we’ll do the Wave and the “white men can’t dance” dance.                    When white men complain, I’ll sigh deeply and say, “hey, things are better for you now.  You should have tried being around twenty years ago, before me and some other good Asians marched with you white people for your rights.  Don’t blame me for racism, that stuff happened a long time ago, and anyway, I can’t be racist!  My girlfriend is white and so are some of my best friends and servants!”  Every time a white man fucks up, I’ll just shake my head sorrowfully and say, “see?” Then I’ll declare that there are too many white men in America, and I’ll deport them.  And I’ll restrict immigration for white men.  The only white men allowed into this country will be the most highly educated white men from Europe: I mean, hey, we need someone to work behind the counter at the gas stations for minimum wage, and who else is gonna drive taxis or run 24 hour grocery stores in the hood?                    I’m gonna build garbage dumps in white neighborhoods and make sure there’s a lot of lead in their water supply.  When the power cuts out in the city, it’ll be at least three days till it gets back on for white people cuz they’re gonna fix the power lines in Asian hoods first.                    When white men become successful, I’ll beat them down in the street and make sure my Asian friends in the news don’t report on it, and if it goes to trial I’ll make sure the all Asian jury and Asian judge pardons me, just to be safe.  Then after all this hard (yet satisfying) work exploiting and oppressing and mindfucking whitey, I’m going on vacation to Europe, with a big ass backpack, smoking French cigarettes, I will not shave nor take a shower, complain about how dirty Europeans live, then go to those special clubs where white women pay to meet Asian American men.  Maybe I’ll even marry one of them and take them back with me, but maybe not, cuz I can only have so much luggage and I can always send for one by mail order later on.  I will open branches of my fastfood chains and hotels on European soil, and I’ll grease the palms of shady white Europeans so they can keep an eye on things and if they fuck up: hey, it’s their fault.                    Due to terrorist hate crimes against Asians, I will declare war on Europe.  Just to be safe, I’m gonna forcibly remove white American people from their homes because I feel they are a threat to national security.  They can stay at the dog racing tracks until we are sure that they are good and loyal to this country.  And we will take everything they ever owned.  I will recruit white people to fight against other white people, promising that we’ll take care of them if things go wrong, but if things do go wrong and white people find their way into overcrowded planes and leaky boats to seek refuge in Asian America, I’ll turn them away and say “Sorry! No room.”                    During the war, I will drown my sorrows at dramatically lit bars in Europe.  I will win a white prostitute from her evil white pimp in a game of cards.  We will have sex, and she will fall in love with me.  I will leave her, pregnant, in Europe.  When I come back to visit her, she thrusts her baby into my arms, tells me that Asian America is a much better place for our bastard lovechild, and then she will kill herself.  Tragic, but good drama.  So good, in fact, that I turn it into a Broadway musical and make a ton of money off of it.  Asian actors will put on white makeup and act like white people.  You know, I’d love to put real white people in the play, but their just not talented enough.                    When white men form their own groups to protect themselves, I’ll accuse them of being separatists and reverse racists, and force them to let me into their groups.  Then I’ll cut their budgets because they’re really not serving the majority of people.  And when they crumple into a ball, when they raise their voices to speak, when they go insane from it all, that’s when I’ll pat them on the back, and say, that’s just the way it is.  But we’re all human.  Don’t hate me, don’t be a  reverse racist.

       A Mom is driving a little girl to her friend's house for a play date.   "Mommy," the little girl asks, "how old are you?"   The mother looks over at the little girl and says, "Honey, you are not supposed to ask a lady her age, it isn't polite," the mother warns.   "Okay," the little girl says, "how much do you weigh?"   "Now really," the mother says, "these are personal questions that are really none of your business."   Undaunted, the little girl asks, "Why did you and daddy get a divorce?"   "Enough questions now, honestly!" The exasperated mother walks away as the two friends begin to play.   "My mom wouldn't tell me anything," the little girl says to her friend.   "Well," says the friend, "all you need to do is look at her driver's license. It's like a report card, it has everything on it."   Later that night the little girl says to her mother, "I know how old you are, you are 32."   The mother is surprised and asks, "How did you find that out?"   "I also know that you weigh 140 pounds."   The mother is past surprise and shock now. "How in heaven's name did you find that out?"   The little girl continues on triumphantly, "And... I know why you and daddy got divorced."   "Oh really?" the mother asks, "why is that?"   The girl replies, "Because you got an F in sex.

       I don't like people to see my cry.  Like really cry...it's one thing to get sniffles and tears...but all out bawling...  I've been needing to cry...been needing a good outlet.  And today just kinda presented itself an opportunity for me.  I don't know what it is...really.  It's a little bit of everything...a bit of work...a bit of school...a bit of kdphi...a whole bit of family..a bit of outside drama...a bit of b*tchy people..a bit of frustration...and a bit of the bf, too.  I usually prefer not to let people be there when I bawl.  It's a pride thing, I guess.  But today, I wanted someone to be there and it didn't work out.  And so goes life.  And so I cried...just needed to let everything out.

       Man..last night I couldn't sleep - I knew that I had to wake up early this morning to run some errands...go to the bank...go to Kinko's..and when I couldn't sleep - what did I do?  I did my taxes.  Eeep..  My throat still kills like no other and it kinda still hurts when I talk and for some reason, when Kuan said that he missed me last night...I wanted to be selfish and be like 'get your butt here then' but no, I know that he has his business to take care of.  I still need to run my errands but more importantly, I need to get my butt in action to do all this stuff!  *sigh*  I have a long day ahead...errands and then, get to work.  And I just realized that the red line won't be running - DARN!  *sigh*  At least, there's the halsted bus.

       I feel so bad - he's been working so hard on this job since December and I feel like he hasn't gotten anywhere.  He's giving himself a 2 week ultimatum and if it doesn't work out, he's going to be looking for another job.  Man, I feel so bad for him.  It sucks and I know how rough it is on him.  It really sucked....this morning, he was like "Donna, I want to give you so much but I can't.."  and I keep on telling him that I don't need or want anything - everything that I need and want - he does give it to me.  He loves me with such fervance and he accepts me for who I am.  I don't want anything more...I just want him to be happy.  I feel so bad that he's struggling financially - I wish that I could help him out, but I can't.

       It's Wednesday morning and I'm feeling...tired.  It's my fault.  I didn't go to bed until 2:30am.  I really need to stop doing this.  So horrible.  I took a really long nap with Kuan yesterday so I guess that was it, too.  I'm so behind in everything....but I am trying to prioritize myself with work and school first.  Sorry for everything and everyone that comes thereafter.  KDPhi just isn't as high of a priority for me as it used to be.  I am so tired.  Must get myself going and off to work!

       I shouldn't be so tired but I am.  :( *sigh*  and life goes on....they were painting my office today so I got to work from home today.  I was really tempted to play hooky and go to the museum since it was a museum free day at the Museum of Science and Industry...but pros of today...Kuan came over for lunch - yay!  We haven't done that in a while - I got to make him lunch...and then, we went out to Trader Todd's for dinner.  A little bit more quality time with my loving boyfriend!  Cons...there is SOOOO much that I need to do at work and I'm feeling TIRED plus I've got Anatomy & Physiology tomorrow.  :(

       well...I'm really bitter and angry and pissed and concerned all at once.  I know, I know..it's not me who got hurt but I'm pissed that anyone would do that to anyone.  You f*cker - how could you and how dare you?!?  On a up note...I'm so amazed with my relationship with Kuan...I really feel like we're hitting new heights all the time.  He manages to amaze day after day...we talk about all these things that not only reassures me that it's okay for me to be busy and me to have all these goals and dreams and that he is here to support me.  It always seems like when I have these goals and dreams and I get crazy busy, my significant other just kinda goes away...and I know that I have to be selfish sometimes and somehow, my boyfriend supports me being selfish..(sometimes *wink*)...

       I don't know what to say.  I feel so horrible and I wish that I had the words to take your pain away or at least wipe the tears off of your face.  :(  I swear...guys can be so inconsiderate and I wish that I could do something.  I know that I don't know how you feel or what you're going through.  I've had my heart broken before and I know how much that hurts and I can only offer you my listening ear and supporting shoulder.  Love you...hate to see you hurting like you do.

       Well, I'm sucking up my pride and getting an educational loan.  This semester - I was only paying $580 a month..but next semester, I'm taking double the classes hence I'll be paying a little over $1000 a month...and the last semester, it's going to be about $740 a month...and with the studio and everything else, I'm going to need some help.  I hate admitting that I need help.  I hate the fact that I'm trying to study for my Oriental Medicine midterm and I'm worrying about money.  Argh.  I'll be okay...but it's an investment and it'll be worth it.  I'll be okay...I'll be okay.

       here's another update copies and pasted from xanga...only cuz it has pictures :-) I'm happy...I'm really happy - a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders..I've decided on the job.  I've decided to stay with PCOM.  Money isn't going to make me happier...if anything, it's just going to me stabilize myself fiinancially but it's definately not going to help me stabilize emotionally or career-wise and location-wise.  So, goodbye to 17 people underneath me and reporting to me..goodbye to my own personal secretary...and goodbye to $65K/year..and NO REGRETS.  Instead, I am happy with where I am in life.  I have a stable job where I enjoy what I'm doing...I'm in a great part-time program where it's not only benefiting myself personally but it's benefiting my career...I have a wonderful boyfriend (enough said about him)..  I have a great support sytem (my parents - as kooky as they can be, Mom said to go for the money and my Dad said to go with my heart...my sibs...my pledge sisters...my HS buddies...my greek sisters)...and yesterday was just the icing on the cake...after I made up my mind about the job, I got to hang out with the Midwest Alumnae at Gamekeepers (I love their 10 cent wings!!  Such a great deal)!!  Pictures coming soon...  and on that note, Happy Friday the 13th!  :::EDIT::  I know that I haven't been online lately - basically, at work, they upgraded all of our computers and usually, I'll sneak in some side work (like KDPhi stuff and some personal stuff)...anyway, the new IT administrator added some new features to our computers, including the fact that I can't download anything and install any new programs which sucks...but the worst part is: he installed this program that takes a screenshot of my computer once an hour and then, sends it to our administration - so they know exactly what we're doing and which programs we have running.  I didn't get caught but one of my co-workers got caught checking personal email, another got caught applying for another job, and another one got caught for chatting....so, I'm being good now at work.           AND I found the perfect studio and turned in the application for it...if all works out, I'm living in a highrise right by Lake Shore Drive with a gorgeous view of the city AND the lake...*sigh*  It's beautiful and spacious!

       First off...after a tedious and LONG search for the perfect studio, I found it - or rather Miguel from Apartment People found it for me.  :)  I'm sooo happy about it.  It's just perfect.  It has everything that I wanted...or close to it.  The thing that kinda did it for me - it's a 16 floor high rise building...on the very top of it has a huge sundeck that goes all the way around the building - and when we got up there, the sun was setting and you had such a city view and you had a view of the lake, as well - soooo pretty - it turns out that I'm only a block and half away from Lake Michigan - how awesome is that.  A bit more while I gush on my studio and then, about my sweetie...here's my original check list: Looking for a studio/1 bdrm apt (probably a studio) near either the Fullerton/Belmont Red Line stops or close by Clark/Broadway/Halsted/Addison buses (I work on Broadway)  -It's about 5 blocks from the Belmont Red/Purple/Brown line...1 block from the Broadway/Clark buses...and the express bus is right outside of my front door  Maybe I am being too picky but I would like a decent sized bathroom with space to put all my toiletries (I am female)...with a vent in the bathroom preferred, walk-in closet (instead of those sliding closets)..enough space to put a 6 ft couch and a full size bed...in the kitchen, the typical stove, fridge, cabinet space, but also enough counter space to put a microwave and rice cooker...I need to have laundry in the building...would prefer to have an elevator, as well...no pets - I'm allergic to cats...   - well, it's a 16 story high rise with plenty of elevators....hardwood floors...HUGE walk-in closet (practically the size of my bedroom or bigger in bridgeport) ...separate dining area...HUGe living space (more than enough space to put both my 10 ft and 6 ft couches and my bed)...the kitchen has decent counter space and it also has a whole floor of laundry facilities and they have this used book trade thing, too.  They have a basement for storage and a bike room (I'm thinking of investing in a bike)  On a side note, I would prefer to be somewhat close by a Bank One...near a grocery store..have somewhat decent street parking or even a parking lots/indoor/outdoor parking..and not too close to Wrigley Field to avoid the Cubs fans traffic...  -further away from Wrigley Field...there is a Dominic's 1.50-2 blocks away with a Bank one inside..parking is the only drawback..  -The best thing is the VIEW - I am a block and half away from the lake/beach...yay!!  The deck on top - you get a BEAUTIFUL view of the city and the lake!  It's sooo pretty - 4th of July party at my place!!  My lease starts in April...it includes all utilities AND I get one month free, too!  :)  Yay!  Okay, about my sweetie now...For Vday, he surprised me with a bouquet of red roses (I've never gotten red roses before....and he's never given me flowers....WOAH) and he also got me the cutest card...I love it.  We were supposed to make dinner together but we ended up getting too full.  :-)  But it's okay, we've kinda created our own memories...I'm such a lucky girl.  I love my boyfriend ::blush::

       omg....I got off of work and managed to score myself a free queen sized mattress off of Craigslist - I swear, I am sooo addicted to CL.  :-)  I love how easy it is to post stuff on there and also how easy it is to exchange things, as well.  It took Kuan and I about 30 minutes to set everything up - luckily the place was only like 5 blocks from my house which was pretty cool.  I'm excited - it's only a year old and it even has a pillow top and looks pretty new, too.  YAY!  Afterwards, we went to KMart to get some clothesline rope to tie the mattress to the top of his car...and we saw this deal with Little Cesar's Pizza...one large pizza with one topping for only $5 and crazy bread for 99 cents....yup - that's what we had for dinner.  We were supposed to hit up this networking mixer at the Union Bar but we got there and drove around for like 45 minutes looking for parking and in the end, we just scrapped the idea and drove by my new studio...and Kuan mentioned how much it's gonna be a pain in the butt to find parking when I move into my new place.  We'll see, I guess.  Dunno what else to say.  Sacrificing the boyfriend's request to have decent parking wasn't in my top priorities when I was house hunting.  came back..got some cuddle time with him and then, I passed out.  Omg...I was sooo tired and then, I woke up two hours later panicky cuz I haven't packed yet for this weekend's trip to baltimore!  *sigh*  So I'm taking a break from packing to blog.  *smilez*  And now, back to packing!

       I don't know what to give up....my mom suggested meat but I can barely handle giving meat for a couple days.  :(  Plus that's all I eat anyway.  I would give up biting my nails but I have to keep them short for massage..maybe that is what I'll give up - it's a nasty lil habit that I have.  *sigh* What else can I give up?  I rarely drink pop so it's not that big of a deal if I give that up...I guess that I can give up candy, too since I munch too much on it when I'm in the office.  I used to have a bag of oranges that Iw ould eat instead of candy but since that ran out, I'm back to eating candy...so maybe.  I dunno.  I think that I'll give up chocolate.  That way, I at least get my gummy bears..not making any sense right now so I'll just stop and go back to running around

And it's so hard seeing Kuan so down...I wish..I wish that I could make him happy.  Well, I know that I make him happy but it's so hard seeing him down.  It's the same thing with other people that are close to me.  When I see them sad, it makes me sad, too :(

       1.  You are attracted to those who are unbridled, untrammeled, and     free.  2.  In the process of courtship, the approach that would make you     feel irresistable is patience, never give up on you.  3.  The impression you would like to give to your lover is optimistic.  4.  You don't like it when your partner is emotional and/or too     moody; and you don't know how to please him/her.  5.  The kind of relationship you would like to build with your     partner is that both of you can talk about everything and     anything, no secret is kept.  6.  You care about the society and morality, you won't do anything     wrong after marriage.  7.  You think of marriage as a precious thing.  Once you get married,     you'll treasure it and your partner very much.  8.  At this moment, you think of love as a committment for both parties.

       f*ck...sometimes, I just get sick and tired of this moodiness and this crap.  I just want to cut all ties and just not deal with it.  None of it makes any sense anymore.  I hate this feeling and I hate being taken for granted.  I hate it when people go through mood swings and they treat you like you should be grateful for everything...  I hate it how people are just moody and freaking try to pick fights.  And you have to watch what you say.  The rain is just pouring and for some reason, I'm just sad now. hmm....after getting this im.. Numbnutz7LPhiE (12:25:45 AM): I LOVE YOU!  SMOOCH!

       I should be happy that it's Thursday and it's so close to the weekend but I'm feeling tired and blase.  I can't explain it - I just feel drained.  Yesterday was nice...I forgot about my Anatomy class...ehh...went home - got picked up by my boyfriend at the El stop so I didn't have to wait for the darned bus to take me home.  We dropped by the comic book shop..watched a bit of a Spanish movie and then, watch Bedazzled while I made ribs and corn for dinner - yeah, kinda lame but whatever - food is food....  Finished off the night with some studying, some time online, and chatting it up with my roommate, my biggie Leng.  I'm really going to miss her when I move out.  We've had some crazy times...heading to my old office to use the internet, "running" to the ice cream parlor - Margie's...running around Chicago ringing people's doorbells asking if we could see their place, moving in pains, late night talks, and always always EATING.  We've honestly seen each other through our bests and worst...I wish that I could say that we haven't seen each other through some of the worst times in our lives but we have.  She's been there for me when I felt like I failed kdphi and lost both my charter lils...and when I was hospitalized, she was there holding my hand and just overall, she's become like the closest friend to me here in Chicago besides Kuan - but it kinda makes sense that Kuan would be my best friend but she definately comes a close second.  *sigh*  I'm moving in three weeks...so crazy.  There's so much stuff to do.

       YOU ARE CLOSE to finding "the one!" We have carefully calculated your responses according to our scientific formula and harmonized the results to the Venutian lunar calendar. But don't get your hopes up to hear those wedding bells soon, because your bridesmaid days aren't over just yet. YOU WILL BE MARRIED BY: Saturday, July 14, 2007  A number of different factors influenced your result. Check out the details below. On the social front, you are pretty serious marriage material. As you read this, forces beyond your control are aligning to put you on the altar with Mr. Right. It's you, girl. Your number is up, and someone out there is just dying to pop you the question. There's no need to book a flight to Vegas, but you might want to start thinking about your wedding gown.  Emotionally, you seem to be fairly ready for marriage. You show strong signs of being a contender, and you've got what it takes to make the plunge. Maybe any hesitation is just a small case of the "jitters." In any case, for Mr. Right, it's practically a done deal. He's just waiting for the right moment, so sit back and let it happen.  You have very few sexually motivated reasons for avoiding marriage. Of course, the carefree single life can pose a strong attraction, but you probably prefer the thought of devoting yourself to one person. It's true that there are a lot of unsolved mysteries out there, but once you've found the right person, it's time to close shop. Congratulations on having the strength and security to know what's right for you

       The Maid of Honor Deliberate Gentle Love Master (DGLMf)      Appreciated for your kindness and envied for all your experience, you are The Maid of Honor.      Charismatic, affectionate, and terrific in relationships, you are what many guys would call a "perfect catch"--and you probably have many admirers, each wishing to capture your long-term love. You're careful, extra careful, because the last thing you want is to hurt anyone. Especially some poor boy whose only crime was liking you.  Your exact opposite: Half-cocked  Random Brutal Sex Dreamer      We've deduced you're fully capable of a dirty fling, but you do feel that post-coital attachment after hooking up. So, conscientious person that you are, you do your best to reserve physical affection for those you respect...so you can respect yourself.      Your biggest negative is the byproduct of your careful nature: indecision. You're just as slow rejecting someone as you are accepting them.   ALWAYS AVOID: The False Messiah, The 5-Night Stand, The Vapor Trail, The Bachelor  CONSIDER: The Gentleman, someone just like you.

       well....I'm waiting until my digital camera battery is charged before I talk about this weekend and how much fun that I had with my lil sis Coco and my grand lil sis Jia..  In the meantime...just thinking about how so little stuff can make such a big impact on others.  It's hard to put it all into words.  And it's interesting how the past does somewhat dictate the present.  And it's scary how we fear turning into our parents....

        urlLink     What's Your Outlook on Life?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    To Miss  urlLink   Donna Vong    - UCSB Charter #10..(warning - picture intensive entry)  Happy 23rd Birthday!! (dude, I remember when we were celebrating our 20th birthdays...have we gotten that old??)  I've known you since Fall of 1999..living on the 7th floor of San Nic..wow, soo many memories - I really don't know where to begin..we weren't that close starting off when we first met (maybe it was the animosity that we shared the same first name) but we definately grew and went through our ups and downs but all I know is that it only made me love you more and you've redefined the true meaning of sisterhood.  We went through our I.R.I.S. days and you forever will make fun of me not being crafty but it's okay - no one can be a craft nazi like you :cool:  We went through the Gamma Chapter lambda lil sis process and got Tseng...and then, Charter pledgeship (You know that I'm always behind you!)  And once you got your car, you were always down to drive..whether it be in rain or sunshine and whether it be to SLO or to SD...and FOOD - man, we always ate together (must be Annie's influence)...I know exactly what you always order at Jack in the Box..and FOOD coma days...and living wtih you at Garden Court for that one summer where you took care of me when I was sick.  And when I stressed out or wanted to cry, your arms (and chest) were always there for comfort...you gave me the most amazing gift of my twins - Junko & Maggie, and I will be forever grateful to you for that....your letters from England had a "Open Me with a Smile" on the back and managed to cheer me up - you put up with me and my boy-craziness and 'player' stage...and now with our NAB days...yeah, 'nuff said...  Now, despite the distance, you still prove to me over and over again that our friendship does last and grow over time...you've been that solace that I seek out still and words could never describe how much you mean to me and how much we've gone through.  Love you, Don - and I wish you nothing but the best on this special day!                       From Presents to Charter Installs to Alpha Installs with our big bro Tseng                                                   Wow - I'm looking at our pix...we've been all over California - NorCal to SoCal and Texas (twice) and Vegas...more trips!  More Trips!  Happy Bday, Don!  Miss you and love you lots!

       Donna, you are somewhat left-hemisphere dominant and show a preference for visual learning, although not extreme in either characteristic. You probably tend to do most things in moderation, but not always.   Your left-hemisphere dominance implies that your learning style is organized and structured, detail oriented and logical. Your visual preference, though, has you seeking stimulation and multiple data. Such an outlook can overwhelm structure and logic and create an almost continuous state of uncertainty and agitation. You may well suffer a feeling of continually trying to "catch up" with yourself.   Your tendency to be organized and logical and attend to details is reasonably well-established which should afford you success regardless of your chosen field of endeavor. You can "size up" situations and take in information rapidly. However, you must then subject that data to being classified and organized which causes you to "lose touch" with the immediacy of the problem.   Your logical and methodical nature hamper you in this regard though in the long run it may work to your advantage since you "learn from experience" and can go through the process more rapidly on subsequent occasions.   You remain predominantly functional in your orientation and practical. Abstraction and theory are secondary to application. In keeping with this, you focus on details until they manifest themselves in a unique pattern and only then work with the "larger whole."   With regards to your career choices, you have a mentality that would be good as a scientist, coach, athlete, design consultant, or an engineering technician. You can "see where you want to go" and even be able to "tell yourself," but find that you are "fighting yourself" at the darndest times.

       The two grids above are called Numerology Grids.  The numbers from Donna's birth date - her Gregorian calendar birth numbers - are inserted into the Western Grid in certain positions.  Her birth date is then converted into the Chinese lunar calendar, and the equivalent Lunar birth date numbers are inserted into the Chinese Grid, but in different positions.  In this way the Chinese and Western numerological interpretations complement each other.   Character, personality and employment characteristics are gleaned from the position of those numbers in each grid, the quantity of each number, and the lack of numbers. Comments on each number (or sets of numbers) are recorded below.  Green arrows represent positive characteristics derived from having three numbers in a row (horizontal, vertical or diagonal), whilst red arrows represent somewhat negative characteristics derived from three blanks in a row.  Be aware that to read numerology grids accurately takes a lot of practice, and before acting on what you see here you should study the whole subject in much greater detail.  Nor should you disregard the profound influence of genetics and upbringing.   Coming soon: in response to users' demand, in April 2004 this site will be extended to provide a fascinating analysis of an individual's future based upon character and personality traits as defined by Chinese Astrology and Numerology. For in-depth compatibility analysis now, please go to http://www.idealpartner.org.uk.   Another analysis    Ki System   Natal Year number:  1  Donna has the ability to adapt herself to a variety of challenges, and thus has a creative potential that may find expression in art, design, music or literary work.  But with a cautious approach to life, she rarely discloses her innermost thoughts.   Natal Month number:  2  Compassionate and supportive of others, Donna is something of a perfectionist who will find it hard to delegate even routine tasks.  Donna is hard-working and good with details, but to get the best out of her, Donna needs to know that in the end her efforts will be properly rewarded and acknowledged.   Natal House number:  4  With a strong sense of justice, Donna has a balanced but independent view of the major issues affecting life, yet lacks attention to detail.  Inclined to leave things until the very last minute, she will struggle in any employment until she is sufficiently senior to have someone else put into effect the many good ideas that she will contribute.   Comments based on Western Grid 11	Donna is a balanced individual who can understand and appreciate the views of others as well as her own.  She can express herself fluently, and with persuasive conviction, whilst taking account of opposing views.  This means that Donna will get on very well with colleagues at work, both senior and junior, as well as clients, customers, suppliers and external agencies. 4	A practical individual, Donna is a neat and tidy craftsman who can organise others to achieve her plans.  She should use those practical skills and organisational ability in an office management, or secretarial function, or by applying such skills to self-employment.  In general, Donna is a neat and tidy individual - qualities of value to many different jobs. 88	A perceptive individual, Donna takes little on trust.  She maintains fixed views which once established are difficult to change.  Conscientious by nature, she will make a good businessman or accountant, but being naturally perceptive, and unwilling to accept views of others without solid evidence, she may well turn to philosophy. 9	Ambitious to improve her lot, Donna will constantly push forward to achieve something in her life, yet this ambition will be balanced by humanitarian ideals that will lead her to support causes that may demand self-sacrifice. [The Arrow of Scepticism: lacking the numbers 3, 5 and 7]   Taking little on trust, in adult life Donna requires solid proof before she accepts a concept.  Characterised by honesty and fairness, she is quite intuitive, yet firmly sceptical of the claims made, for example, by religion.  This may be important at work, if employers require employee acceptance of work practices that are not immediately verifiable. Comments based on Chinese Grid 11	Donna will be reasonably successful in financial terms, and enjoy a degree of luck. 5	Emotionally well-balanced, Donna is not too intense, and will reach the right decisions.  However, with the numbers 2 and 3 in the Chinese version, the balance may be upset. 7	If the numbers 3 and 5 in the Chinese version are missing, Donna is something of a perfectionist who seeks to achieve detailed accuracy, and has a natural instinct to unearth the truth.  If the Chinese Grid also contains the numbers 3 and 5, she will be attracted to work in a spiritual or humanitarian field. 8	In the absence (in the Chinese version) of the numbers 1 and 6, she will be good with money and details.  She will be happier if the Chinese grid includes the numbers 5 and 7. 9	Although Donna is ambitious, her ambition is tempered with humanitarian ideals. [The Arrow of Willpower: The numbers 1, 5 and 9]   Donna is somewhat stubborn and very determined.  Holding strong opinions that she will voice without reservation, she will nevertheless reach her goals through persistent hard work

       Well..next semester, our spring semester (which is more like a summer semester) is from May to August (so from May 3rd to August 6th)...my schedule runs: Monday: work from 8am - 6pm; class from 6-9pm Tuesday: work from 8am - 6pm; class from 6-9pm Wednesday: work from 8am - 5pm Thursday: work from 8am - 6pm; clinic class from 6-9:30pm Friday: work from 8am - 1pm; class from 1-5pm; work from 5-6pm; class from 6-9pm (so much for enjoying my Fridays...*sniff*) Saturday: class from 9am - 12pm  Just looking at that makes me sad but I guess in the long run, it'll be worth it, I guess.....I'm just tired and sad looking at it right now.

       I can't explain it.  I just feel so damn drained.  I don't want to talk to anyone.  I don't want to see anyone.  My body feels like crap.  My mind feels even more like crap.  My stomach is growling but I'm too tired and too lazy to make myself any food.  I've been at work for 13+ hours.  And after seeing next semester's schedule - that doesn't make me feel any better at all.  It just makes me feel tired looking at it.  I don't know what happened.  I just feel like ...zilch.  I feel emotionally empty.  I feel mentally drained - so much that it hurts and I just have this pounding headache.  And physically?  Physically - lemme see - my joints hurt...it's raining again - at least, it's snowing like it was a couple of days ago...my shoulders and neck are cramping again and spasming.  I wish that I could go in for a treatment but I can't - I'm just so busy.  Busy busy busy.  Dang.  I'm trying not to cuss.  I'm really trying to be good.  You know how sometimes, you start acting more and more not like the way you used to be.  I know that it's a good thing to change and grow but some changes - I just don't like them about me.  I miss certain things about the old me.  But there are things that I knowt hat I've changed that are for the better.  But I miss how I was so much stronger back then in the sense that I could just do it without complaining and wihtout whining and without stressing.  I just handled it.  I used to excel.  I hate it when I don't excel - I hate it when I feel like I'm just doing average.  and life goes on.....

       Wow - three years since I started blogging...I used to blog on my website via geocities but sadly enough, geocities shut me down.  I really need to my butt in action about some other stuff of mine - I've beens of the whole website scene.  My poor site name redirects to my xanga site which isn't too exciting.  Lemme see - update on me.  Yesterday was busy busy busy..but luckily Kuan saved me from a crazy day at work and took me home for some good loving *^_^* and then, Leng, me, and Kuan met up with Bindu at the Indian Standard Restaurant for their $8 all you can eat buffet.  The food was really filling and pretty good - yummy samosas!  :-)  Other than that, I came home and just chilled online and did some anatomy homework.  Pretty simple and basic - not too much drama which is good. I'm dreading the 20th when the paternal grandparents are back in town (refer back to three years ago when they came to visit)...  More on that another day.  I need to get back to another busy day at work.

       Numbnutz7LPhiE (11:33:39 PM): Hey babe.  I don't mean to be short with you on the phone but I'm just tired.  Love you.  G'night.. *sigh* even more...  ere once was this guy who was very much in love  with his girl...  This ROMANTIC GUY folded 1,000 pieces of paper  cranes as a gift to his girl...  Although, at that time he was just a small fry  in his company and his future didn't seem too  bright, they were very happy together...  Until one day, his girl told him she was going  to Paris and will never come back. She also told  him that she couldn't visualize any future for  the both of them, so they went their own ways  there and then...  Heartbroken, the guy agreed. But when he regained  his confidence, he worked hard day and night,  slogging his body and mind just to make  something out of him....  Finally with all this hard work and the help of  friends, this guy had set up his own company!  You never fail until you stop trying.  One rainy day, while he was driving, he  saw an elderly couple sharing an umbrella the  rain walking to some destination.  Even with the umbrella, they were still  drenched. It didn't take him long to realize  they were his ex-girlfriend's parents...  With a heart in getting back at them, he drove  slowly beside the couple, wanting them to spot  him in his luxury sedan...  He wanted them to know that he wasn't the same  anymore; he had his own company, car, condo, etc.  He made it!  Before the guy could realize, the couple was  walking towards a cemetery, and he got out of  his car and followed...  and he saw his girl, a photograph of her smiling  sweetly as ever at him from her tombstone and he  saw his paper cranes beside her...  Her parents saw him. He asked them why had this  happened. They explained, she did not leave for  Paris at all...  She was ill with cancer...  She had believed he would make it someday,  but she did not want to be his obstacle!!...  therefore she had chosen to leave him.   Just because someone doesn't love you the way  you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love  you with all they have. She had wanted her  parents to put his paper cranes beside her,  because, if the day comes when fate brings him  to her again...  he can take some of those back with him..   Once you have loved, you will always love... For what's in your mind may escape  but what's in your heart will remain forever...  The guy just wept...   The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting  right beside them knowing you can't have  them.....  hope you would understand...   Find time to realize that there is one person  who means so much to you, for you might wake up  one morning losing that person whom you thought  meant nothing to you...

Just put in the detergent section and run a cycle, it will also clean a toilet. (Wow, and we drink this stuff) 19.  Kool Aid can be used as a dye in paint also Kool Aid in Dannon plain yogurt as a finger paint, your kids will love it and it won't hurt them if they eat it! 20.  Peanut butter - will get scratches out of CD's!  Wipe off with a coffee filter paper21.  Sticking bicycle chain - Pam no-stick cooking spray 22.  Pam will also remove paint, and grease from your hands!  Keep a can in your garage for your hubby 23.  Peanut butter will remove ink from the face of dolls 24.  When the doll clothes are hard to put on, sprinkle with corn starch and watch them slide on 25.  Heavy dandruff - pour on the vinegar! 26.  Body paint - Crisco mixed with food coloring.  Heat the Crisco in the microwave, pour in to an empty film container and mix with the food color of your choice! 27.  Tie Dye T-shirt - mix a solution of Kool Aid in a container, tie a rubber band around a section of the T-shirt and soak 28.  Preserving a newspaper clipping - large bottle of club soda and cup of milk of magnesia, soak for 20 min. and let dry, will last f or many years! 29.  A Slinky will hold toast and CD's! 30.  To keep goggles and glasses from fogging, coat with Colgate toothpaste 31.  Wine stains, pour on the Morton salt and watch it absorb into the salt. 32.  To remove wax - Take a paper towel and iron it over the wax stain, it will absorb into the towel. 33.  Remove labels off glassware etc. rub with Peanut butter! 34.  Baked on food - fill container with water, get a Bounce paper softener and the static from the Bounce towel will cause the baked on food to adhere to it.  Soak overnight.  Also; you can use 2 Efferdent tablets, soak overnight! 35.  Crayon on the wall - Colgate toothpaste and brush it! 36.  Dirty grout - Listerine37.  Stains on clothes - Colgate38.  Grass stains - Karo Syrup39.  Grease Stains - Coca Cola, it will also remove grease stains from the driveway overnight.  We know it will take corrosion from car batteries! 40.  Fleas in your carpet?  20 Mule Team Borax- sprinkle and let stand for 24 hours.  Maybe this will work if you get them back again. 41.  To keep FRESH FLOWERS longer Add a little Clorox, or 2 Bayer aspirin, or just use 7-up instead of water. 42.  When you go to buy bread in the grocery store, have you ever wondered which is the freshest, so you "squeeze" for freshness or softness?  Did you know that bread is delivered fresh to the stores five days a week?  Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  Each day has a different color twist tie.  They are: Monday = Blue,  Tuesday = Green, Thursday = Red, Friday = White and Saturday = Yellow.  So if today was Thursday, you would want red twist tie; not white which is Fridays (almost a week old)!  The colors go alphabetically by color Blue- Green - Red - White - Yellow, Monday through Saturday.  Very easy to remember. I thought this was interesting.  I looked in the grocery store and the bread wrappers DO have different twist ties, and even the ones with the plastic clips have different colors.  You learn something new everyday!  Enjoy fresh bread when you buy bread with the right color on the day you are shopping.

       So, I went running this morning - I dunno - it's 6:57am...and I odn't know why I woke up so early - I felt so shitty last night...  And on my run, I was thinking of all these things...from Grace and Josh's breakup to my own relationship to my parents.  I thought about my moving situation and I thought about my career.  And sadly enough, after 20 minutes of jogging along, I started to huff and puff - definately NOT good.  I barely barely made it home.  I was huffing and puffing and my shins and knees felt all weak and crappy.  I must start working out more now that the weather is finally getting better.  On top of that, I'm going back to my morning routine of crunches and pushups.  *sigh*

       Does anything scare you?  Sometimes, I get scared but I don't want people to know that I'm scared.  So, I bottle it up inside and smile as if the world is alright.  I try to focus on the positive and I'd rather be happy for other people than stress or worry about my fears.  Stupid, sometimes - yes.  Unrealistic - yes.  I know that nothing comes easily and everything has a price to pay.  Sometimes, I just don't know where the line is anymore...between sacrifice and just too darn much.  How far does loyalty go?  Are you willing to do something even if you don't want to - or you're sacrificing your happiness on behalf of your loyalty.  Which would you rather do?  Follow your heart?  Or remain loyal?  Loyalty in this sense...means...obedience.

       So, I had this CRAZY day at work...super super busy on top of an open house last night - afterwards, I got out of work at 9:30pm.....I headed over to Gamekeepers to meet up with my biggie Leng, Bindu, and Nette for some food, BEER, and BASKETBALL...okay, quick update on my brackets...  Manhatten vs Florida 75-60 (WHAT A CRAZY game...the underdogs took it all - DAYAM) Charlotte vs Texas Tech 73-76 (yay!) UTEP vs Maryland 83-86 (yay Terps!) Virgina Commonwealth vs Wake Forest 78-79 (yay but the game was so close that it nearly gave me a heartattack) SIU vs Alabama 64-65 (dayam...*sniff* it was a close game and I was trying to maintain composure during one of my interviews while sneaking a peak at the scores on www.sportsline.com) Liberty vs St. Joe's 63-82 (talk about getting whupped - WHUPISH!!  yay St.Joe's!) Brigham Young vs Syracuse 75-80 (yay!!) Texas-San Antonio vs Stanford 45-71 (yay Cali!) Alabama State vs Duke 61-96 (yay!) Vermont vs UConn 53 - 70 (yay!) Texas vs Princeton 49-66 (yay!)

Air Force vs North Carolina 52-63 (Go tarheels!!  yay!!) Valparaiso vs Gonzaga 49-76 (yay!)  So, I guess that I'm doing okay on my brackets...but overall, the craziness continues...heehee!!!

       So, on top of feeling drained, my boss - my COO, Jenn Park is trying to drag me along this Saturday...I'm telling a lot of my friends that I can't do anything on Saturday because I'm doing something for my boss.  It's true...sorta...she's dragging me along to the tryouts for Apprentice 2.  Honestly, I have no chance and I'm just doing it for the hell of it.  She's a 28 year old who is COO of an entire college and she pretty much runs everything and makes all the decisions

       When will my days end?  Well, last night - I was fortunate enough that Kuan picked me up from work but we were trying to conduct some business and he was trying to sign me up for a new insurance plan but I ended up falling asleep and somewhat responding to him.  I felt so shitty and so tired.  My body just completely gave up on me.  I don't know what else to say..it just wanted a break and it was only 9:30pm when I got home from class since he picked me up.  *sigh*  To make things even worse...I didn't get my tax return yet.  They promised me that it'd be in my account by today.  ARGH.  :(  I"m starting to stress - if I don't get it tomorrow, it's really going to set me back.  I was counting on this money for my move next weekend.  ARGH!  I'm trying to tell myself to take a deep breath and everything will work out for the best.

       Sometimes, I feel like I have to do certain things to make other people happy.  No, it's not like someone has put a gun to my head and is forcing me to do anything...it's just...I feel like I'm doing something that isn't in my best interest just to make someone else happy.  And that feeling just sucks cuz now, I'm feeling kinda bitter and really really worn out.  Work has been super busy.  I feel like I can barely breathe and tomorrow is going to be non-stop CRAZY.  I'm not even so sure that it's work - it's a couple other things, too.  Work just has me running around like crazy.  Throw in school and I'm tired....throw in other stuff, and when it comes down to it, I'm not so sure if I want to deal with it.  I'm so....drained....and eventually, I'll burn out or I'll just be empty.

       Where to start... Well - a huge CONGRATS to my baby lil brother Steve John Jr. Wang - for winning the Southern Calfiornia Regional Spelling Bee and taking home $5,000 - dayam!!  For a little 10 year old, not bad at all, lil bro ;-)  I played Texas Hold 'Em with the Lambdas at UIUC on Friday night...let's just say when the night was over - I felt like I was on top of the world..  And to add to my gambling addiction...MARCH MADNESS!!  Woohoo - I'm already in four pools and I'm still hesitant and don't have a defnite yet.  Maybe one more pool and another bracket will reassure my feelings....BTW - if you want to join my sportsline pool, leave me eprops and a comment and your email address so I add you into my pool....heehee...if you can't find me - I will be in your local sports bar with my beer watching some basketball until April 5th.  :-)

       I know..I know.. I shouldn't be slightly insecure but I am feeling that way.  The new girl starts today at PCOM - her name is Katie and that's about as much as I know about her.  I think that she's older than me and I know that everyone says that age shouldn't be a factor.  But I will be the youngest one in that office and I'll be the "Senior member" which kinda puts me at slight unease.  I just hope that adjusting to her will be okay.  As long as she's not another Larry - we should be fine.  I'm a little nervous and slightly jealous that she gets to travel to San Diego for training but it makes a lot of sense.  Larry should have been able to train me but he just didn't do that great of a job.  *sigh*  Other than that, fingers crossed for today to run smoothly.

       It's raining again...I went out with Leng tonight to Zentra and when we left, we were running in the rain and cold to her car...I was checking my voicemail and I got a voicemail from a guy from my past...  He said "It's raining here and it made me think of you.  Sometimes, rain makes a person sad but for me, rain reminds me of you and how happy it made you.  And how we went through things together and it makes me miss you."  Now, when it rains....I feel differently.  I used to feel horny when it rained.  I used to love the way the air smelled after it rained.  I used to love going running in the rain.  Sometimes, when I came home and it was raining, I'd just change and go sprinting through the rain.  I don't know where it started becoming less and less..maybe three years ago with Duy and I got hit by that one car...or maybe it was when I was in the car with this one guy and his car spun out...I don't know.  I don't get happy anymore from the rain.  Maybe it's just old age getting to me.  I don't know.  I really don't.

       What is love? When we claim that it's love that  we have for someone, are we correct?  Here some things to ponder upon.....  ** Are your palms sweaty, is your heart racing  and is your voice is caught in your chest?  It isn't love; it's like.  ** You can't keep your eyes or hands off of him,  am I right?  It isn't love; it's lust.  ** Are you proud, and eager to show him off?  It isn't love; it's luck.  ** Do you want him because you know they're  there?  It isn't love; it's loneliness.  ** Are you there because it's what everyone  wants?  It isn't love; it's loyalty.  ** Are you there because he kissed you, or held  your hand?  It isn't love; it's low confidence.  ** Do you stay for their confessions of love,  because you don't want to hurt him?  It isn't love; it's pity.  ** Do you belong to him because his sight makes  your heart skip a beat?  It isn't love; it's infatuation.  ** Do you pardon his faults because you care  about him?  It isn't love; it's friendship.  ** Do you tell him every day he's the only one  you think of?  It isn't love; it's a lie.  ** Are you willing to give all of your favorite  things for his sake?  It isn't love; it's charity.  ** Does your heart ache and break when he's sad?  Then it's love.  ** Do you cry for their pain, even when he's  strong?  Then it's love.  ** Do his eyes see your true heart, and touch  your soul so deeply it hurts?  Then it's love. ** Do you stay because a blinding,  incomprehensible mix of pain and relation pulls  you close and holds you there?  Then it's love.  ** Do you accept his faults because they're a  part of who he is?  Then it's love.  ** Are you attracted to others, but stay with him  faithfully without regret?  Then it's love.  ** Would you allow him to leave you, not because  he wants to but because he has to?  Then it's love.  ** Would you give him your heart, your life, your  death?  Then it's love.  Now, if love is painful, and tortures us so, why  do we love? Why is it all we search for in life?  This pain, this agony? Why is it all we long for?  This torture, this powerful death of self? Why?  The answer is so simple cause it's...LOVE.  It is so addictive that even people who are not  having it wish to experience and share it with  someone. That's what God gave us, love.

       So, I finally get around to reading ppl's xanga sites and I come across big Bro Cliff's page..heehee...sometimes, I swear - he's got so much time on his hands...jk!  But Just wanted to share this one with you...I think that I'll use it sometime.  :)  Ever gone to a club... and some freaking annoying person ask for your number???  Well... instead of rejecting him... trying give him/her the following.....  (310)495-5412  It's an actual rejection line... .  When the person dialed that number.. he or she will hear this nice calming voice telling him or her that they've been rejected! It's freaking hilarious... :)   It's not one of those numbers that will charge you unless you don't have any more free minutes on your cell phone.... Have fun with it!!!  (thanks big bro!)

       All of my teams won last night - WOOHOO!! Yay for Oklahoma cowboys, especially!!  And St.Joe's! (Kuan has them going to the Championships...but I have Okie beating them out next game)...yay for UConN!!  And yay for Alabama - who would have guessed it?!  But yay for them!!!  I have them going to the final four..hahah..wishful thinking, eh?  Oh, well..It's POURING rain outside and I have no desire to get up to go to work, BUT I do know that there is some money waiting to be made for me.  I'll prolly get my butt and at 'em in about another 15 minutes.  I woke up this morning to the plip plop of rain on my skylight - yeah, I dunno about having skylights when I buy my own place.  True, it really does save you on electricity and heat but the summers are practically unbearable unless you have a window, too.  Anyway...I worked out last night - went running before the crazy rains...and this morning, I did my usual crunches (110 to the front...60 to the right side and 60 to the left side), my pushups, my ab roller thingy for 11 minutes and then, I showered and crawled right back into bed.  I always worry about Leng waking up in the middle of my little workout and giving me a funny look.  It still surprises me that she hasn't done that yet.  Oh, well.  I kinda wish that I went out with them last night to the Apartment but I also know how tired I am..plus I really wanted to watch my basketball games...and I also had homework to do and stuff to study for in Anatomy.  *sigh*

       It's raining/drizzling here in Chicago.. and rain always makes me think.  *sigh*  It makes me think of my life... Do I see a career with PCOM? I see flexibility...opportunity to grow and change and advance upwards.. *note: they updated our PCOM website and they put down that I'm the Senior Admissions Counselor....guess that promotion is real...even though it's just title only for now...must prove them wrong *I have been putting 100% of me into this job.  Maybe it's time to up it a notch and put in 110% to really bring in the numbers for Spring 2004 semester. *which reminds me...I have to do my case study for my OM class (Oriental Medicine) and prep for my final...on top of my Anatomy final (cuz if you don't get a C+ or higher, you have to repeat this class..which makes sense - would you want your masseuse or doctor to not have passed his/her classes with flying colors?)  Do I see a future with Kuan?  One where I'm willing to disobey my mother and grandparents and follow my heart? *I do...it scares the heck out of me.  I actually see something - he'll be the first guy that I truly admit that of.  I can see so much that it scares me.  A future with him is something beyond what I even dreamed.  I never thought that I could feel so much...ever. *One step at a time though..one breath in and one breath out..I wish that I could say that I'm just in the present...and the scary thing is...I am solely in the present and a part of me is unwilling to move forward and dare to dream about the future.  Prolly from all the pressure for the future..ugh  What will happen will happen.  Last night, I got to hang out with a high school buddy/associate of mine - Albert Wu, and it's interesting catching up with people.  It's a weird feeling knowing that we're all growing up and we have different thoughts and feelings.  But definately nice catching up with each other and learning about what's been going on in each other's lives.  It's weird recounting my life since I moved to Chicago...lemme see....  I took my last final on Friday..moved from SB (thanks to Annie) to PVE...went out to dinner with my friends and Grace...Saturday - had one last meal wtih the family...flew out to Chicago...Leng picked me up and we went to a CST party...Lyndsey and Christina woke me up Sunday morning to do community service at freaking 6am (4am my time) and then...Monday, i started working at NCSA...so crazy....  And December 2002, Kuan and I started dating...I continued work with NCSA - took courses at UIC Spring 2003....moved to my current location..finally and utterly fell in love with Kuan (July 4, 2003) ...in October 2003, I quit NCSA on the 15th and that weekend, I saw my first grand lil cross and charter KDPhi at Purdue...started up at PCOM...Kuan and I had officially gone through our ups and downs..prolly the worst of our downs...and now - 2004?  still with the same guy and moving once again - hopefully the last of all of my moves for a while....and still at PCOM.

       Lady Gauchos enter the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Division 1 Basketball Championship after a 56-52 upset over Houston Monday night. Center Lindsay Taylor tallied 20 points and 10 rebounds.   Next game is Saturday, March 27th when the Lady Gauchos play either second-seeded Connecticut or seventh-seeded Auburn in the East Regional semifinals in Hartford, Connecticut. Check out the game on ESPN.  "The biggest secret is that these kids have put in unbelievable running and practice over this year. We were just bound and determined this year. We have worked really hard and pretty consistently and made taking care of the ball a major issue."                                                                                     Mark French, Head Coach   For more information go to http://ucsbgauchos.ocsn.com/sports/w-baskbl/recaps/032204aaa.html or http://espn.go.com/  GO GAUCHOS!

       So, I'm bored at work..  Well, I was talking to Beth and she decided to see if her past said anything about her...and I told her - I have a past - I have a crazy list of past guys...which isn't really fair but just to humor her, I said that I'd list them out and the lessons that I learned from each one..some people, I'd rather not say their name but I'll put their initial.  Just because I list them does not mean that they were once my boyfriend.  They are all guys that I have been 'romantically' involved with...which may mean nothing more than just a weekend 'fling' or a period of 'talking/flirting' or an actual relationship.  David Shih - I learned that my preschool crush could become my first boyfriend...but nothing else besides the title - I was like 10 years old  :-P  Eddie Lee - I learned that just cuz you get along well with someone, he doesn't have to be your boyfriend, he can just be a really great friend.  My first kiss was with him: July 4th, 1994.  And sometimes, that kind of love is the kind that lasts forever.  RIP Edward Lin Lee 4.4.1978 - 1.18.2000....  Dan Kobylarcik - I learned that when you're in junior high, you're way too young to hope that your 8th grade boyfriend will want to stay with you going to separate high schools.  Dan Finn - I learned that when you're 14 years old, you don't want to try and have a long distance relationship - especially with Chicago and California.  Leo Tsai - I learned that at the age of 14, I was scared off by the word "love" - he wrote me a love letter calling me his love and that was only after 1 week after he asked me out  Kenny Finley - I learned that at the age of 14, it is too hard to have a long distance relationship between Georgia and California even though you met 'romantically' in Tahoe and not getting kissed by the last four guys that you've been in relationships with sucks.  :-P  Matt Wilson - Interesting story...and random lessons.  I learned that sometimes, you're just too young to know what's good for you and the thin line between sacrifice and letting someone walk all over you...  Kent Hu - I learned that sometimes, the timing just isn't right.  Jimm Lee - I learned that Money isn't everything.  Patrick Chang - I learned so much...I learned that the right guy will sacrifice for you and you will sacrifice for him.  I learned that age does matter sometimes and sometimes, it doesn't.  I learned that some long distance relationships are worth it.  I learned that the best way to love someone is to let them go.....  I learned a lot and no regrets...  Will Le - I learned that it's okay not to be over my ex but I also learned that you need to take that time to be by yourself.  I also learned that if you're not comfortable with someone and they start to push you, it's okay to say no and to walk away from it.  I learned what it was like to be with someone in college.  A. - I learned that I didn't want to be a guy's first kiss and his first girlfriend...especially long distance.  N. - I learned that karma will come back and hit you hard.  I learned that it sucks being the guy's rebound after his girlfriend.  Duy Dinh - I learned that money cannot buy everything.  I learned that innocence is only savored in the moment and you look back in the past and you regret it.  I learned that sometimes, emotions will drive you to say and do things that you do not truly mean.  M. and R. - From these two, I learned how to have a simple fling and leave them emotionless and not wanting more from the guy.  Joseph Dejvejprasit - I learned that when a guy is confused and not willing to be fully honest, it's time to leave.  I learned more deception and I learned that a guy can treat you so amazingly well but still be deceiving you.  I learned that there is something wrong when a guy does not believe in titles.  E. - I learned that if I'm not ready to be in a relationship or there is hesitance, it's wrong to continue.  I learned that I should be honest to myself and my heart.  I learned that if the timing is wrong and the guy seems right, don't do it.  I ended up hurting someone that I never wanted to hurt and I lost a good friend.  Dwight Lin - I learned that not everyone will be understanding and willing to try to understand.  I learned that if the timing is wrong and the guy is right, don't do it.  You're just not ready and it's not fair to him.  Brody Martin - I learned that I should not settle.  And if something seems wrong from the very beginning, it usually is wrong.  F. - I learned how to have a long distance fling.  And I learned not to trust alcohol spoken words.  Kuan-Ren Su - I learned how to love again...how to trust someone so much that I know that he holds my soul, heart, and future in his hands...  I learned that it's okay to not rush things and take your time.  I learned how to truly love before I even told him that I loved him.  I learned that actions speak louder than words.  I learned how to laugh and become a kid again and I learned how to be a mature woman ready to move forward.  I learned that when you meet someone that feels right at the right timing, it is right.  When I'm fully whole again, it's just right again.  I learned how to roll with the punches and how to go up and down the roller coaster with someone - my own personal roller coaster.  I learned that we don't fight because we're both mature reasonable people that can discuss our differences and work things out. I am still learning....

Anyway....I'm at work...boo..I have FIVE appointments today for work which should be a good thing but I keep on looking outside and wanting to be outside.  other than that..life goes on.  I'm a bit miffed and annoyed at the people who keep on asking me if I'm going to GenAPA - NO, I have finals next week and I have to work on Saturday - what part of that implies that I'm going to Michigan...sheesh.  Man..I have to work three Saturdays in a row.  *sigh*

       warning: LONG entry ahead I really don’t know where to even begin.  I haven’t blogged because I haven’t had internet connection. Saturday: woke up; finished up most of my packing…watched basketball – saw the Uconn/UCSB Women’s Game – that was just pure craziness.  April McDivett sure is something.  She’s this little dynamo that scored 20 points…5 3-pointers…dunno how many turnovers she caused by stealing the ball – incredible shooter and point guard and an aggressive speedy demon.  Just amazing – plus she was cute.  Because, after all, Diana Taurasi from UCOnn was pretty good, too – with 21 points and she was their offensive system.  But she wasn’t all that to look at so April was my eye candy.  Richardson from UCSB was pretty cute, too and she was nailing most of her shots.  Mann just kinda pissed me off cuz she was missing all these really easy shots.  The first half was super exciting because UCSB was actually leading UCOnn – how awesome is that?  The lowest seeded school up against the two time reigning champion of Women’s basketball….just awesome.  In the end they lost, but I’m super proud to be a Gaucho.  Well…after I was watching the game (rather, during the game), Kuan and his siblings, Vince and Debbie, showed up with the Uhaul truck and we moved all my stuff out and about.  It really helped having four people.  It was a seamless and painless deal.  J  Moving seemed to go by so much more quickly and it was more enjoyable.  After the move, we all headed over to Buca Di Beppo’s for dinner – yum!  Speaking of Buca’s, I was talking to Robert, and he said that PV Drive and PCH has a Buca’s…that’s freaking like 5 minutes away from my family’s house in Cali..so crazy.  *^_^*  Sunday: For some reason…I woke up at 4am..unpacked my kitchen stuff – washed all my dishes and glasses…  Next, I tackled the bathroom and unpacked all of that stuff.  Then, I tackled my closet..  And then, I tackled the living room stuff.  By 8am, I was completely unpacked and for the most part, all moved in.  Amazing, huh?  I went out for a beautiful run along Sheridan and after half a mile, I realized that it merges with Lake Shore Drive.  It was just simply gorgeous.  I came home to shower and realized that I didn’t have a shower curtain.  I debated on going to the store just for that darn curtain but instead, after seeing the outrageous prices, I decided to go to the dollar store on Milwaukee (which is nearby my old house)….  I hopped on the train at 10am and went down to the area, I hit up Kmart but once again, after seeing their rip off prices, I was very very turned off.  So, I just hit up the dollar store and what deals I got there.  For example, I got this kitchen set – with the dish rack and the thingy underneath it to drain, a utensil thing, and a soap dispenser for only $3.99 (that same thing at Kmart was freaking $7+ and that was just for the dish rack thingy and the utensil thing was $2.75+)  Anyway, at the dollar store, I got all this stuff…I got this shower set – toothbrush holder, cup, soap dispenser, and shower curtain for only $6; I also got like 40 hangers for $4; I picked up a couple sponges and random stuff.  Then, I hit up Kmart and I had to get a big trashcan for my kitchen, the Brita pitcher refills (that itself was like $18), bathroom rug – I’ve decided to make my bathroom mostly blue and cream colored.  *^_^*  Then, I hit up my old place so I could get my Brita filter and also the Upass that I had left back there, including my H&M coat, too.  It kinda made me a little sad going in and seeing how empty it all was.  But life moves on and I ended up just hopping on the Ashland bus to the Diversey bus to head home.  The Diversey bus ended up taking me only 4 blocks away from home.  When I finally got home, I finally got to shower which felt really really really good.  J  The water pressure at my new place is pretty strong.  Anyway, I realized how hungry I was…so I went grocery shopping.  I am sorely disappointed in Dominick’s and am determined to only shop at Jewel/Osco and hopefully whenever Treasure Island is safe to shop again, I will be there.  The Treasure Island story is for another day – I don’t want to get sidetracked.  Then, I just spent the rest of the day on the 16th floor enjoying the gorgeous 60 degree weather and reading books.  I ended up making myself dinner and working on some excel spreadsheets.  I realized how much I miss the Internet and btw, my cell phone reception isn’t the best in my new apartment so I am seriously considering getting a LAN line now.  We’ll see, I guess.  Finally, at 9:45pm, I just conked out..after being awake since 4am, my body just kinda gave out plus the rain’s pitter patter kinda put me to sleep, too.  Monday:  I woke up at 6am and went running.  Beautiful – just gorgeous.  The air had that fresh smell to it since it had just rained.  I made myself breakfast and headed to work at 7:50am and got there by 8:05am.  So impressed with the timing that I made.  *^_^*  However, yesterday at work was very very crazy.  I had all these appointments and just found myself swamped with all of this work.  I feel bad about one of my appointments – I was supposed to give her a tour of the campus but I never got around to it, I just had to step outside for lunch.  L  Oh, well – hopefully she’ll understand – I’ll shoot her an email or call her up.  Anyway, I had class and for home, I just hopped on the Sheridan bus and I was home within a couple of minutes – so convenient!  And I love how the bus stop is right outside my front door.  I had a weird dream and I guess that I’ll talk about it later – this entry is long enough as it is.  I guess that is what I get when I haven’t written in a while.

       First day of Annie & Jin in the City :-P Kuan and I picked them up in the early morning...took them back to my place while they got the short tour of my pad...and then, I took them upstairs to see the pretty view from the 16th floor...then, we hit up Einstein's Bagels for breakfast... I went to work..and they went back to my place to sleep.  After a long day at work..I couldn't leave until 4:15pm.  *sniff*  I met up wtih the girls at Chipotle for a late lunch....*yum*  Then, we had to run a kdphi/lambda errand which took us nearby my old house - I'm gonna miss that location...and my roommates, too..but it's a sign that I'm growing up :-P  Afterwards, we hit up the alumnae wings night...YUMMY and I'm surprised how many other people showed up but it was good - definately good.  :-)  The girls ran across the street for some ice-cream afterwards...and then, we hit up the Apartment for some dancing :-p  Pictures to follow.  *^_^*  And then, when we got back to my place, we chit chatted and did some girly gossiping until we fell asleep.  *sigh*  Definately good times...and more to come!

       *sigh*  As tempted as I am to leave early from work...I've finished most of my stuff for today and I'm just waiting on some students to come in for their interview with the academic dean...  I just want to go home.  Annie and Jin are waiting for me at home.  It's their first time in Chicago and I want to take them downtown to Michigan Avenue to do some shopping but I know that I need to stay and take care of some stuff.  I'm really really hoping that my boss will let me leave a bit early.  I've got work on Saturday for three weekends in a row.  Responsibility is tough.  Especially when you're older and you know that you have obligations and you have a career, not just a job on the line.  *sigh*  If this was my other job, and as long as it wasn't payroll or commissions, I would be so gone.  But I do care about this job, hence I'm staying put and trying to force myself to be patient and realistic and RESPONSIBLE.  On top of that, my stomach is growling and I haven't eaten anything in a while....I made breakfast for Kuan and me but that's about it.  I'm hungry hungry hungry!!!  :(

       HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ANNIE CAMEY KUO!!!  :-) I can't wait to see you tomorrow...I'll make Kuan wake up early to pick up you and Jin at 6:30am while I sleep in (isn't that what Lambdas are for anyway?  :grin:) and now for a trip down memory lane (picture intensive)..from meeting you through "Stanford ways"       from our random days back in 2001...     to outdrinking silly frat boys who think that they can hang...     to chopping off our hair (well, that was also mainly Don's pushing me to cut it...and I had to - otherwise, she would take scissors to my hair!)     I may take this picture down..it's one of those random fobby shots...           And see those two hot girls on the sides of Don - they're coming to see me tomorrow!! And to Annie - I can't wait to see you...through everything, you've been an amazing pillar of support...I remember when I was ready to stop after the summer and it was YOU who said "You can't go...we...I need you" and I decided to stay a little bit longer - who would have known that your dream of kdphi on the UCSB campus would have actually happened...through all of our Asian Am classes and English classes and oh, yeah that one Chinese film where I always slept and Don and you would bring food to class :-P we managed to BS our way through and earn our BA ;-) and the KW Lee class where it was a struggle to wake up early just to make it to class on time.  You held my hand through a lot of the stormy times, especially when I struggled as the new vp internal.  :-P  Remember that drive to Santa Cruz - I cannot believe that we listened to Dixie Chicks up there...and it was SCARY driving there, too and we were driving in the middle of the road in all that fog...to living together for that brief while during the summer.  :-P  I'd go on and on with our memories but I'll stop now and I'd rather reminisce when you get here in Chicago - you and Jin have a safe flight over and make sure that you get some sleep on that red-eye, too!!  And of course, happy 23rd birthday!!

They've been charging me for the past four months and I tried to refute it and she requested that I fax everything in and I tried to and realized that she gave me a bogus fax number.  I'm so pissed off right now.  I need to go and yell at someone.  ARGH!!!!

       Well...I can't seem to remember what I did this weekend...I cleaned up my new place - pics coming soon...I studied a lot for Anatomy and Physiology (final this Wednesay)...and I studied for Oriental Medicine (thanks to the bf for being my case study for my final project)...I worked on Saturday from 8am - 4pm...went to Chicago Kollaboration (pics to come soon) to see my twin and the other hot NU Lambda (Zeta class) dance...got to chill with two of my nephews (Roland and Brian) and see two of my niceces.  I guess - good things come in pairs.  ;-)  And I got two wonderful personal letters this weekend, too!  Speaking of two - welcome and congrats to the newest KDPhis - Michigan State University's Zeta Class: Roshni Patel and Lily Yang.  And a huge congrats to their Momma Jenny Yang.  I'll have pictures up, as well - we're looking for new tenants for our old location.  And please, no one mention the NCAA Tournament....I can't believe that GA Tech won...and I can't believe how close the games were...so...I guess I"m rooting for UConn.  Yesterday - I got to hang out with my Auntie Bindu and we did a bomb-diggity job cleaning up our old place...man, I'm going to miss our little 1655 N.Paulina house.  :-P  At Kollaboration, it made me think how the Asian American awareness scene in Chicago just isn't what it is in California.  I complained about Santa Barbara and how frustrating it was to get awareness and unity going.  I didn't realize that Chicago would be even harder.  I was blessed getting a chance to take TWO classes with the famous K.W. Lee and get my minor in Asian American Studies.  It made me think of how when Kuan and I went to the premier of Robot Stories here in Chicago - the theatre was so empty and maybe a handful of people were there to meet Karin and see the film.....just thoughts.  :-P  Living alone makes me think a lot.  Don't know if that's a good thing or not.  So, goodbye for now - you'll see me again on Wednesday, after my two finals (but I still have a final project that isn't due until next Tuesday) and hopefully the darn RCN guy will fix my internet so I can be up and running and actually do some real Internet stuff!!!  :-P  PS: Annie and Jin come on Thursday morning!!  WOOHOO - if you're not doing anything that night, come out to Gamekeepers at 6:30pm for some ten cent wings and some fun!!  ;-)  We'll probably be there for 2-3 hours cuz KDPhis can eat!!

       Well..last weekend when Jin and Annie were here, it was a nice 35-40 degrees.  Somehow, within that one week...on Friday, it was a blistering 81 degrees..dayam!!  And somehow, work has their AC and heat on..silly people.  :-)  But overall, I am glad that Chicago has four seasons unlike California's two seasons: rain and no rain.  It's 6:30am...and the boyfriend is sleeping over.  He's blissfully passed out and I can't seem to sleep anymore.  Funny..yesterday, I felt like I had money to spend.  I went to Marshall Field's with an intent to buy myself a suit.  And I really was eyeing this one suit but when I tried it on, it looked funny.  No need to look funny in a suit if I'm gonna spend a couple hundred on it.  I found a cute skirt and bought it.  I decided to use the gift card that Kuan's mom gave me.  Figured that I'd still have to pay for the skirt until they told me that I have a balance on it...and then, freaking a...I didn't realize how much money was on that card.  She gave me a $150 gift card to Fields!!  Fields is like a Nordstrom/Bloomy's here in the Chicago area...I only buy like NICE quality stuff from there..and even so, it's a rarity cuz I can rarely afford it.  Now, I feel guilty and feel like I should have gotten his parents something better than the 4 month gift subscription to netflix.com - granted, yes, they do use it like crazy and Kuan always complains about how much his dad loves it..heehee...  Anyway...no suit..nothing.  :(  *sniff*  But I did get a nice skirt and I got Kuan a nice gift from H&M for his installs next weekend.  BUT we did hit up Soupbox for dinner..YUM..I had their chicken and wild rice in a breadbowl and Kuan had the beer, bacon, and cheese in a breadbowl.  Gotta love that place and for the summer, they have these yummy icey desserts, too.  *YUM*...i should nap before I really have to wake up now.  :-P  time for bed...event hough I've been up for the last three hours..

       So I'm listening to the woes of having a large active house from a friend..and it makes me appreciate UCSB KDPhis and how our house doesn't deal with such drama issues but then i think about how there's just so much pressure on us to grow and expand.  I always say quality over quantity.  I say that...I'm an alumna.  I'm not an active - I don't know how it is.  I was an active two years ago.  I can do a lot of active stuff but I'm not one.  Period.  Nor do I defend myself about it.  I'm proud to be an alumna.  I graduated and I have my own concerns and own worries.  I'm living in the real world.  It's not all that it's hyped up to be but it's all about phases in life.  I rushed my college phase and sometimes, I wish that I had more time in college, but ehh..there's nothing that I can do about it.  It's over.  And I've moved on.  And it is all about quality before quantity.  I'm going through the growing pains here at work...I saw it at my last company and I see it happening now.  All I can say is that...the more obstacles you overcome, the stronger you do become and more calm and collected and wiser.  Yes - wiser.  I'm getting older...less drama...still not as emotionally balanced as I would like myself to be but I'm slowly getting there.  Life is funny in the way that it works out.  If you'd only take the time to find the humor and smile about it.

       Enough of the mushy stuff about Kuan..  I wanted to dedicate this post to my Alpha Twins..Junko & Maggie.. these two amazing ladies have made me so happy.  We may not have the fairy tale story...we may not have the happy ending...we may not have had it easy but I am so proud of these two girls.  Throughout pledging, they gave me so much inspiration.  Spoiling was so easy.  They made it really easy to hang out with each other...easy to call them up and see how they were...easy to shop for.  :-P  My fondest memories of these two during pledgeship is eating together and supposedly studying.  The three of us can talk up a storm.  Okay, I can talk up a storm but I swear, Junko rivals me, too!  :-P  And Maggie..magster...she always put a huge smile on my face.  Every time I saw her, she would give me one of those HUGE bear hugs that you were just drowning in her boobs...jk  And online - during that summer, probably one of the hardest times...she would always im me with "YOU ROCK" and that would automatically put a smile on my face.  But those are the old days...and then, there's the whole growing phase.  I saw my two lil sis grow up.  *tear*  (That's a Maggie saying, btw)  They've really grown up, taken on responsibility, had their fair share of triumph and sorrow...and become amazing women.  Junko..has gone away from school - moved into NorCal - bought her own home...working a FT job and living the typical yuppie lifestyle.  Maggie..is finishing up school..applying for law schools...working her butt off both at work and school and still manages to find some time for her sorority.  I was talking to someone the other day and I was telling them how KDPhi is great and all, however, with certain people, I remain close to them after graduation because we've maintained a friendship..and I don't just view them as my sorority sister, they're a kindred spirit...a close friend.  And that's how I view Junko and Maggie...they're not just KDPhis to me..KDPhi is what introduced me to them and brought us closer but it's that I consider them to be a friend, too.  The KDPhi world could fall and collaspe but i would still treasure these two as my friends, too.  Junko and I talk about what kind of carpeting she should get for her new place.  I bug her to help me pick out new bed sheets for my place.  Maggie and i talk about boys and certain woes of her - I still think that she has balls of steel *wink*  In so many ways...they may be my "lil sis" but in so many ways, not only are they my equals but they are my superior...love you two..whether or not I tell you two enough.

       So, yesterday, Kuan came over and we grabbed dinner at Joy's Noodle Shop - it's like 5 blocks away from my place and the weather is gorgeous!!  :)  The food was aiight..I still don't like my Lard Na fried...but oh, well.  Their bubble tea was too creamy and I swear, I could taste the powder..the atmosphere was cute...price was pretty decent.  After just chilling for a while, he was a sweetie and took me back to my old place to pick up a few things and to do my laundry.  I realized that it wasn't worth it.  I should have just paid the $7 to do my laundry at my new place because I got cat hair all over me..sneezed a gizzillion times and coughed and hacked up a storm.  BOOO....I am never going to own a cat because I'm allergic as heck to them.  Thanks, baby, for everything...I appreciate you and love you with all of my heart.  Thanks for being there when everything looks like ...crap.

       YUM - I just had some really really good soup at the Soup Box with a friend.  He had the Lobster Bisque which was yummy and I just had the beef vegie stew.  It's like 12 different soup flavors every day and they even have bread bowls!!  I love bread bowls...yummy...you know waht I really miss?  Clam Chowder at Splash Cafe in Pismo Beach.  When Kuan and I drive down, we should stop and get some.  That'd be amazingly delish.  Anyway - yay for soupbox!!  It's only two blocks away from my place....more to come as I continue exploring my new area.

       So...this morning when I'm in discussion with my boyfriend...a bird pooped on the strap of my backpack.  Feeling incredibly grossed out, I cleaned it while complaining...  But I had to share this with someone obliged to be sympathetic... so I text messaged my boyfriend, hoping for just a scrap of sympathy. You know… nothing elaborate... just that "That's-really-lousy,-honey. I-can't-believe-that-happened-to-you." kind of sympathy. You know what he told me instead? He explained to me that having a bird poop on you is good luck.   Here's my question of the day then. In what culture is having an airborne animal defecating on your shoulder good luck? Do we say, "Hey, that's good luck!" to a person who's newly washed car is christened with bird droppings? Has anyone seen someone running around a park, neighborhood, or mall celebrating "Look, I'm a lucky guy! I've been pooped on!" lately? So, where did we get such a crazy kind of superstition? And quite frankly... does anyone believe it?

       So, I'm starving - it's 2pm and I haven't eaten since yesterday at 11:30am....26 hours of no food...  So, I go to the place right around the corner.  It's this little dinky Chinese place and when I go in, I notice the sign "No checks.  No credit cards."  But I'm starving so I don't care...I order their fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, and get an egg roll while I'm at it.  I open up the container and the entire thing is DRENCHED and drowning in sweet and sour sauce.  And it looks like the cheap stuff.  The pineapples - you can tell that you they got it from the can.  I devour the egg roll and it's purely vegetarian...boo..  I eat my fried rice...what fried rice?  It was just rice fried with soy sauce.  No eggs..no veggies..no meat.  BOO.  And then, I eat my chicken...and it's BLAH.  Never ever going there agian.

       So I woke up at 2am and couldn't sleep...I started working on some kdphi stuff....UGH.  And I tried going back to sleep but I kept on coughing.  :(  So I basically got like two hours of sleep last night... And then, I left for work and it turns out that I was locked out of my office building - I don't have the key for the big padlocks that binds our gates.  Some stupid bird pooped on my backpack...wahhh...man..this Tuesday looks like it's gonna suck big time.  And I'm still not done cleaning..I cleaned my kitchen and my bathroom and swept the floors.  Tonight, I need to clean up my closet and my living space and bed area...and mop the floors, too.  Tomorrow is my laundry day.

       I'm in the mood to write...to pour my heart out...I seem to complain lately and not really let this blog be what it's meant to be.  I used to be so good with words.  I had my manuscript...  As I start to dream,  The gentle waves tossing,  Gulls ready to scream,  Again, I peer up into the fading sun,  My eyes scanning,  for something I really don't know,  as the purple rays begin to set,  slowly and gently,  Into our Mother Earth,  The sun sinks downward,  The early, white moon peeks up,  as the sun's lingering rays disappear,  I sigh with the breath of summer,  The waves crash,  against the rocks, then they start to lash,  Just now I have to face,  I am alone,  searching for another lonely heart,  I dig my toes into the cooling sand,  My hands stretched upward,  Suddenly I sit up to wake my thoughts,  I cry,  Tears of lonliness,  Tears of sadness,  I guess I just have to face reality,  All different kinds of personality,  towards me.  I gaze toward the rolling sea,  Waves just waving,  I curl up,  in a tight ball,  just . . . pondering  not ready,  for the world yet to come   "Lady" S. Wang  7th grade English  August 1993  *I wrote this before I began junior high school, afraid of what there might be out there to offer me. I spent that summer in southern California, Ventura, to be exact and this poem just flowed itself into existence  Look at what I wrote when I was 12 years old.  1993.  That was eleven years ago...and then..  CONSUMMATION OF THE SOUL    Thudding against the wet pavement Pounding against the raindrops,  tears mingling and falling on the face  Raising the arms to the heavens  and cry . . . boldly and honestly.   Searching for that inner peace,  Wanting to find love from up above  Wanting to be really heard and understood.  Not just the words I'm saying,  but what's behind it.   Look behind the face you see upon me,  Search for the girl inside who wants to be  Hear her cries and listen . . . truly listen to her,  Do something; don't leave things as they were,  Her worst enemy is herself, all anger and fury,  You let her decide, it's already a hung jury.  Reach out . . . and hold her hand.   There is a fury unequaled in her heart,  An iron-clad chain wrapped around,  protecting her from any more real pain.  Not knowing how she's only hurting herself more  By denying Life to spring within her.   Seething in anger and self-hatred,  Blaming herself for ever trusting,  Lost within the depths of her mind,  Confused over decisions facing her.   Look behind the face you see upon me,  Search for the girl inside who wants to be  Hear her cries and listen . . . truly listen to her,  Do something; don't leave things as they were,  Her worst enemy is herself, all anger and fury,  You let her decide, it's already a hung jury.  Reach out . . . and hold her hand.   Wanting to huddle into a ball in a corner,  Hiding fromt he world her tears,  Silencing the sobs that are wrenched out,  Smiling all the while, even though  inside, she's breaking up all over again.  Fall down on her knees and ignore  her screams of desperate need of help,  her demands of where she was wronged?  People surround her and know her . . .  or do they? Is it all just an illusion?   Look behind the face you see upon me,  Search for the girl inside who wants to be  Hear her cries and listen . . . truly listen to her,  Do something; don't leave things as they were,  Her worst enemy is herself, all anger and fury,  You let her decide, it's already a hung jury.  Reach out . . . and hold her hand. Donna S. Wang     2.6.99  and what...what do I write about nowadays....nothing really...I whine. Until tonight...I have an urge to let the words just flow unbidden to my keyboard like they once used to.  I used to be able to write poetry whenever I wanted to.  I could whip out a poem a day.  And now...I wait for some inspiration.  Something that I feel as if i've lost the desire for.  Swept up in the swirling winds.. of confusion of chaos of struggle So dry...sucking all moisture from my skin All life from my soul Blood from my veins Youth from my very years  Stumbling upon that oasis a breath of fresh clean air a taste of sweet pure water protected and safe in your embrace adored and treasured by your kisses  Just when I think that I'm going to collapse exhausted, drained, apathetic  Your love is my energy one foot in front of the other... through this desert of Reality. -Donna S. Wang April 12, 2004

And then, Annie & Jin's visit to Chicago with shopping, sightseeing, and of course FOOD:             and my dirty dirty boyfriend..     Jin and me with the Su brothers     And all the shoutouts to all the KDPhis that we saw over the weekend from UIC, UPenn, Stanford, UIUC, Purdue to of course..UCSB             and then, us at the Apartment     And of course, Spring 2001 Charters...                 and somehow Jin and Annie started molesting my boyfriend..

       *^_^*  I think that the only reason that I can get away with writing so much about Kuan is because he rarely reads my online journals.  There are two songs that make me think about him...the first one is DJ Sammy's heaven (the slow version) and "Spend My Life With You" Eric Benet (feat. Tamia)  I never knew such a day could come And I never knew such a love Could be inside of one  And I never knew what my life was for But now that you're here I know for sure  I never knew till I looked in your eyes I was incomplete till the day you walked into my life And I never knew that my heart could feel So precious and pure One love so real  Can I just see you every morning when I open my eyes Can I just feel your heart beating beside me Every night Can we just feel this way together Till the end of all time Can I just spend my life with you  Now baby the days and the weeks And the years will roll by But nothing will change the love inside Of you and I  And baby I'll never find any words That could explain Just how much my heart my life My soul you've changed  Can you run to these open arms When no one else understands Can we tell God and the whole world I'm your woman, and you're my man Can't you just feel how much I love you With one touch of my hand Can I just spend my life with you  No touch has ever felt so wonderful (You are incredible) And a deeper love I've never known (I'll never let you go) I swear this love is true (Now and forever to youto you) Can I just see you every morning when  I open my eyes Can I just feel your heart beating beside me Every night Can we just feel this way together Till the end of all time Can I just spend my life with you Can you run to these open arms  When no one else understands Can we tell God and the whole world You're my woman, and you're my man Can't you just feel how much I love you With one touch of my hand Can I just spend my life with you  Can I just spend my life with you Can I just spend my life with you (Forever here with you) Can I just spend my life with you Can I just see you every morning when I Open my eyes

       I'm going to blog about my boyfriend because I don't really seem to talk about him that much in my journal...  Kuan is something amazing.  I wouldn't know where to start or tell you when I started falling for him.  I'm just thinking about writing a note of congrats to him for being the new Midwest Governor 2004-2005....well, currently - the Midwest Governor Elect.  And how proud I am of him...how proud I am to be his girlfriend.  How happy that I am with him.  How...he can make my heart still beat a little bit faster..and how when he holds me, I feel so safe and comfortable...and how when he kisses me, my world spins a little bit...and how he'll lie there next to me and listen to me vent..and how he'll open up his heart and mind to me and share everything...how his family welcomes me in with open arms and how his mom always gives me the cutest gifts and is always thinking of me...how he knows me so well inside and out - he can tell how I am by the mere tone of my voice to my different looks..how comfortable we are with each other physically and emotionally...how we both sacrifice for each other...  And yes, I do get scared...but I know that we share so much together.  We talk about so much...we talk about our pasts have shaped us and how they don't bother us now because what we have is just ..amazing...  And we discuss our present - our fears, worries, dreams, aspirations....which leads us to share our future and our future hopes.  We talk about buying property together...building our dream home...to constantly talking about our future kids (He wants a boy first...but it's not just about a boy first - it's about getting the Lambda first) and what kind of parents we will be...how will we raise them?  punish them?  reward them?  love them.  *^_^*  We talk about our careers and where we want them to go...  How I need him...want him...desire him....and love him for everything that he is...and wants to be.

(just like a real woman has curves, right, Annie?) - and for the full picture, click on each one.                    Side note: don't go to Hawkeyes anymore for their wings...after 3pm on Mondays, their prices have been jacked up to 20 cents each which is a ripoff.  For way better and YUMMIER and three to four times their size, hit up Cans (on Damen - by North and Damen) for their Monday night 20 cent wings - Kuan was supposed to do an update on Cans wings but he got lazy..  But for the main reason for my post today..my prayers go out to my family friends in Joliet and Kankakee and the southwest suburbs of Chicago....  SPRING FURY  A swarm of tornadoes slams Illinois, leaving at least 4 dead Thunderstorms that pounded Chicago with rain Tuesday night also unleashed a series of tornadoes across northern Illinois, reportedly killing at least four people and cutting a path of devastation into Chicagoˆs southwestern suburbs. Fire crews from Chicago and Rockford sped toward Utica with equipment as rescue workers there clawed through the wreckage of a restaurant looking for people who might be trapped.  Officials believed several people had taken shelter in the basement of the collapsed building, and under generator-powered lights, emergency crews carefully pulled away debris. National Weather Service meteorologists said they were investigating reports that as many as 19 tornadoes touched down within a few miles of one another after 6 p.m., and at least 15,000 homes were without power across three counties Tuesday night  Apparently, people are describing this to the tornado that hit Plainfield back in 1990 when I was only 9 years old and I saw all this damage that happened...one of their neighbors - her house was completely gone and demolished.  Our house only lost a couple of shingles but we were okay...but three houses down, that house was gone...just ripped out of its roots...

            By  G. Bello        The small number of Asian American-based sororities is making a big impact. A far cry from the party girls and debutantes you might expect, the young women in these established groups dedicate themselves to sisterhood, focusing on Asian-American culture, serving the Asian American community, and confronting issues specific to Asians.     These Greek organizations exist all across the country. Although a concentration of groups bases themselves in California, they also appear at seemingly unlikely spots such as Texas where the South Asian studentry created Delta Kappa Delta (Texas A & M University, founded 1999), Delta Phi Omega (University of Houston, founded 1998), and Kappa Phi Gamma (University of Texas at Austin, founded 1998). More established Asian-American sororities include alpha Kappa Delta Phi, which has over 30 chapters coast to coast, and Sigma Omicron Pi, which was founded in 1930 by ten Asian American women at San Francisco State University (SFSU).        Oddly, the sorority alumna I spoke with first had no intention of joining a Greek organization at all. "I was dragged to a meeting by my friends," recounts Meda Higa, former president of alpha Kappa Delta Phi`s University of California at Santa Cruz chapter. "I didn`t anticipate joining, but it was an organization that I thought did more than party all the time. It was a chance to meet other Asian Americans and help out in the community."     Lecille Gomez, a founding sister of the SFSU chapter of the Filipino-based Kappa Psi Epsilon, also needed some prodding to join a Greek organization. "I never thought I would be the type of person who would join a sorority," she confesses, "but a bunch of my friends came up to me with the idea of forming aFilipino sorority. We had the common goal of learning about Filipino culture, and we could have our mission statement be what we wanted it to be."    For many prospective sisters, joining this type of sorority is a significant step towards understanding the issues that face Asian-American women. Meda grew up in a predominantly white town and says, "Up until college, it was a completely different scene. My [non-Asian] friends couldn`t relate to what I was experiencing at the time."    Similarly, Lecille relates how "My mom raised me with American culture. I didn`t even learn Tagalog. I joined [Kappa Psi Epsilon] because I felt I didn`t learn enough about [Filipino] culture." Lecille adds that the sisters would discuss cultural issues in their lives, such as the strictness of Filipino parents: "You couldn`t have a boyfriend &ndash; the majority of our parents were like that &ndash; and the sisters would talk about that."     These groups applied their interest in the community by raising awareness about causes on campus and beyond. Alpha Kappa Delta Phi`s UCSC chapter led an initiative to educate its community on domestic violence, as well as the need for Asian Americans to donate bone marrow. "We held a drive every year and advertised it," says Meda.    Kappa Psi Epsilon`s SFSU chapter focused on spending time with local Filipino war veterans, most of whom lack financial resources and all of whom to this day are denied veterans` benefits by the U.S. government. "We rented a tour bus and drove [the veterans from Sacramento] to San Francisco to see the Golden Gate Bridge because most of them had never seen that before. The Golden Gate is a symbol of freedom and America, so we thought they would want to see that," says Lecille.     Of course, sorority girls also know that social events are the foundation of sisterhood. At the University of Houston chapter of alpha Kappa Delta Phi, the Kappas occasionally ham it up with stage productions and festival performances. Last year, they teamed up with the fraternity Pi Kappa Alpha to produce a Broadway-style musical. According to Kimberly So, a college senior and National Board Southwest Governor, alpha Kappa Delta Phi was one of only two Asian sororities involved in the project.    In addition, the Kappas hold a festival called ASIA (Asian Students Initiating Awareness). Kimberly says, "We rented out the whole parking lot [of the Hong Kong City Mall], got different sponsors, raised $2,000 to fund the event, and people are donating tents." Performances by the sisters include the traditional dances of Vietnam, the Philippines, and China as well as modern dance and a fashion show.    Similarly, the University of Michigan chapter of alpha Kappa Delta Phi often joins other ethnic Greek organizations for social events. National Board Midwest Governor Shana Fu says, "We`ve done mixers with Greek organizations like [going out for] bubble tea, potlucks, bowling." They also come together to participate in events such as casino night and formal dances.     Participating in sororities brought these women closer to like-minded Asian Americans as well as the greater Asian American community and the older generation of immigrants. So forget what you`ve heard about brutal hazings and scandalous parties. Although the sisters definitely enjoy themselves, it`s helping out the community that brings a smile to these girls` faces.

       to go over last night's entry...for various reasons, I went out with one of my girls to hit up Hawkeyes for some wings and beer.  After a while of depressing talk, we were only allowed to talk about good things.  Is it that sad that it takes us so long to think of the good things in our life but we can just blurt out the negative things in our life....  If I were to sit down with you and we were only allowed to talk of the good things in our life going back and forth...do you think that you could hang?  Anyway - afterwards, I'm heading home and I get off and I'm waiting on the next bus stop and then, I realize...oh, crap - the Diversey bus doesn't run this late!!  :(  CRAP.  So I start walking towards Belmont and then, I see Wellington (I live on corner of Wellington and Sheridan) so I start walking down Wellington and then, I realize that I'm like 2 miles away from home.  Thank goodness for the people that I talked to on the phone.  I kept on replaying in my head to repeat my location in case I got jumped or something stupid like that.  But yeah...thank you lil sis Junko, lil bro Art, Aunt Bindu, and my pledge sis Donna.  I really appreciate it.  Anyway, in mid conversation with Donna, I see a cab and I'm jumping up and down and I had to chase the cab down the street..it slowed down but it was still coasting...the cab driver rolls down the window and is like "do you need a ride?"  I'm thinking"Sh*T of course I need a ride, why else would I be chasing your crappy car down the street"...anyway, so I lucked out and managed to cab the rest home.  *sigh*  Getting lost in Chicago kinda sucks...but it wasn't too bad because I was able to find my way after a while.

       reality check. when you've always been there for someone.  And even more recently, when you weren't up to it and feeling crappy and sick...and he/she asks you to be there for him/her and you sacrifice everything in a heartbeat to be there...  and then, when you need him/her to be there for you... and they never seem to be there. or anywhere to be found. and they stand you up...  when is enough enough?  and i don't want to get mad at this person because I know that they're busy but it just hurts knowing that this friendship is more one-sided.  How I want to be able to turn to this friend but I can't...because this friend is never around for me to turn and when I do turn to this friend, they just never have time for me...

       heehee... I love lying next to him while he snores away and occasionally opens an eye and tells me to sleep in.  I just can't sleep in.  I've been up since 7:45am...heehee...I think that his snoring has gotten worse, but maybe it's just me.  I should stick some acupuncture needles in him to make his snoring lessen...hehee..

       YAY!!  :)  Kuan and I just got a new cell phone plan.  I love my new phone - I now get freaking four bars of reception rather than before - I only had like one or two.  It's so pretty - Kuan convinced me to get the camera phone and now, we supposedly have the 'top of the line' phone...heehee...it's just so pretty and I'm excited that I can actually talk to people now.  *^_^*  YAY!!!  We even got the family plan...so I guess that means that we are taking our relationship to another level of commitment.  So, if you have T-mobile, call me anytime!!  Oh, yeah - the phone number remains the same, too.  If you don't have T-mobile...umm..Kuan can see how minutes I've talked - so please call me after 9pm or on the weekends!!

       CHEROKEE INDIAN WISDOM A Cherokee was teaching his grandson about life. He said "A fight is going on inside of me.  It is a fight between two wolves."  "One wolf is evil. He is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, guilt, arrogance, self-pity, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, ego and superiority." "The other wolf is good. He is joy, peace, love, compassion, humility, hope, serenity, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth and faith."  "This same fight is going on inside of you, and inside every other person."  The grandson thought for a minute and asked "Which wolf will win?"  The old Cherokee replied  "The one you feed."

       On a side note...last night was lovely.  It was the peace that I've been longing for.  After a crazy crazy week and half, I took the el (train) up to Wilmette (northern suburbs of Chicago) and Vince, Kuan's younger brother, who is my age, picked me up from the train station.  We chilled for a little bit and then, when his mom got home, I helped her with dinner.  After dinner, when his mom and I were doing the dishes - we chatted it up.  She showed me more of baby Kuan's pics..heehee.  It made me think of how adorable our babies are going to be.  Yeah, she hinted about Kuan and my kids, too.  Then, she started showing me Kuan's geeky jr high and high school pictures or as she put it "Kuan's skinny days"..heehee...  Then, Mr.Su, Mrs.Su, Vince, and I watched Mona Lisa Smile together...3/4th of the movie, Kuan came home..heehee..and accused me of trying to steal his family but I know that he doesn't mean it.  We had this talk.  I love how his family is so awesome and so welcoming to me.  And he loves how easily I fit in and how much they like me - he says that it allows him to spend quality time with both me and his family.  We also know that when we buy our house and our condo together, we can't be too far away.  And we also know that when we have our kids - we want them to be around his family as much as possible.  Sometimes, it makes me sad that my own family won't be as much in my kids and my family's life.  But i've accepted it - they live so far away and it's asking a lot.  I guess....I guess...*sigh*  But yeah - on a side note, last night was lovely.  Then, I came home to all this crap...blah.

       I am calm.  I don't care anymore.  It's amazing how the bullshit doesn't faze me anymore.  It's raining bad news and somehow, I'm still standing and I'm okay.  My friend told me how he got an ulcer from keeping everything in.  I won't let it out.  Then, I'm just being dramatic.  I won't go into how shady some people are and how I'm so fed up with everything.  And with that, I resign from xanga until another appropriate time.  I think that a handful of people know about this blogger - don't even know if they read it on a daily basis.  Doesn't matter.  I don't know what I want anymore.  I don't know what is right for me.  I don't know who I am and I don't know what is going on through my head.  All I know that is that half an hour ago, I was a complete bitch and just wanted to stay away from the world.....and avoided all contact...Why?  BECAUSE EVERYONE IS A FUCKING CRITIC....FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK...and then, suddenly I just broke down crying.  Because I'm weak.  And then, I just stopped.  I'm still hurting but I have nothing left in me to release.  Nothing.  With that, I have nothing left to write.

       To this particular ex...  How dare you.  How dare you call me and pretend that we are friends.  Acting as if I still care about you and your life.  And when I hang up on you, it's because I moved on and we were years ago.  How dare you call me to tell me that you're still in "love" with me.  To tell me that you've always cared but you felt like you weren't good enough for me.  FINE.  Let me put it bluntly then.  Is that supposed to make me feel sorry for you?  Am I supposed to be polite and be like "aww..poor baby - you were good enough for me."  Well, you know what...in the past two years, I may have learned a lot about the real world and reality and the corporate world.  But I learned just as much about "love".  I learned that the word is worth the wait.  I learned that the right one will love me for WHO I am and not who I could be.  Face it...you aren't good enough for me.  'Nuff said.  My realtionship witih Kuan isn't perfect but that's fine.  It's real.  It's real love and that's good enough for me.  I think that I'm being melodramatic and I'm just super emotional lately...kinda makes me want to curl up and hide from the world so they don't think that I'm some psychotic b*tch.  My last entry - it's not like my life is bad.  I'm fine.  I'm calm.  I'm not pissed.  I'm not angry.  I'm just dealing...and my life is "real".

       Sometimes, I feel fake.  I feel like I've aged so much.  I try to give people the benefit of the doubt but at the same time, nothing can completely faze me anymore.  They teach you in KDPhi that there is a thin line between business and personal.  Heck, the real world stresses it even more and that line grows thinner and thinner by the minute.  I know how shady people can be.  I know how people will do anything for money.  I know that loyalty is hard to come by.  I've learned how easy it is to promise someone something so they get off your back.  I've seen people crumble under pressure.  I've seen people give and give so much of themselves and get nothing in return.  I've seen people get walked all over.  I've heard people talk so much sh*t and how they're never content with what they have.  It's  almost like - what's the point of complaining.  But at the same time, silence says something.  When sometimes, you think that you can just shut up and suck it up.  Then, sometimes, they take your silence to mean something else.  I've learned about insurance and different insurance plans.  I've learned how the corporate world will suck you dry.  I've seen how they will do everything possible to cheat you and make you think that you just got a great deal.  I've heard people talk vengeance and revenge upon anyone who has wronged them.  I've seen people try to steal money from you and act as if you owed it to them.  I've felt the whiplash of someone's anger.  I've seen how quickly disappointment will grow into annoyance and then into anger.  I've seen how communication can deteriorate and ruin any working professional relationship, heck any relationship.  I've seen good but I've also seen plenty of bad.  I've learned about "mindset" and all the BS that it can be.  I've learned that it's best to be trained like a robot but at the same time, you need to have that HUMAN greed and that animalistic instinct.  Sometimes, you think that there is a hierarchy - heck, there is a wall of hierarchy (pyramid scheme) in the real world...and don't think that your small business is okay - eventually, you'll hit that point when it'll turn corporate and everything that you believed in once...will turn on you.  You may have your morals and high standards - don't ever give up on them.  Even if you do lose your job over it.  It sucks...we always preach quality over quantity (and YES, it is good in the long run to have quality QUALITY quality but...heck, it's the real world - quality doesn't matter - they just want the numbers cuz then, it's a mob mentality and we're all followers..)  And this is what I've learned from the two years since my graduation from college.  Enjoy college while you can live it up the bubble world...then, welcome to Reality.

       So...I'll do a bad/good post...I just want to vent and post up all this sh*tty and crappy stuff...but as I've learned in OM 1 - you  must have the yin with the yang.. So, here goes: B: There's so much pressure, lack of communication, and BS going on with work... G: But they're willing to pay 100% of my tuition for next semester  B: I forgot to change my billing address for this one medical loan of mine and apparently I haven't paid it since April 2003.  ARGH! G: I still have my eyes double lidded since January  B: My insurance is taking forever and a day to go through G: Good thing that I applied and got the Alliance Benefit plan which is better than nothing  B: I hate it when people just freaking take you for granted and assume that you have nothing better to do but to respond to their beck and call and they forget that you are VOLUNTEERING your time, energy, and effort. G: My lils are so freaking awesome.  I love being able to talk to Junko about the most random stuff!!  I had the most random conversation with her today but it was definately good.  Coco is such a sweetheart - always trying to check up on me.  Maggie puts a smile on my face, whether it's her being silly or being sarcastic - she always humors me, even when I'm in a foul mood - she'll listen to me vent away.   B: My mother is being a pain in the butt.  Enough said - if I was to get started on this, I'd never stop. G: My best friend, Robert, and I can still talk up a storm and he manages to put a smile on my face when before, there was the danger of tears..  B: I see myself slipping away from my two younger siblings, Cindy and Steve..as they grow up without me G: I love Kuan's family - how they welcome me into their family.  Mrs. Su invited me over for the weekend and I think that I'll prolly take her up on the offer - I miss hanging out with her  B: I'm kinda chunky G: I got my Bally's membership so I'll get to start working out ASAP  B: I keep on having all these nightmares and can't really sleep at night G: I'm getting a new cell phone service provider this week..probably Friday.  And that means that I'm taking the next step with Kuan..we're sharing a cell phone plan...OOOH  B: I hate seeing friends that I care about hurting.. G: but I love seeing the people that I care about happy.  on that note...I'm just going to leave it there and not think about anything else.

       Twin Christine and I both like the swan princess.  I know...the movie is super super cheesy and it's really lame.  But I like it.  And I was trying to figure out why.  I like that one song - "For longer than forever"...and I like it when you go from despising someone to suddenly liking them.  And when a guy can see past your exterior and truly fall in love with your whole being.  And I've been thinking a lot.  And even though sometimes, it scares me - I know how I truly feel for once.  I also know what I think about stuff.  I don't know what lies in my future.  I don't know if PCOM is my career for life.  I know that it's a strong possibility.  I know that there's a lot in it.  I know that I am a bright intelligent girl.  I know that I possess a lot of potential, but I also know that I want to go back to graduate school.  Not now but eventually.  I want to stop throwing away my money and I want to make some things more permanent.  I guess this week, I'll take one big step by changing my cell phone service provider.  One small commitment at a time.  And then, there's the relationship - this weekend, so many people asked me when the wedding will be.  And I know that Kuan and I definately see a future together.  I know that we're both on the same page.  And at the same time, we're having so much fun as is, why rush anything?   We didn't rush 'us' - why rush into anything anytime soon.  I know that we both wouldn't dare do anything stupid that would ruin 'us'.  So, the answer to the wedding question..."we're not rushing into that...but we'll keep you updated to when we're ready to"  And then...there's the whole other aspect of things.  Time to move along and when is a good time to say goodbye to something that you love and takes so much out of you.  Something that you sacrifice for and sometimes, you forget why..you forget the passion and you let petty stupid things get in the way of your love.  And sometimes, you think that perhaps, it is best to let go of that love.  Can I handle one more year?  Should I go for one more year and make it the best and last year ever...and then, step down to walk away...it'll always forever and a day be in my heart and always a part of my past that reshaped me...  Don't ever say that you'll love me forever.  I can't believe those words.  Just tell me that you love me now and that's more than enough.  Fickle our hearts are...and if your heart is true right now in the present - I can believe that and I can return that love.

       so odd...I thought that I was rid of him, but somehow he manages to resurface:  urlLink someone posted this in CL  and here - I'm just going to copy and paste... Dejvejprasit - sound familiar? Did anyone else get duped by this guy? He seems and acts like a really sweet guy. He's about 5'7" and is Thai, Taiwanese, and Chinese. He's a cocky but sweet and horny guy. He went to UCSB and is from Southern california. Lied to me about a couple things. Obviously cheated on me, as well. Claims to have knocked up this one girl and claims to have an ex-fiance. I don't believe him anymore about anything. But I do want closure. I want to know how many women he has been with from 2001-2003. I want to know the truth rather than his lies. The last name is far from common and he's a marine - so if you've heard of him or been duped by him - share with me  I know that one of his exes lives in Chicago so I'm trying to get ahold of you  *My response....I have my own life now.  I had my own closure.  The day that he said that he loved me but couldn't be with me.  The day that he said that he had two loves in his life.  Is it possible to be in love with two people at once?  Perhaps...but it's not a true love.  A true love is when you are able to join two WHOLE souls together and they can compliment each other.  I was young.  I was naive.  I was incredibly stupid.  And I was incredibly confused about my life - I hurt so many guys.  Last night, I admitted to Robert...if I could go back in my past.  The guys that I would take out would be Eddie Wong and Dwight Lin...because I hurt them.  I didn't mean to but I know that I hurt them - I deceived them and I was wrong.  I don't know if I'll respond to this craigslist posting...I guess that she's talking about me since I'm here in Chicago and pretty much - it's a known fact that I am here in Chicago but i have moved on...and I just want nothing to do with him.  But when I read that - I couldn't help but think - I hope that Karma works..and I hope that it hits him hard back.

       *Thanks Song* -How do like them apples?-  Women are like apples on trees.  The best ones are at the top of the tree. Most men don't want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of falling and getting hurt.  Instead, they just get the rotten apples from the ground that aren't as good, but easy... So the apples at the top think something is wrong with them, when in reality, they're amazing.  They just have to wait for the right man to come along, the one who's brave enough to climb all the way to the top  of the tree.  And... men are like a fine wine.  They start out as grapes, and it's up to women to stomp the crap out of them until they turn into something acceptable to have dinner with.

       I've been feeling like crap since last night.  More than ever.  Feeling lost and desolate....tossed and turned and had all these nightmares.  Couldn't sleep - lay awake tossing and turning nightmare after nightmare....finally called Robert for two hours and dreamed even more....then I woke up to the Reality and I hate what I just did to myself.

       So, on Monday, Kuan and I went into East Rogers Park to pick something up for me.  And this guy was helping me out and I saw where he lived.  Talk about minimalist.  It made me feel an immense sense of guilt.  He lived in a studio - possibly smaller than mine.  The entire place was carpeted but it was thin carpeting and looked kinda cheap.  There was two mattresses on the ground and there was a baby sleeping on one of them.  The bathroom looked pretty small and the kitchen looked to be the same size as mine.  But the living space was definately smaller.  And his wife was pregnant.  It made me sad that I take so much for granted.  Here I am wanting more and more and more...and I'm not a terribly materialistic person either.  And when Kuan and I were talking...he was saying how he wants a 2 bedroom condo or a 2 bedroom townhouse in the Evanston area when we get married.  And once we get our first kid, we'll have to start looking for a house with 4+ bedrooms.  And here - this guy is...with one kid, and another on the way...four people in one small studio.  I am spoiled, I guess.  Terribly lucky that my parents have always looked out for me and managed to provide.  Even with me...they lived in a studio with me but once my dad got his Ph.D. we bought a condo in Willowbrook - a little 2 bedroom apartment.  And then, my dad moved away to Taiwan...we lived in that condo for a while.  And then, my Dad came back with this hot new job and then, bam...we bought this five bedroom house.  Then, Cindy and Steve came along...and we filled up that house easily.  When I think of a dream house, I think of that house.  I really loved that house.  I had both bad and good memories but it was definately a dream house...at least for my family - it was perfect and it had everything that we could have ever asked for.  I want a home that I can call MINE..my own.  Well, I don't mind sharing it but I guess that it just comes to a point where you want to call some place that you live your home.  I hope for Kuan's sake...this job is the career that he wants to stay in.  And I hope that I'm playing my cards right and I'll remain in educational administration.  I hope...for a lot.  Perhaps too much.  Maybe I am being overly ambitious but what I do know is that...Kuan and I dream a lot together when right now, all we have is love.  And maybe that is enough but I know on a sad materialistic note, it's not enough for the two of us.

       Sometimes..the Asian gossipiness comes out...and YES, today, I have HELLA gossip.  *wink* Today - the FBI called me and a former employee of my old company...apparently - my old company is under review for customer fraud.  And I found out about some people leaving there.  GOOD.  I hope that they go under.  That place was nothing but a headache and heartache for me.

And now...back to work.

       I just got my paycheck and was complaining about how much they take out of each paycheck..and did some calculations...I realized the the freaking government takes out $8,000 out of my salary every year in taxes and deductions...the real world sucks..  and a post from my xanga about the corporate real world... Sometimes, I feel fake.  I feel like I've aged so much.  I try to give people the benefit of the doubt but at the same time, nothing can completely faze me anymore.  They teach you in KDPhi that there is a thin line between business and personal.  Heck, the real world stresses it even more and that line grows thinner and thinner by the minute.  I know how shady people can be.  I know how people will do anything for money.  I know that loyalty is hard to come by.  I've learned how easy it is to promise someone something so they get off your back.  I've seen people crumble under pressure.  I've seen people give and give so much of themselves and get nothing in return.  I've seen people get walked all over.  I've heard people talk so much sh*t and how they're never content with what they have.  It's  almost like - what's the point of complaining.  But at the same time, silence says something.  When sometimes, you think that you can just shut up and suck it up.  Then, sometimes, they take your silence to mean something else.  I've learned about insurance and different insurance plans.  I've learned what different benefits different companies offer.  I've learned that they will always make their company sound like they're giving you a great deal (btw - HMOs and PPOs are a rip-off) and I've learned about 401Ks and I've learned about reviews and promotions and commissions and I've learned that little things DO add up.  I've learned how the corporate world will suck you dry.  I've seen how they will do everything possible to cheat you and make you think that you just got a great deal.  I've heard people talk vengeance and revenge upon anyone who has wronged them.  I've seen people try to steal money from you and act as if you owed it to them.  I've felt the whiplash of someone's anger.  I've seen how quickly disappointment will grow into annoyance and then into anger.  I've seen how communication can deteriorate and ruin any working professional relationship, heck any relationship.  I've seen good but I've also seen plenty of bad.  I've learned about "mindset" and all the BS that it can be.  I've learned that it's best to be trained like a robot but at the same time, you need to have that HUMAN greed and that animalistic instinct.  Sometimes, you think that there is a hierarchy - heck, there is a wall of hierarchy (pyramid scheme) in the real world...and don't think that your small business is okay - eventually, you'll hit that point when it'll turn corporate and everything that you believed in once...will turn on you.  You may have your morals and high standards - don't ever give up on them.  Even if you do lose your job over it.  It sucks...we always preach quality over quantity (and YES, it is good in the long run to have quality QUALITY quality but...heck, it's the real world - quality doesn't matter - they just want the numbers cuz then, it's a mob mentality and we're all followers..)  And this is what I've learned from the two years since my graduation from college.  Enjoy college while you can live it up the bubble world...then, welcome to Reality.

       ALCOHOROSCOPES   What are you?   ARIES  Drinking style  Impulsive Aries people like to party and sometimes don't know when to call it a night. Their competitive streak makes them prone to closing-time shot contests. They're sloppy, fun drunks, and they get mighty flirty after a couple tipples. Getting Aries people drunk is a good way to get what you want out of them, should other methods fail. Aries can become bellicose when blotto, but they will assume that whatever happened should be forgiven (if not forgotten) by sunrise. They can be counted on to do the same for you -- so long as you haven't gone and done anything really horrible to them last night, you sneaky Gemini.      TAURUS  Drinking style  Taurus prefers to drink at a leisurely pace, aiming for a mellow glow rather than a full-on zonk. Since a truly intoxicated Taurus is a one-person stampede, the kind of bull-in-a-china-shop inebriate who spills red wine on white carpets and tells fart jokes to employers, the preference for wining and dining (or Bud and buddies) to body shots and barfing is quite fortunate for the rest of us. This is not to say that the Bull is by any means a teetotaler -- god, no. A squiffy Taurus will get, er, gregarious (full of loudmouth soup, some would say) and is extremely amusing to drag to a karaoke bar when intoxicated.   GEMINI  Drinking style  Geminis can drink without changing their behavior much -- they're so naturally chatty and short-attention-spanned that it's just hard to tell sometimes. They can amaze you by conversing with finesse and allusion, then doing something to belie an extremely advanced state of intoxication, like puking in your shoe. Geminis possess the magic ability to flirt successfully (and uninfuriatingly, which is very tricky) with several people at once. They like to order different cocktails every round -- repetition is boring -- and may create a theme (like yellow drinks: beer, sauvignon blanc and limoncello) for their own amusement.   CANCER  Drinking style  Cancer is a comfort drinker -- and an extra wine with dinner or an after-work beer or six can be extra comforting, can't it, Cancer darling? Like fellow water signs Scorpio and Pisces, Crabs must guard against lushery. Cancers are brilliant at ferreting out secret parties and insinuating themselves on VIP lists -- and, in true Hollywood style, Cancers are never really drunk; instead, they get "tired and emotional" (read: weepy when lubricated). But there's nothing better than swapping stories (and spit) over a few bottles of inky red wine with your favorite Cancer. Even your second-favorite Cancer will do. The sign also rules the flavor vanilla, and you'd be adored if you served up a vanilla vodka and soda.   LEO  Drinking style  Leo likes to drink and dance -- they're often fabulous dancers, and usually pretty good drinkers as well, losing their commanding dignity and turning kittenish. Of course, they're quite aware they're darling - Leos will be Leos, after all. They generally know their limit, probably because they loathe losing self-control. When they get over-refreshed, expect flirting to ensue -- and perhaps not with the one what brung them. But Leo's not the type to break rules even when drunk, so just try to ignore it (try harder, Cancer) and expect a sheepish (and hung over) Lion to make it up to you the next day.   VIRGO  Drinking style  Cerebral Virgos are compelled to impose order onto their bender. Their famously fussy quest for purity could lead to drinking less than other signs, sure -- but it could also lead to drinking booze neat, to sucking down organic wine or just to brand loyalty. They rarely get fully shellacked -- but, oh, when they do! Virgo's controlled by the intellect, but there's an unbridled beast lurking within, and they let it loose when walloped. It's dead sexy (and surprisingly unsloppy). As one Virgo friend used to declare, "I'm going to drink myself into a low level of intelligence tonight." A toast to the subgenius IQ!   LIBRA  Drinking style  "I'm jusht a social drinker," slurs Libra, "it's jusht that I'm so damn social?" Libra loves nothing more than to party, mingle and relate to everyone. Whether dipped in favor of Good Libra (with Insta-Friend device set to "on") or heavier on the Evil Libra side (they are little instigators when bored), the Scales can really work a room. Charming as they are, Libras are notoriously lacking in self-control, however, which can get them into all sorts of trouble -- including wearing their wobbly boots waaaay too early in the evening, flirting with their best friend's beau or even blacking out the night's events entirely. Oops!   SCORPIO  Drinking style  Don't ever tell Scorpios they've had enough, for they'll smirk at you and quietly but intentionally keep tippling till they're hog-whimpering drunk, out of 100-proof spite. Scorpios like to drink, and screw you if you have a problem with that. Most of them see the sauce as something to savor in itself, and not as a personality-altering tool -- though if depressed, self-loathing Scorps seek total obliteration. But generally, they're fascinating drinking pals, brilliant conversationalists and dizzying flirts. They also remember everything -- especially what you did when you were blitzed. Only drink with a Scorpio who likes you.   SAGITTARIUS  Drinking style  In vino veritas -- and, for Sagittarius, in booze blurtiness: When buttered, they'll spill all your secrets and many of their own. Tactlessness aside, Sagittarius is just plain fun to drink with. This is a sign of serious partying (what else would you expect from the sign of Sinatra, Keith Richards, the Bush twins and Anna Nicole Smith?). They're the people who chat up everyone in the room, then persuade the entire crowd to travel somewhere else -- like a nightclub, or a playground, or Cancun. Good-natured hijinks are sure to ensue (including a high possibility of loopy groping; spontaneous Sag is a brilliant booty call).   CAPRICORN  Drinking style Capricorn is usually described as practical, steadfast, money-hungry and status-thirsty -- no wonder they get left off the astrological cocktail-party list. But this is the sign of David Bowie and Annie Lennox, not to mention Elvis. Capricorn is the true rock star: independent, powerful and seriously charismatic, not too eager to please. And if they make money being themselves, who are you to quibble? But just like most rock stars, they're either totally on or totally off, and they generally need a little social lubricant to loosen up and enjoy the after party, especially if they can hook up with a cute groupie.   AQUARIUS  Drinking style  Aquarius and drinking don't go together that well (except for water, that is). They have an innate tendency toward know-it-allism, and if they get an idea while sizzled, they're more stubborn than a stain or a stone. If they're throwing a party or organizing an outing, however, they're too preoccupied with their duties to get combative -- and they make perfectly charming drunks in that case. Fortunately, they're usually capital drink-nursers. They also make the best designated drivers (if you can get them before they start raising their wrist): Aquarius is fascinated by drunk people and capable of holding interesting conversations with soused strangers while sober.   PISCES  Drinking style  If you're a Pisces, you've probably already heard that you share a sign and an addictive personality -- with Liz Taylor, Liza Minelli and Kurt Cobain. Not only do Pisces like to lose themselves in the dreamy, out-there feeling that only hooch can give, but they build up a mighty tolerance fast. Who needs an expensive date like that? On the other hand, they're fabulously enchanting partners, whether in conversation or in crime. With the right Pisces, you can start out sharing a pitcher of margaritas and wind up in bed together for days. The phrase "addictive personality" can be read two ways, you know

       Next year will be 2005 and it will mark my three year anniversary from graduating college, and next year, I will apply for graduate school part-time programs because I know that I cannot afford to go to school full-time.  Currently, I will be applying to two schools - Northwestern's MBA part-time program ranked #1 and Depaul's MBA part-time program ranked #8.  And yes, if all goes well, I will be starting school in Fall 2006.  :)  Why the deadline?  Because when I graduated from undergraduate and decided that I wanted to get my MBA, all these schools told me that I needed a minimum of three years working experience.  And all the schools that didn't need that minimum - well, they're not worth mentioning.  Time to get some things into focus.

       Love is about commitment on both sides to making things work when things are no longer new and easy. Love is about sharing similar goals and dreams, and it'sa bout wanting the person you adore to be happy, even if what makes him happy isn't necessarily something that will make you happy.  But love is something you can't truly feel for another person until you feel it for yourself - for in the romantic equation, it's not two halves that make a whole, but two that gloriously come together.  Thanks Biggie Leng..

       I'm up...getting ready for my morning run... and I can't help but think and quote from someone's xanga.. "but it's a lot of changes happening soon so we'll see how things pan out for me this time" and I want nothing but his happiness but the changes aren't just changes in his career.  The changes are happening to his character, as well.  If I just take a step back - I can see how he himself is changing....

       *first glass of wine* *tear*....I feel "sad" and "lost" but those words still don't fully encompass how I truly feel...thank goodness for best friends.  The same best friend that I called when I locked myself in Duy's bathroom.  The same best friend who came to my rescue...the same best friend who drove all the way up to Santa Barbara from San Diego to be there for me.  The same one who carried me out when I fainted and when I wiped mascara and lipstick all over his white line jacket.  The same one who is there for me time and time over again.  *first bottle of wine* Finished that in mid-sobbing with the best friend.  Moved on from white wine to the red wine.  Needed/Wanted something stronger...and stopped crying...he says that I stopped crying because I was drinking so much and thus, I was dehydrated.  Stopped talking to him...and realized how pathetic I must be because I was drinking alone.  And somehow, I continued drinking  *umpteenth glass of wine* I really should get wine glasses when I have the money.   When I have the money...I'm a sad sad soul.  When I have money, I splurge on other people.  The closest thing that you will get from me buying something for myself is for my apartment.  I need to learn to start saving my money.  I can be so stupid sometimes...I have the urge to cry...  *first glass of water* I want to cry but I can't..maybe I really am dehydrated so I start drinking some water.  and decide to go online.  I find myself another lonely person sipping on wine - Li - so we become online wine buddies...  *another umpteenth glass of wine* As we're chatting and I'm busy talking to other ppl, I'm drinking...sipping away....and soon the glass of wine is gone...must refill...  *second bottle of wine* somehow disappeared.  The Chianti was strong...bitter..not something that I was used to to but ironically enough, it's all gone.  "Tse cu" - in chinese, it means to eat bitterness.  Well, I drank the bitterness..and it makes me think that life is never going to be sugar coated and all pretty for me.  Life is full of bitterness and suffering.  At work, I'm dealing with pressure and all these "quotas" to be met.  Wo zai tse cu and I'd like to think that I'm strong enough to handle it without running.  I don't know anymore.  I'm a runner at heart...and I run from fear.  There have been a few times where I haven't run away and sometimes...I don't know if it's worth it to stay..or is it more worth it to run away?  *first glass of wine from the third bottle* I'm sipping and this is a light fruity white wine....and my tears are flowing. I don't know where it's coming from.  I do understand.  And maybe that is why I'm crying.  Because I do understand and I know that I'm unreasonable.  And it's all my fault.  I do understand the politics of it all and I do understand the technicalities and I do understand what I must do but it's so hard to execute what I must do.  How much longer must I tse cu?  *halfway through the third bottle* I think that I'm going to sign offline and finish my bottle.... I need to stop being overly emotional and I need to stop crying. I just need my space to recover.  *done drinking* I finished my third bottle... tired..burnt out..exhausted confused...lost...warm.. and I still have some tears in my eyes and i still feel just as lost as when I started. Do I stay and eat more bitterness? Or do I run away and never face my fears? perhaps..it's "unrealistic" or maybe it's "hopeful" for a world that doesn't really exist.

       So today was an interesting day...I woke up to my boyfriend planting huge kisses all over my face and then, seeing him leave.  I dragged my poor body up and forced it to go running - MUST tone my body...and then, from 8:45 - 12:30 I had my Tai Ji Chuan class...and man, after that - my knees were achey.  I headed to the gym and had a pilates class....and then, i came home to realize that my darn laundry room doesn't have a coin machine so I needed to go get money.  I decide to return my videos back to Blockbuster and hit up the Jewel nearby to grab some money...  And then, as soon as I get home - Srey comes over...we end up chatting as girls do and then, Leng calls - we go eat dinner at Joy Yees and the boyfriend joins us...  Anyway - now to the real point of this blog.  Cherry Red - that's the club that we went to tonight.  I went because I haven't been out with the girls in sooo long and Srey was in town from Philly so I headed out - butt tired and exhausted.  But I had soo much fun.  I enjoyed dancing with the girls - catching up with different girls...there were soo many alum there...from UIUC Duyen, Jenny, and Amy to UIC Joy, Bea, Elaine, Char, Stephanie, Ats, Mina, Hana, Linda (beta class), Christina (gamma class), Leng, Aileen, Carmen, Srey, Samera, Linda (eta class) - it was definately nice to feel comfortable.  Not feeling old or having to babysit.  I felt somewhat at place.  The only thing that kept on happening throughout the night.. WHERE IS KUAN? ARE YOU OKAY?  DID YOU AND KUAN BREAK UP?  IS THAT WHY HE ISN'T HERE? OH, HEY - IS KUAN HERE? and *sigh*  I know that the two of us have dating for a while but it kinda sucks that the first thing that you're going to say to me is about him.  And just becuase he's not by my side doesn't mean that we're going through issues.  He's just tired and he's had a long day at work...that's it...*sigh*

       I'm halfway there to my vacation.  And it'll fly by before I know it... The silent dangerous calm is still around and all hell will eventually break loose. You know...the silent dangerous calm that a suicidal person goes through when they finally make up their mind how they're going to off themselves...when...when they've finally accepted their fate.  *silence*

       The L word is a funny word.  Not even funny though.  It's just an "interesting" word.  Do you say it because you mean it?  Or do you say it because someone said it to you first and you're just returning it?  Do you say it because you hope to get something out of it?  Do you say it because you truly do love that person?  I can't be the person you want me to be.  I can't say the words you want me to say.  I can't think the way you want me to think.  And I'm tired.  Tired of everything.  Somehow, I look forward to my vacation and a part of me isn't looking forward to it.  Breathe.  Just take a huge breath of air and let it seep through your lungs.  Sometimes, when you're so busy, you forget to really breathe...or when you're concentrating so hard on everything, you forget to breathe...humans are so fickle.  Women are so fickle.  And men?  Men just don't know.  Sometimes...it's a part of life.  Some friendships just weren't meant to be...and sometimes, the best way to love someone is to let them go.

       *sigh*  I hate how money rules the world and how sometimes, I'll be willing to do this random stuff for money.  For example, those stupid psych tests.  And now, I'm about to go on another quest for money.  Yeah, it does run my life.  It allows for my luxury and it allows for my sorrow.  I'm just a frustrated little girl right now.  I know that I shouldn't be a hypocrite but at the same time, the situation is very much different.  I don't want to go into details but I just need to vent...I think that I'll go for another run.

       Since Kuan's started his new job, he's had to work some crazy hours...he works Monday - Friday from 7:30am to 7pm...and on Thursdays, he doesn't get off until 8:30 or 9pm...and on Saturdays, he works from 8:30am - 5:30pm.  And I do support him with this crazy new schedule - it's a bit rough and we really don't get a chance to see each other and when we do, the time is really short and we're both really tired....  But this weekend was different.  I know that I had a hundred and one things to catch up on but after class on Saturday, Kuan picked me up and came over...we watched "So Close' together since I enjoyed it so much...we went to Margie's Candies and had some of their amazing dessert...I had the raspberry sundae (scoops of French Vanilla ice cream drizzled with raspberries and sauce...and homemade fudge with whipped cream and nuts..*YUM*) and Kuan had their Turtle Sundae (ice cream with homemade fudge and caramel drizzled together)  We hit up the Comic Bookshop on North and I also got a pair of shoes (this was the weekend for shoe shopping) that are great for formals!  Then, we tramped up and down Clark St. to hit up the other comic book shop and do some more shoe shopping.  Alas - all was to no avail...so we hit up Borders instead and found ourselves lost in books for the next two hours.  Then, we hit up the grocery store and ordered some pizza from pizza hut and also rented two movies from Hollywood Video (which btw, apparently honors other video stores coupons!  So I got this discounted deal which was pretty awesome all because I pulled out the wrong coupon and card!  Silly me)...and the rest of the Saturday night was just...pizza, movie, wine, and of course my awesome boyfriend.  Today was waking up and being goofy and talking and booking a car rental for next week's vacation.  Can you believe it...in less than five days, I'll be on a plane to California.  I've never had a guy go to this extreme before for me.  It'll be our second trip out to California but it'll be our first time just being US...no kdphi or lambda obligations for a couple days...no family or friends obligations...well, of course - we still do but we are setting aside four days for just US.  Anyway...back to our day...we stopped by Bobtail's Fountain (the new ice cream place on the corner of my street) and went down Clark again..I found a cute pair of heels that would go great with my suit and Kuan and I had a blast in this comic book shop *yay*  Then, we headed off to Michael's where we picked up all of these arts and crafts stuff for our little artsy crafty date.  *^_^*  On our way out, we hit up one more shoe store and I couldn't resist - there were these cute sandals on sale and on top of that, Kuan even got new dress shoes for himself - like I said - this weekend was all about buying shoes!!  *tongue*  And then, we dropped by Old Orchard - got to see my biggie Leng and give her gifts for her babies since I'll be missing Installs...saw Frances and Samera...even got to see Allison around Old Orchard, too.  Afterwards - Kuan and I just spent the rest of our afternoon being artsy crafty  *^_^*  And the end result is great...I  can't wait to give these gifts away!!  And then, Scrabble with Kuan and Vince....dinner with the Su family and then, we all watched "Going to America" afterwards...which really made me reflect on a lot of things....and then, Kuan took me home.  It was the long-awaited quality time with Kuan that I needed.  *GRIN*  And it did me a lot of good - I've got a crazy busy week ahead but it's okay because after a long LONG day on Thursday, I have my vacation to look forward to...time with my girls...my family..my friends..and of course, my runaway with Kuan *wink*  Breathe, Donna - this week will fly by before you know it.

       The Seven Wonders of the World.   A group of students were asked to list what they thought were the present  "Seven Wonders of the World." Though there were some disagreements, the following received the most votes:  1. Egypt's Great Pyramids  2. Taj Mahal   3. Grand Canyon  4. Panama Canal   5. Empire State Building    6. St. Peter's Basilica    7. China's Great Wall    While gathering the votes, the teacher noted that one student had not finished her paper yet. So she  asked the girl if she was having trouble with her list. The girl replied, "Yes, a little.  I couldn't quite make up my mind because  there were so many." The teacher said, "Well, tell us what you have, and maybe we can help." The girl hesitated, then read, "I think the 'Seven  Wonders of the World' are:    1. to see   2. to hear  3. to touch   4. to taste  5. to feel   6. to laugh   7. and to love."    The room was so quiet you could have heard a pin drop. The things we overlook as simple and ordinary and that we take for granted are truly wondrous! A gentle reminder -- that the most precious things in life cannot be built by hand or bought by men.

I know that I'm across the country but I am here..if you'll only let me help.

In the process of courtship, the approach that would make you feel irresistable is patience, never give up on you. 3.  The impression you would like to give to your lover is optimistic. 4.  You don't like it when your partner is emotional and/or too moody; and you don't know how to please him/her. 5.  The kind of relationship you would like to build with your partner is that both of you can talk about everything and  anything, no secret is kept. 6.  You care about the society and morality, you won't do anything    wrong after marriage. 7.  You think of marriage as a precious thing.  Once you get married, you'll treasure it and your partner very much. 8.  At this moment, you think of love as a committment for both parties.  Your first name of Donna has made you happiest when you are expressing in some creative, artistic way, and not conforming to strict routine. In a large group of comparative strangers, you are quiet and rather shy, unable to express yourself, not really wanting to become involved in conversation. On the other hand, among friends with whom you feel at ease, you are expressive, witty, and quite charming. These contrasting natures make it difficult for people to understand you and can lead to friction in your personal life. You are deep, philosophical, and refined, but your extremely sensitive nature causes you to become depressed and self-pitying over any real or imagined slight  Your first name of Kuan has given you a pleasant, easy-going, friendly nature. Personal contacts are important to you. In situations where you are serving others, demonstrating or instructing, you have the patience to go into details that someone else may not think to be important. In your association with others, you are often limited to the more mundane happenings and little personal problems that can be so frustrating to those of an active, dynamic nature.

Seeing my family..mom..pops...(ya know, the parental units)...taking the two youngest sibs out to Shrek 2...meeting and seeing Kuan's relatives out here...  and best of all, spending some quality vacation time with my boyfriend.&nbsp; *^_^*

       Well, last night was really sweet of Kuan and I got to wake up this morning to his breathing and it reminded me of that one Faith Hill song "Breathe"...and I just wanted to smother him with kisses.  Instead, I made him breakfast.  :-P  Being the sweetie that he is, he took me to work and dropped me off.  This week is a good week.  We brought in ten applicants - the most that we have ever done.  Pretty awesome.  *^_^*  I'm definately excited.  Work is starting to pick up - it's been crazy stressful, pressuring, and busy but I tell myself that it'll all be worth it in the end.  I got my RCN refund because they "accidently" charged my debit card $125 and I had to go yell at them - I currently have a $19.99 montly promotional.  grrrr...hate RCN with a passioN!  And best of all....I checked my T-mobile minutes and I think that this is perfect for Kuan and me - we're not going over our minutes at all!!  :-)  We're currently halfway through our minutes...and we've got 214 whenever (out of 800), 277 weekend/nights (out of unlimited) and 429 mobile-to-mobile (out of unlimited) which is mostly just him and me talking.  We're talking about lowering our plan's minutes, too since apparently, we're not using the phone as much.  some eeehhhhh... news: my acupuncturist caught me flexing my wrist cuz it was a bit sore and he said that I'm starting to develop carpal tunnel - damn jobs that leave me in front of a laptop all day long!  :-P   But he did some acupressure and massage on me which left me kinda sore but good sore - at least my wrist doesn't hurt as much anymore.  I think that I'm going to cancel plans today iwth my childhood friends - I really need to clean up my apartment (funny how anal I am about being clean once I live by myself - I have to sweep and mop my hardwood floors at least once a week and scrub my bathroom once a week, too and I usually do my dishes right away) and I still haven't unpacked yet!!  That's how crazy busy I've been.  I made the right choice....I dropped two of my four classes - work is just super demanding and on top of that, I'm worried about my family - I think that I'll be heading back either in June or July to just spend time with my family, especially my mom.  I worry a lot about her.  Yeah - I dropped my Friday night class and my Saturday morning one.  It now opens up my weekends again....  And Kuan quit his job on Tuesday....I don't know what to say.  I guess that I am a bit surprised but at the same time, I just want him to be happy and yes, a part of me is happy that my boyfriend isn't working 12 hour days six days a week.  Whatever it takes for us to be happy, I know that I'll do.

       So, for my three year anniversary, my bf wanted to do something special for me...and he did.  He took me out to dinner at Bamee's (I like their Thai) and then we rented some videos.  *^_^*   Simple but sweet...and thoughtful.

       Two more hours before I get to leave.  Two more hours.  I have so much work to do but for some reason, I feel so blase about everything.  I need to get out of this funk.  I feel kinda gross right now.  I didn't wake up early enough to go work out so now, I feel bleah.  I quit xanga.  Why?  I dunno - I just got tired of it.  Xanga seemed like such the social thing to do and right now, I guess - I'm not exactly in a social mood.  The IT guy is out of town for the week and I guess that technically I could be online but I don't feel like it plus i have work to get done.  I'm sleepy, too.  Bleah.  What a day.  I feel so tempted to just leave early but I know that I won't.  I'll be good.  Three years since I crossed - wow, so much has happened in just three years.  *sigh*

       I've been numb....and just out of it...indifferent...blase about many things in life..insecure about me..hurt and disappointed...and more or less..very much overwhelmed.  And there is no explanation or at least, none that I care to share with the world.  There is many overwhelming factors going on with me.  And I've become numb to reaction.  I couldn't cry until tonight...finally, I cried to my best friend...  but i don't care anymore...i don't care to explain my actions and why i acted so aloof and distant from everyone.  someone asked me about the cons of this weekend.  the biggest con was...there were so many people that i wanted to see- my lil bro art...lil sis coco and grand lil jia...lil sis junko...lil sis maggie...grand lil venus...lil bro andy....and i had obligations to the national alumnae board.  i'm not complaining - i knew that deep down inside that i had these obligations and they came as priority...it's just hard that i didn't get to spend time with them.  and that's my fault.  i am tired...so tired...one of those weary feelings...where i wish that icould lie down and never wake back up.

       After craving to see this movie for the last two months and somehow, every time I go to the videoshop, it's been rented out.  And I think that it came out in 1999.  Anyway...after watching it and reflecting upon my day...these past couple weeks....  I think that this is it for me.  I think about all that I've learned and seen and experienced and felt lately.  And how all of it has a meaning behind it.  And how it's okay that I go through some struggles and ups and downs.  It's okay because I've realized that I took this risk and I took this chance and I'm making it happen for me.  And people are going to come and go...and that's fine.  And things aren't going to go my way..and that's fine.  Things sometimes have to go down before they can go back up.  It just hurts when they go down.  I've made a couple commitments next year...and I will stick to them.  If she makes it, I'll be there that night, and then, no more....I will fulfill my responsibilities and obligations, and then, it'll be the last....I will give my all one last year and then, time for retirement.  I told myself that career-wise, nothing is perfect and nothing will be perfect just as long as my attitude and I keep my chin up and keep on trucking, it'll be okay.  I'll finish off this year just as I started it - on top of the game.  I'm not going to give up because of someone else.  And lastly...is it possible for a girl to have two best friends?  Somehow, I now do....  I plan to keep the old and grow even more with the new.  And maybe things now don't seem so cheery but they happen for a reason.  *sigh*  No more wine...a lot of no's for me for the rest of the summer.. No more beer *sniff - I am sad but no more* No more fast food - I may make an exception once a month and so far June has not been satisfied No more xanga No more drinking alone...I know that it numbs the hurt and the pain but no more....just think of "When a Man Loves a Woman" No more AIM at work..yeah, I hate it but rules are rules and I must stop trying to break the rules - if you really want to talk to me at work - email me. No more ice-cream - just shaved ice and maybe sorbet No more cheese and nachos No more being lazy and taking the bus to work this summer...you're walking that mile every morning and that mile every night No more random spree shopping - you're going to save up that money and buy the PDA that you want for your birthday and then, you'll save up again to buy that computer that you wanted for Christmas.... No more crazy spending money on Greek apparel for family - you've given enough.. No more eying stuff for sale on Craigslist - you'll deal and figure stuff out.  You don't need an entertainment set right now.  You're perfectly fine as is. There's a couple more but I need to go hit up the gym again..

       I hate saying goodbyes...I hate thinking about how I'm going to miss that person...I hate feeling that sad feeling.  Back when I was younger and my dad would have to go back to Taiwan...I was a bad daughter - I didn't go to the airport to send him off.  I didn't want to say goodbye.  I refused to cry.  Grace cried..at least she was honest with herself.  I denied myself that.  And for that, I blame myself.  Tonight, it was pouring in Chicago as if the heavens itself were bawling...rain was shooting everywhere...I walked home tonight from work at 9pm...my pants from the thigh down were soaked..my shoes were water logged...my socks drenched...and more water on my face from my tears.  I wanted to go running tonight but I didn't.  Goodbyes hurt.  And maybe it's from all that bottled up emotion...

       and to make things worse... i weighed myself today.  it's officially - since moving to chicago, i've gained 20lbs...summer goal: lose 15lbs and cut 5 inches off of my waist and i'm officially doing the bally's boot camp thing *sniff*

       Things are getting worse...how is that possible?  I don't freaking know....day by day, it's harder and harder to keep one foot in front of the other and my chin up high.  Sometimes, I feel like I have to because I'm one of those tightrope walkers...and one look down could cause me to fall and stumble to my doom.  I bought my tickets...I'm coming in a week and I'll see what I can fix or what I can do to ease your burden....but I am human.  I am 22 years old...there is only so much burden that I can shoulder...and obligation..yes.  Responsibility...yes.  *sigh*

       Wednesday.. I'm stressed... overqualified for something...frustrated over results... panicked and having anxiety attacks about trying to provide independently On the up side...Kuan is here.. He picked me up yesterday and took me to a Rib place (it was okay - Joe's Ribs off of North and on Weed Street is much better and a better deal for your money, too) Then, we watched Harry Potter and in the movie theatre's arcade, we played some games.... thank god for Kuan....

       After deep discussion with a good friend...we were talking about regrets and talks about the future.  He asked me what I want in my future....what will I regret not doing?  What will I regret doing?  What do I see career-wise?  I see...a desire to stay in Education.  That's the one tie that I have had with all of my jobs - I like working with colleges, I see...from working for UCSB to Princeton Review to getting people into college to more UCSB to NCSA where high school athletes dreamed of playing collegiate sports to Pacific College...why Education?  I'm not quite sure but there's something about staying in Education.  Why I refuse to go corporate.  Why I didn't go for Boeing or Rapid Displays....  But the one thing that I will regret not doing...allowing myself to fully overcome my fears...my insecurities and really truly fall in love...more than my career, I want a family.  Not now...not anytime soon but someday, sometime.  I want kids....I want a chance.  I want that.  The one thing that I value more than anything else is stability.  I want stability career-wise...financially...emotionally...  I know that is close to impossible.  What I want isn't going to happen..not anytime soon, at least.  The one thing that I do regret doing...letting others walk over me.  Because I refuse to sink down to their level, I let them get away with ....stuff...  Some relationships aren't meant to be...some friendships aren't meant to be.  When you only hear negativity from them, you get tired of it.  I know that friends are supposed to be there for you through the ups AND the downs...what happens when you're down and those people only push you further down.  I know that my friends are honest with me...but when I only hear from you to push me down even more and to put my faults to my face...*sigh*  I make mistakes...I'm human and when I know that I messed up, I do try to fix them..BUT do you see me shoving your mistakes in your face time and time over again?  *sigh*  Time to stop regretting and time to start letting go....  Another thing that I regret...settling for something.  It's one thing to suffer and take on sacrifice but it's another thing to settle for less because I didn't want to really work super hard.  Settling...for a mediocre raise because I couldn't find it in me to speak up...settling for a mediocre place...but at the same time, I understand that sometimes, you make a sacrifice or in chinese "tse cu"...or even settling for a guy because I thought that it was time to settle down.  Silly me - you can't tell your heart when to settle down..it'll happen when it happens...  The one thing that I don't regret...taking a risk..trusting certain people..opening up my heart to certain people..loving certain people...putting my whole heart and soul and 110% of me into something...at least, now I know...I am capable of putting that much into something.  So, I guess that these are my priorities in my life....and my dreams....of Family, Education, and Stability...

       I have that pit feeling of disgust and as much as everyone tells me to stablize...my heart isn't in this anymore and I feel frustrated.  Frustrated that I keep on trying but instead, I feel disheartened.  Yesterday, Kuan told me that I had a really negative viewpoint...and it wasn't just negative..it was just really realistic and I'm so frustrated and ...sad.  Sad that this obviously isn't going to work out.

       I'm so disappointed...feel like just giving up faith and hope.  It's sad how the same person seems to disappoint me time and time over again.  It's one thing to have high expectations - it's another thing to believe in them.  And instead, I see shadiness and a lack of trust.  And it just leads to disappointment.

       So, I'm awake and I know that I shouldn't be but I am...and I went to bed feeling really really bitter.  Feeling like I was frustrated and tired of being taken for granted.  And how some things are okay but they're really not.  And now, I'm wide awake when I'd give anything to go back to bed...ARGH!

       Busy morning already... I'll blog about my dinner last night...but first of all CONGRATS to my lil sis Maggie LaBranch for acceptance as Golden Gate University Law School Class of 2007!!!!  I'm so happy for you ~ you deserved it and you're amazing, intelligent, beautiful and now you're going to LAW SCHOOL!!!  WOOHOO!!!  And as a side note...got this in an email.. "Guys are like a box of crayons.  Some are bright, some are not, some are sharp, some  are dull, some are broken when you get 'em.  Sure, they can color your world, but they're  still just one more thing to clean up at the end of the day." -- Sue Paskey, to Marlene Orr  And then, last night...well Kuan picked me up and we found decent parking on Oakdale and then, we watched Batman Returns (I'm telling you..Tim Burton and Michael Keaton make a great team...batman isn't supposed to be suave and sophisticated.  He's supposed to be awkward - that's why he needs an alter ego as Batman - reference - see Spiderman and Peter Parker...see Superman and Clark Kent...no superhero is cool and accepted in real life - that's why they hide..or as my ex would put it "Only Donna would love superheros and comics because in real life, they're dorky but they have this super cool alter ego"  Anyway..and then, we took the Broadway bus down to  urlLink Geja's Cafe  and YUM... we started out with the Geja's Special Edition Cabernet Sauvignon and then, we both got the Beef Tenderloin Special - me with chicken and Kuan with the scallops.. started off with their Geja's salad which was yum and cheese fondue with bread, rye, apples, grapes - YUM...the cheese fondue was sooo delish! And then, Kuan and I got our main dish and we could barely finish it - it was sooo good and we got 12 dipping sauces - YUM!!  There was this pot of boiling oil where we cooked our veggies and potatoes and meat/seafood..omg, it was sooo good. And then, we topped off dinner with coffee and chocolate fondue...with marshmallows (since they had orange liqueor on top with flames) so we could roast the marshmallows and pound cake and strawberries and fruit...omg omg omg..YUM!!  We pretty ate until we burst.  *^_^*  So, I guess that the boat cruise wasn't a total loss...oh, well.

        urlLink http://www.valara.com  You see that link - I bought two boat cruise tickets for the Sunset Package back in September.  For catered food...open bar....live band...beautiful scenery plus fireworks over Lake Michigan.  However, they pushed it back to October due to overbooking.  And then, in October, they canceled because the weather just got too cold.  They started up again in April and then, I scheduled something but then, they pushed it back to due to cold weather.  I didn't want to plan anything in May because it was so crazy for Kuan and me so I had it scheduled for June 10th and they mentioned that they have fireworks so I got all excited and I paid an extra $10 just so we could reserve a spot.  The day before, they call me and tell me that not enough people signed up for it....so they're pushing me back to June 16th.  FINE.  That's TODAY btw...and then, they informed me that there is a thunderstorm warning so now, they're pushing my cruise back to June 30th.  GRRRRRRRRRR.....*sigh*  I just want to go already...

       This is dedicated to three men in my life..three men who honestly truly loved and do love me...One will always be left to the past...one had the true love of friendship and one who is my love of the present and the love of my future.  For all those times you stood by me For all the truth that you made me see For all the joy you brought to my life For all the wrong that you made right For every dream you made come true For all the love I found in you I'll be forever thankful baby You're the one who held me up Never let me fall You're the one who saw me through through it all  You were my strength when I was weak You were my voice when I couldn't speak You were my eyes when I couldn't see You saw the best there was in me Lifted me up when I couldn't reach You gave me faith 'coz you believed I'm everything I am Because you loved me  You gave me wings and made me fly You touched my hand I could touch the sky I lost my faith, you gave it back to me You said no star was out of reach You stood by me and I stood tall I had your love I had it all I'm grateful for each day you gave me Maybe I don't know that much But I know this much is true I was blessed because I was loved by you  You were my strength when I was weak You were my voice when I couldn't speak You were my eyes when I couldn't see You saw the best there was in me Lifted me up when I couldn't reach You gave me faith 'coz you believed I'm everything I am Because you loved me You were always there for me The tender wind that carried me A light in the dark shining your love into my life You've been my inspiration Through the lies you were the truth My world is a better place because of you  You were my strength when I was weak You were my voice when I couldn't speak You were my eyes when I couldn't see You saw the best there was in me Lifted me up when I couldn't reach You gave me faith 'coz you believed I'm everything I am Because you loved me  I'm everything I am Because you loved me

       well...yesterday was nice.  I first dropped off Kuan's drycleaning at this one place on Broadway - I always go threre cuz dress shirts are only 99 cents apiece and all articles of clothing are only $1.50 apiece.  Anyway, then, I had a busy day at work...still am busy but Kuan picked me up at 4:50pm...went to go pick up his dry cleaning...dropped stuff off at my place cuz we found good parking...and then, we walked like 1.5 miles down Belmont and hit up Flat Top Grill and I was sooooo disappointed.  :(  Maybe it was just me and the stuff that I picked out but yeah....I was disappointed.  Guess that Kuan and I won't be hitting up there again.  But yeah - Pompeii's next time, babe.  Afterwards...we walked along and Kuan took me into DSW Warehouse cuz I've never been there before and he insisted that it was my namesake so I had to go there...got a pair of cute white shoes which will be perfect for my Wednesday night boatcruise....then, we rented a movie "Along Came Polly" and enjoyed that...and then, just cuddled together goofing off and giggling and being "us".  Things have been a lot better since he left that one field marketing job.  It was just hard seeing him work so hard for 100% commission where some days it'd be good and some days it'd be super crappy.  *sigH*  He had a job interview last Friday and he's got one today at 2pm.  I have my fingers crossed for him.. I just want him to feel stable..and happy.  There's something about being able to wake up next to him and being enveloped in his arms...something endearing and something warm and fuzzy :-P  I'll stop now....  On a side note....the more time we spend together, the more I get to know what our future holds..how we'll interact...how we plan and envision certain things.  Okay, back to work now...

       I feel so accomplished...not only did I go to an aerobics class today...I did my laundry and my grocery shopping plus I made tacos!!  And I even got mounting tape and finally put up my Monet and Van Gogh prints...and then, I went to the Blues festival in chicago....so wonderful.  It reminds me of two summers ago lying in the grass with a glass of wine...  Now, I'm home - my next door neighbors are arguing which is kinda a killer to my mood but I'm listening to some more jazz and blues...     How to make a Donna Su Wang        Ingredients:   1 part intelligence  1 part crazyiness  3 parts joy        Method:  Stir together in a glass tumbler with a salted rim.

I bought a bottle of wine and he was like "Oh, on Sundays, we don't sell wine"....I'm like WTF.....and then, I ask him for $10 since i'm using my debit card and he's like "FINE..."...and then, I ask if i can get the $10 in quarters and he's like "NO.  I can only give you $1 in quarters" and then he proceeds to give me $9 in ones...and then, he has to break open a new roll of $10 worth of quarters and I asked for that roll and he was like NO....so I had to go somewhere else to get my quarters to do my laundry.  Blah.

       I wish that I had the chance to say goodbye and hug you one last time for a long time.. I know that it's not forever but it seems like a long time and a far far trip. It's just hard knowing that you won't be a free phone call away nor a plane ride away. But with everything, I know that you'll be fine and hopefully everything will be perfect.  I wish you a safe journey...and hope to see you again soon.

       So I haven't blogged this week - I can't help it.  I've been super super busy with work.  Tuesday...I was in the office from 8am - 7:30pm...Wednesday (was that only yesterdaY?) I was in the office from 8am - 9:30pm...and then, today, I've been here since 7:30am and will be here until 9:30pm...  I'm tired.  I'm stressed...I'm crazy busy - that about sums it all up.  And I'm being emotional and really frustrated over all this other excess stuff in addition to work.  *sigh*  There's some family drama going on, as well - well, family emergency and responsibilities, more like it.  I'm trying really hard to separate different things in my life.  Someone accused me of being too business professional and not enough personal.  And right now, this is helping me function best right now.

       It's funny...since I didn't get much sleep last night, I was dozing off to another nightmare..*sigh* and someone called me and luckily woke me out of it.  Kuan said that last time he was over and I had a nightmare..I was twitching and hooting like an owl and he had to wake me up.  Anyway, the phone call was from someone in my past and I guess that it still surprises me to this day that he still tries to look out for me and check up on me from time to time...  The previous song was dedicated to three men - and he was the first.  Now, to fall back asleep.

       I've been busy busy busy at work this whole morning..it's somehow already 2pm and my whole body is a dull ache and my head is a dull ache.  Due to lack of sleep..or rather, two broken hours of sleep, my shoulders and neck are achey..my right knee hurts...my right wrist is achey and hurts....my left side of the neck hurts, and I have a temporal headache.  Is it lack of sleep?  Stress?  Lack of energy and hunger?  I'm not really hungry.  I made myself a sandwhich so I ate that but my body still feels really blah.  And on top of that, I feel like my new haircut leaves my neck open and vulnerable and prone to damp wind.  Plus, it's POURING rain outside.  *sigh*  I'm debating if i want to take the bus home or just walk the mile in the rain.  Plus my new Nine West shoes gave me two nasty little blisters.  Bleah.  I'm not sleepy but I would like to crawl into bed and hide from the world and my wrist hurts a lot.

       I had a really decent weekend...I gotta spend time on Friday with some good company catching up with a friend..had a weird incident with a wine bottle with a wax seal on it..kinda like a wax cork.  Did a bunch of business and Saturday was being nice and polite...etc.  Not bad....and thanks to DJ for the haircut...I just feel bad that the highlights didn't turn out the way you wanted them to.  *^_^*  Don't really want to talk about family stuff right now tho...and btw, we celebrate August 8th for Father's Day because we're Chinese..  So...last weekend I went out shopping with Kuan and his sibs and we hit up Nine West and I saw the pair of shoes that I really liked on sale from $69.99 to $49.99....so today, I decided to hit up the Nine West Factory by my house and I see the price sticker that it's still $49.99 and I decide that I'm going to splurge and I'll buy them...so when the lady at the cash register rings me up, she's like $24.99..and I'm like "I'm sorry - you made a mistake" and she laughs at me and points at the sign that says 50% off of sandals...and i'm like OMG REALLY??  It really made my day.  *^_^*  NAB 2004-2005..someone called me the old fountain of wisdom and called me the OG of the group...haha...I'm super excited for this year and how everything is going to turn out.  OG, eh?  I'm the youngest yet I'm the OG.  *sigh*  Oh, well.  It'll be a good year.

       Just suck it up...I keep on telling myself that.  I've got three more hours and then, my Structural class and then, maybe more work?  I'm not sure yet.  Maybe - probably since I haven't done too much since I got in besides respond to a bunch of emails.  I'm sore...this morning, I took the 3.5 mile Lincoln Park trail along Lake Shore Drive.  I usually love heading north on LSD because then, I run along the Belmont Harbor and it's really pretty (one of the perks about living only a block and half away from the Lake) and this run really drained me.  I was achey and sweaty and gross.  Did I mention how I lost my Bally's card and how I'm miserable because I don't want to pay $10 to get a new one so I'm searching through my entire house to find it and I'm resorting to working outdoors again, which is nice but sometimes, I miss the solace of the gym.  Three day weekend...*sigh*  It sounds so nice and I'm very much looking forward to it.

       Sorry, peeps....I got a couple emails from people asking how the boat cruise went and how my family is doing...so, here's the update for now. We're definately selling the house but there's a couple of obstacles in our way.  The application for the apartment went through - I loaned my mother $2,000 and wiped my account pretty close to dry.  My family actually started moving stuff over to the new apartment yesterday.  It's pretty far into Palos Verdes - it's past Hesee Park and I guess that part is considered to be Rancho Palos Verdes and it's further away from the high school.  My mom is doing better - she's really looking forward to the Chicago trip for Labor Day weekend.  Hopefully we can fit the whole family in my little studio.  I'm trying to get Grace to fly out, as well.  We'll see what happens.  I miss that kid.  Actually, I miss my whole family.  The hardest thing about living so far away is being far away from the people that love you.  As much of a second family that I have out here, it's not the same.  My family will always come first and have loved me before anyone one else.  As much frustration as they give me, I only get frustrated because I love them.  Enough said.  The boat cruise...was "interesting".  I was freaking out cuz this lady told me that we had to get there in advance and we ended up taking a cab instead of public transportation.  We stood in line for 45 minutes and I pretended like I knew how to play chess with Kuan - I actually had no clue what I was doing and even let him eat my queen.  The cruise ship was very disappointing - half the size of the Spirit of Chicago (reminder - if you ever plan on going on a cruise ship, don't skimp, every bit is worth it) and the entire ship was very very crowded.  The drinks were alright - the white zinfindal was yum but the chardonney wasn't so great.  The food pretty much sucked.  On the Spirit of Chicago, the food was like catered appetizers.  This time around, it was like KFC chicken and potato salad - bleah.  Very very disappointing especially since we paid $120 for this.  But on the up side..the music wasn't too horribly bad even though he never did play the songs that I had requested.  But the view was breathtaking..(I'll post pictures up in a little bit)..the fireworks were amazing and Kuan even danced with me a little bit, too.  So, overall - you've got the pros and cons - what else can you expect?  Afterwards, we had some trouble catching a cab but eventually, I found one.  End of story - lesson learned: never going on the Valara VI again...but Lake Michigan is still beautiful under the fireworks...*sigh*  from 1994 to 2004..wow, it's been 10 years.  Now, back to the crazy hectic schedule of work...on a side note, Tim Kim just called me to tell me that he's in town - gotta miss that kid and our crazy Spaceset days.  *^_^*

       Sometimes...when someone apologizes to you...you can't help but wonder what they're apologizing for and if they really understand why you're upset at them.  I get upset when people are in a bad mood and take it out on me.  I admit...I am a bit of hypocrite because I do the same thing....  But it's frustrating and it hurts when I get snapped at and I'm not too sure what I did wrong.  And sometimes, I'm quiet because I'm crying.  I understand that it's one thing to vent but it's also another thing to only focus on the negative and think that you're perfect.  Well, you're not perfect but that's fine with me.  I accept you and love because you're not perfect.  I just want you to be aware that no one else's life is all fluid and hunky dory...and you do have it a lot better than a lot of other people...you just don't appreciate any of it at all.  It could be worse..it could be a lot worse.

       It's been a busy day - my morning just kinda flew by...I'm sleepy and I don't know why.  I got a decent six hours of sleep last night and I had a decent breakfast and I only had some bland noodles for lunch - not terribly filling but it'll do, especially since tonight, we've got that dinner boat cruise and it has a buffet.  Yum!  I guess that I am excited about tonight - I just hope that it all works out.  As soon as Kuan gets here, we'll have to take public transportation over to the Harbor by Soldier Field.  I'm trying to decide if I should change.  I'm wearing this black collared blouse with a beige knee length skirt with these black shoes.  If I change, I'm debating on a dress - haven't quite decided though.  I'll figure it out.  Oh, yeah - I went to a tanning salon for the first time yesterday and I guess that it went okay.  I was debating if I wanted to try it and at least check it once in my life.  Hope that I don't get addicted or anything but I'm planning on going back again on Thursday.  I just want to look somewhat healthy and without that pasty pallor that I've developed from being inside all day long during the summer time.  And I was bad...I hit up the Victoria's Secret online sale and got some stuff....now, I'm definately on budget since I loaned my mom some money.  I guess that I got so excited that I managed to be under my budget and had an extra $200 that I had allotted myself.  Whatever that is leftover now, I'm going to put in my new savings account.  I was so proud of myself - on Monday, I went into Bank One and opened up a new savings account.  Kuan may also be opening up a Bank One account, too, but we'll see about other things that are going on in his life.  On a side note, I lost my Bally's card and maybe I misplaced but I'm such a forgetful person.  I'm pretty mad at myself cuz I wanted to go to the gym last night but I couldn't and then, I wanted to go this morning but I can't.  WAH!!  Maybe I should just spend the $10 to replace my id card.  *sigh*  Oh, well..life goes on.  Which reminds me...I should get a new ID card at the Taste of Chicago this weekend since they do it for free instead of having to wait in line at the DMV.  Which reminds me..I need to get my driver's license.  All the driving schools are so far from the city - it's so annoying!!  *sigh*  So many things to do...I don't even know where to start.  *sigh*

       No one ever said that loving was easy.  No one ever said that it'd be a fairy tale.  Whether it be a love between parent and child or the love between one and Christ...or even a love between two friends..or the love between a man and a woman.  Today's talk inspired another talk...and it brought on more thinking...and of course, thought inspires writing.  I always hope that writing it out will help me sort out my feelings, my emotions.  I don't know what I'm feeling right now.  Weariness....fear intermingled with frustration...and a dabble of sadness...disappointment, I guess.  My mom mentioned today that she's glad that I'm learning how to 'tse cu'.  Yes, I know that I'm stubborn and I'm first-born and I like to have things my way.  Which person doesn't want things to go their way?  Which person doesn't want to be right?  Oh, well...this is me, for better or worse.  I never said that I was perfect - in fact, I'm so far from it.  When you say that you love me...do you really love ME?  Me with all of my flaws...me with all of my bad habits..me with all of my mistakes..me with all of my insecurity and fears?  Someone once said that the words of love were hard to come by but words of hate were so easy to produce, except that we deceive ourselves.  Sometimes, our naivete allows us to trust and fall for things easily and we want to love so badly that we lead ourselves into hate.  I know that it's wrong of me to hate..but sometimes, disappointment will lead to sorrow to anger and then to hate.  I don't hate right now but I am feeling that disappointment and sorrow right now that someone could claim to love and then, not uphold responsibility and when everyone needs him so much, he'd let them all down.  When we need him to be strong, he's just running away.  Sometimes, you need those downs to appreciate the ups.  Sometimes, you need to let go to really realize what you have.  And sometimes..sometimes, it has to hurt to realize that you really do care about someone.  What an odd world we live in...twisted and estranged.  And life goes on...one step at a time.

       I guess, an update on the family and what's going on.  I just spent the last hour on the phone with my mom.  First of all, her surgery is postponed until mid-August.  We're still looking at selling the house but there's so much stuff that needs to be done.  Anyway, currently - the grandparents are staying with my dad and the kids are going to stay with my aunt if anything else comes up - at least for the summer.  Apparently, he's been hired for another year contract with the government in Vegas and he's looking for something a bit more stable.  He's looking to buy a condo or a townhouse by the end of this summer.  Then, the grandparents are going to be with him until November, and then, they'll return back to Taiwan for a little bit and since they applied for their permanant residence, they can't be out of the country for too long.  Anyway...my mom decided to hold off on buying a condo in PV and she's going to rent for a while and she's looking to move either by mid-July or beginning of August.  Anyway, we're dealing with selling the house and repairing the roof and a new paint job.  I'm returning in mid-August to take care of things at home.  Apparently, I need to arrange for a garage sale and get rid of all of these things or we'll just end up donating them to the Salvation Army.  And I need to help tie up some loose ends.  I just wish that I could help out more.  My mom and I also talked about my future plans and goals.  It's nice to know that she's supportive of my dreams..well, except for one.  She wants me to work full-time even with a family and kids.  I don't know how likely that is going to be and how that's going to go over with me.  We'll see....we talked about a lot of things.  We talked about Kuan...we talked about Kuan and me...we talked about my career...we talked about her "grandkids"...we talked about me buying property..it was one of those good talks that comes along in a blue moon but it was overall a good one.  i think that she's trying to sell me more stuff but if I just ignore that, overall...I guess everything will be okay.  It's been a hellish week but with the downs, the ups will come soon enough...just one step at a time.

       Simple weekends are always the nicest...Kuan's mom's birthday was on Friday so I went with him to pick out a gift - we ended up making a picnic basket for her - he picked out the wine (Beringer White Merlot - we're part of the Beringer wine club) and I picked out this really cute basket with these different compartments and we got some cheese, sausage, different crackers, nuts, cookies, and chocolate.  The Su family is really cute when it comes to birthdays and I'm really flattered that they always include me in on their traditions, plus they like throwing me a little family birthday party when my turn comes around, too.  *^_^*  It's very sweet and cute.  Mr. Su was making all the kids kiss their mom and taking pictures of it, and Vince was being a little shy.  :-P  It's really wonderful how they always include me in; Mrs. Su wanted a hug and kiss from me and wanted to take pictures with me, too.  It was really cute and wonderful - it made me miss my family and wish that we were all a bit closer together so we could do things like that instead of all of us being so spread apart.  Other than that...Kuan crashed over the whole weekend- both Friday and Saturday night...Saturday, we watched Dodgeball with his sibs (cute movie...entertaining and funny) and we hit up this Evanston festival...I got these three Maiison Ikkoku books on sale!  *^_^*  Usually, they're like $17 each but I got them for only $6 each.   And then, Vince, Kuan, and I hit up the Bally's in Morton Grove..I ran about 4 miles - 1 mile to warm up and 3 miles was part of my workout...worked on my abs...After that, we headed back to the Su house and I got to help BBQ while Kuan sat on his lazy butt and watched tv.  :-P  I finally read The Da Vinci Code and people were right..it's really hard to put it down.  But some good stuff definately :-)  I think that I'm in this reading mood.  I want to go buy more books.  I'm thinking about collecting the whole Maiison Ikkoku series.  I also want to buy the Notebook and read it since some people have been talking about it.  Today, Kuan and I stopped by the Gay Pride Parade and got some food and just sat out in the park for 2 hours talking and eating and just ...being us.  *^_^*  I lay out in the sun and napped for an hour - I think that I burnt my shoulders...but that's okay.  Now, I'm trying to figure out what's left in my day and what else I want to do today......

       Well...as of next Monday, I'll be buying a new computer - something basic and simple.  Funny - two years ago, I would have wanted the best gaming system out there but I guess...the techie in me just isn't quite the same.  I'm looking at actually purchasing a system...*GASP*  I know..I would have loved to build myself one...probably better and cheaper than any system that I could purchase but fact is...I don't know what's out there anymore.  Sad, huh?  I haven't kept up to date with all the new gadgets and toys out there.  Yeah - I'm putting the PDA goal aside..maybe Christmas, I'll spoil myself with it.  :-P  I realized that I need my own personal computer more than ever.  I have a laptop right now but it's kinda dying on me (It's an OLD Compaq) and I have an ibook that work gave me but it's work-related and it should stay strictly work related instead of me storing any of my personal stuff on it...  Things that I want on my new computer but my Dad says is more of an extravagence than a need... DVD and CDRW (Dad says that a CDRW is more than extravent), Flat Panal Monitor (Dad says that I shouldn't be worried about space), 80+ GB of harddrive space (Dad says that 40GB will be fine and it's not like I really need it all for my movies and mp3s), as much RAM as I can get!!  (Dad says that 256MHz is more than enough), 256MB Memory Key (Dad says to get a floppy drive and use that - bleah, a floppy can only hold 2MB), video card (Dad says that I don't game as much as I used to so that's a waste - I should just use the video card that comes with the motherboard)...  As you can see - my dad is trying to make me more conservative and I guess that I should be...but this will probably be my computer for the next 5-7 years.  (I usually only have a computer for about 3 years before I try to upgrade..heehee)  In the same token, I realized that I will need to get myself a desk and chair so I'm not sitting on the ground with my computer on my coffee table...I just realized.  I don't know where I'm going to put everything - guess that I still have time to figure it all out.  Even if I do buy the computer next Monday, it probably won't arrive for another two weeks.

       So, I just finished The Wedding by Nicholas Sparks and it made me cry...made me sniff a couple times throughout the book..made me mist up in tears a couple times...and three times while reading it, I started crying...and when I finished...I had goosebumps and tears in my eyes and gave myself a good ten minutes to bawl.  heehee...I feel so girly :-P  Wonderful book - I thoroughly enjoyed it and as much as I can dream..and I know that this probably sounds really racist but it's a "white person romance"...I dunno - traditional Asians just aren't like that.  I really cannot picture my dad trying to "court" my mom after 30 years of marriage..trying to win her back so she feels like she did when they first got together.  I just can't.  When we give her roses, she always says "Why do you give me cut flowers that are going to die in a couple of days?"  Most traditional Asians aren't raised to think "romantically"...at least in "American" standards (have you ever thought about how in Chinese, "white people" directly translated means "foreign country people")  I'm starting to get racist so I think that I'll stop now...

       yeah, so I've been posting a lot...today's been one hell of a day. Well, at least - this afternoon and it's only been three hours but it's been bad news one after another...... What hurts and confuses me the most is that I feel even more isolated - more than ever.

       Okay now... a month ago, I was freaking out because I weighed the most that I've ever weighed in my entire life...when I moved to Chicago and after working at NCSA for a year, I gained a whopping 15lbs and then, after working at PCOM, I gained another 10lbs... I'm pleased to report that after a month of working out and eating healthy...I have lot a total of 11lbs *^_^*  And I'm happy to report that by using acupuncture and drinking herbs, 6 out of the 11lbs was from that.  I currently have seeds in my ear and drink at least three cups of the herbal tea a day.  Yay me!!  I've decided that I just need to lose 14 more pounds and I'll be happy, and feeling more secure about myself physically.

       I know..I owe a huge picture update but you'll have to be satisfied with this one picture that I took with my camera phone.  For some weird reason, Kuan and I both look drunk in all of our boat cruise pictures...   Sorry about the poor quality but I'll try to upload some more later..

       I'm thinking about dropping completely out of the program that I'm currently in.  The state just changed its laws and the school added 145 more classroom hours to meet the law which means a whole year more that it'll take me to finish the program.  It doesn't seem worth it to me anymore.  When I know that it'll take me two years to get a license when I'd rather spend two years going through a part-time Masters program and at least, get that.  I have until today at 5pm to make up my mind....there's just so much going through my head right now and I feel emotional.

       I forget why I couldn't sleep Friday night but yeah, I couldn't sleep.  On the up side, I found my Bally's card.  I stayed up all night and was cleaning my entire place - scrubbing and mopping, etc - until 7:30am and then, fell asleep for about 45 minutes before they started construction on my apartment unit...ARGH!!  And then, I popped in a movie and worked on some personal stuff until noon.  Around noon, I headed off to the Clark Graham Cracker Comic Book Shop for Free Comic Book Day and bought all this Elfquest stuff and the last issue of Maison Ikkoku...Kuan came over and we hit up comic book shops for our free comics and the awesome discounts...I stocked up on Elfquest and Maison Ikkoku and a couple other things, too - Gen13, Fushigi Yugi, Spidergirl, Batman, Dungeons and Dragons, etc.  Then, we went back to my place to read all of our comics...then, we went off to the Buzz - where Kuan and I kept on going at those free drinks from 10-11 *^_^*  Good seeing all of the people that came out - I only wish that I could have seen my grandlil since she made it out there but we had to get going because Winfield was crashing over and we didn't want him to wait outside too long.  I got to be Leng's wingman and dance the night away :-P  even tho the guy that she was talking to bought me a drink so I'd go away.  Sunday...woke up and made my lil bro and Kuan omelettes and then, since we were still so full, we went to Biograph Theatres and watched White Chicks...I'm going there from now on - even tho the theatre wasn't that great and they only show three movies at once..student discount is only $4 and general admission is $6!!  Then, we hit up the Taste of Chicago..crowded, the usual Taste.  Then, Wiinfield went his separate ways and Kuan and I dropped by his house to grab some stuff and we headed off to Evanston and found ourselves this little grassy area and with my blanket, we lay out and watched the fireworks right above us...sweet....  Monday - woke up and dragged Kuan out to his first acupuncture treatment - I got my own treatment for weight loss so now, I have these seeds in my ear and I'm drinking this diet green tea which makes me go pee a lot.  Grabbed lunch with the boy...came home to TWELVE Maison Ikkoku videos on my front doorstep which made me SUPER happy *^_^*....started watching them.  After 6 of them, (6 hours later) I headed over to Bally's since I was so happy that I found my card again and spent an hour there...came home...made dinner, showered, ate and finished watching the other six videos.  *^_^*  I spent 12 hours watching my anime..heehee...but then, when it was time for bed around midnight..I coudln't sleep and ended up not sleeping until 4am - I wrote in my personal journal for seven pages...even went out for a run in the rain...got soaked and took a hot shower..finally fell asleep in tears...Bindu texted me at 6:15am so I got online to chat with her a little bit and couldn't get back to sleep so I ended up going out to Bally's again and then, here I am at work.  I'd rather not go into details about what's going on with me right now personally...and how I'm feeling or why I'm emotional...maybe later but not now.  Just feeling super sh*tty right now - that's all.

       Well...it all started on Tuesday...I chipped the back part of one of my teeth...it had to be the tooth that I got my root canal done on last summer....and then, an hour ago, the middle part...where it covered my root canal...fell out.  Ack.  :(  Anyway..I guess that means that I'm just going to have to hold off on my computer and fix this tooth first.  *sigH*

       Well, it's 8am and I'm already at work now.  I got here at 7:50am since all of my clocks are 14 minutes early and I wasn't really thinking clearly since I'm so tired.  I woke up at 7am yesterday and left my house at 8am to do some marketing stuff for outreach for work...I'd go more into details but I had this long post all typed out about it in detail and how my whole day went and why I feel so tired but explorer crashed on me...so maybe later...work is boring to talk about anyway...so I'll just talk about my Kuan time.  after all that, just met up with Kuan..and we kinda did some more wandering of our own.  We were looking for this one plaza but couldnt' seem to find it.  Hit up Jamba Juice cuz I was thirsty and you should try their new Lime It Up smoothie...really good - it's lime sherbert with strawberries and mango, too!  I couldn't help thinking how it would taste at Joy Yees with boba...Kuan was hungry so we hopped on the Red Line and hit up Ricobene's near Chinatown but I didn't really eat much - just stole some bites from his steak sandwhich..headed back up on the Red Line..Kuan wanted to check out a couple stores - he didn't buy anything but I got this cute purplish skirt at H&M for only $5 *^_^*  gotta love sales...but after that..I was soooo tired that we went back to my place - I had to cancel plans with Ericka and then, I got a package in the mail - six more volumes of Maison Ikkoku - I got so excited that I started watching one and Kuan watched with me - so cute - I finally got him interested in my anime..heehee..got hungry after one episode so we hit up Rice Box - yum tonkatsu!!  And then, went home and watched four more episodes but sadly enough, I was so tired that I fell asleep during it..*sigh*  Anyway...it made sense because by that time, it was almost 2am..so we fell asleep and then, woke up at 7am to get ready for work and Kuan dropped me off at PCOM and then, he headed home.

       As my feet pound the pavement, I can't help but think...back straight, shoulders back, arms in 90 degree angle...loose fists...heel toe heel toe..don't slam your feet into the ground...heel toe heel toe to absorb the shock.  Funny how 10 years ago, that's all I heard and now, I still say it to myself.  There's something about working out in the morning - the first thing you do...the fresh air...the newness of the day...so much to do and so little time.  And life goes on, I guess.  I checked my email before I left and that one crazy girl got a new email address and she's back to bombarding my inbox about more info about my ex.  I just want to leave the past in the past - especially when he hurt me as much as he did..his lies and his deception were so sugar-coated that I don't know what I can believe or remember from our past.  I'd rather forget it all and move along and I wish that she'd respect that...and also respect that it's been three years ago and some things need to be buried in order for me to move on.

       Volumes 29 and 30 came in the mail today!!  *^_^* I can't figure out why I like reading/watching it so much..it started in sophomore year of high school and I kinda abandoned it throughout college and now, I'm back to it again...I guess..the best way to describe it....is as a typical chick anime - romantic comedy sort of thing.  I don't know what the attraction is...perhaps it's that this woman loses her first love and he dies...and somehow, she's able to overcome all of that grief and sometimes, people can be patient and the silliest things and the simplest things are what we need in life.  And the most heartfelt things are the ones that we leave unsaid.  And somehow, she has an option of falling in love again...and it could be the good-looking rich older man or it could be the poor younger college student.  I'm not going to give it away but it puts things in perspective sometimes.  *^_^*

       It always suprises me to hear that couples that I know are currently breaking up.  Makes me sad, if anything.  It always sucks to hear it from the one who got dumped and got their heart broken.  It's another thing if it's a mutual break-up or if it's you that initiated the break-up.  I remember the first break-up that hurt but I was so young - still in high school and our relationship was one of those..."stereotypical high school" things...where we were both co-captains for the varsity track teams and we looked cute together.  It hurt back then because I didn't understand why he didn't want to be with me anymore.  But it didn't take me that long to get over him...I guess the first real hurt was when my longest relationship ended and I understood why but it still hurt.  I want to honestly say that it took me over a year to really get over him.  I dated guys before I was ready to and I didn't have anything serious because he still occupied a large part of my heart and I was still healing.  It's hard to hear a friend cry...and tell you how she had so many hopes with this guy and how it was all dashed against the wall.  Or have a guy tell you how he was planning to propose to her and she cheated on him and made him lose all trust in her...but it always makes me reflect on my own relationship...

       It's Friday night and I know that I should go to bed early because I have to be at work early tomorrow.  So many thoughts going through my head...really random thoughts, too. Last night...I dreamt about a guy from Canada and another guy from Texas..and Kuan was there, too, but for some reason, I was living with the Texan and the Canadian lived on the same floor as me..just a weird senseless dream.  Today was a tough one at work.  It had its ups and downs...Fall 2004 looks to be a very promising semester for the Chicago campus, but at the same time...I had my 'obstacle' to overcome today, as well.  Patience and tolerance...and swallowing my pride and trying to be open to criticism and change...that's all it took..now, if I can just get through tomorrow.  and lastly...I want to write about it but I know that I shouldn't....so I'm going to resort to good old fashioned pen and paper..

       I couldn't sleep last night..and this morning, felt sad after waking up.  I dreamed about my family coming to visit me and we were driving up to some place in Wisconsin.  And I dreamed about Robert and Leandro being there...and when I woke up, I was just overwhelmed with missing them.  I want somebody to share Share the rest of my life Share my innermost thoughts Know my intimate details Someone who'll stand by my side And give me support And in return He'll get my support  He will listen to me When I want to speak About the world we live in And life in general Though my views may be wrong They may even be perverted He'll hear me out And won't easily be converted To my way of thinking In fact he'll often disagree But at the end of it all He will understand me  I want somebody who cares For me passionately With every thought and With every breath Someone who'll help me see things In a different light All the things I detest I will almost like I don't want to be tied To anyone's strings I'm carefully trying to steer clear of Those things  But when I'm asleep I want somebody Who will put their arms around me And kiss me tenderly Though things like this Make me sick In a case like this I'll get away with it  I have that Somebody..but sometimes, he doesn't realize it.

       Okay, I've calmed down somewhat...and I'll write about my nice evening and some tidbits on my weekend. I finally sold my little tv set and after that, I was running some errands and ran across this garage sale and saw this really nice computer desk with a hutch for only $50..and since I was only 4 blocks from my house and there was wheels on the bottom of the desk, I bought it and wheeled it home.  After that, Kuan picked me up and helped me go pick up my new entertainment set.  :-)  It's really cute..  Anyway - last night, Kuan and I hopped on the 151 towards downtown to see a free advance movie screening of Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle.  *^_^*  Not bad actually..I was expecting low brow cheesy humor but it was actually amusing and had a decent plot.  And then, afterwards, we grabbed some dinner at Chipotle and at my place, we had a really good heart to heart talk.  The talk was really good...*sigh*  Let's just leave at that because that makes me content.

       I had a lovely evening last night - I really did...and I was going to write a nice blog about it.  But then, I got into work and my whole day is going down the drain.  I'm re-thinking certain things and I'm reconsidering other things now.  I cannot work under dictatorship and with someone who is not going to listen....to reasoning and who thinks that her word is law.  Shady shady shady business - just going to leave it at that.

       I sound like Garfield.  I hate Mondays...after a long and tiring day at work, I get home and it's almost 7pm. I go to the gym and work out for a solid hour...come home...and I'm still perturbed about some work stuff...so I go out for a run along Belmont Harbor and Lake Michigan..come home and shower and check email...and if this day could possibly get worse, it just freaking did.  I've already got all this to stress over and now...damn it.  This weekend has the possibility to turn into one of the worst weekends possible.  I worked out and now, it's time for another method of dealing with stress.

       And in this crazy family of ours...sometimes, Grace just drives me bonkers but lately...for the most part, I love that little kid to death.  *^_^*  She totally made my day yesterday just chatting away with her about our crazy family and how only we could understand the family drama that we go through and the craziness of it all.  She also made my day by telling me that she was bringing a dvd player for me when she comes to visit in Chicago.  I can't wait...the Wang family reunited back in Chicago - as crazy as it sounds - it feels good to have that to look forward to.  We haven't all been here since 1995.  Wow - that was nine years ago...I want to show them around the city but I'm sure that they'll take off and go to the suburbs (Darien) for a day or something.  Maybe the parents can go and the sibs and I can just roam around downtown.  Cindy and Steve have no recollection of Chicago and Grace gets an occasional taste of it when she comes to visit me.  I miss my family - as crazy and kooky as they are, they're family.  I'm thinking...gotta take them to Chinatown for some Joy Yees..yum.  There is the Jazz Fest going on that weekend - fun *^_^*  And I'll probably take them around my area for some of the yummy local eats, as well.  Not sure how much sightseeing they really want to do - the parents probably just want to see their friends and hang out.  The sightseeing is more for the two younger ones...I really hope that everything falls through and I get to see my family soon.  ....

       I woke up this morning feeling kinda sad - not really sure why but I just did.  And then, by the time that I got to work, the feeling just kinda remained and then, to top it all off - I feel like I'm being pulled in all these different directions.  Like some kid's playdoh that he just forgot about after stretching it out.  I think that I either need a good workout after work or I need a good cryfest.  Both should make me feel better..now, if I can just get through today.

       Sometimes...Reality just takes over.. and you think about how much everything costs.. You calculate - how much each class costs you every day....and if you miss a class - how much money are you throwing away?? How much does each day in my apartment cost me?  And if I go away for the weekend - how much money did I just throw away? And if I eat out this once during the week - how much will that cost me a month in the long run? You calculate the things that you want and the things that you need...and then you take into consideration how much bills and everything else costs...and then, you take into consideration how much you can really save up.  And then, it makes you think that you need to cut out all the fun things of life in order to 'tse cuo' and make it really work out.  But then - everyone tells me that I'm only young once and it's bad enough that I make myself older than my twenty-two years.  And sometimes, I do feel older than just twenty-two but sometimes, I feel exactly my age.  I don't know if that makes any sense.  I've been living away from the parents for almost eight years...I've been budgeting and working for longer than eight years.  I've always held a job - well, between NCSA and PCOM, i had a week off but that doesn't really count because I got paid for that one week of unemployment.  And then...the other important things to take into consideration.  Love...and own's Future. I want to go to graduate school....but which one?  My dream program would cost me a fortune.  And when?  When is the most appropriate time to go back to grad school?  I feel like I should be stabilized in my career before pursuing higher education, but then..would I be putting my job on the line?  Is it worth paying for the name?  And then...you've got Love to throw into the whole mix.  I love Kuan.  Pure and simple like that.  What I have and have experienced and am experiencing with him is something completely different than anything else that I have ever had.  In the sense that I know that I can't imagine my life without him.  Everyone seems to ask about the M word and other stuff..Maybe...I'd like to hope that we will start heading down that path but Reality Check.  MONEY.  I hate how Money runs the world.  How we'll need to save money to buy a house together...how we'll need to save money to even have a wedding...and don't even start with how much kids cost....and a part of me tells me that it's a long ways down the road, and there's always ways around it BUT I feel like I'm in at an empasse.  So, which comes first and what should follow...graduate school?  engagement?  stabilizing my career?  marriage?  buying condo?  house?  kids?  I guess...when it all comes down to it.  I'm not so sure what I want right now...just kinda confused where everything should fall into place.

       So, Thursday & Friday, I have this GAPSEMC (www.gapsemc.com) conference to attend downtown Chicago - should be interesting - hopefully useful for work.  At least they feed me.  *^_^*  Good thing..I won't have to hear from certain people and it'll be a mini break from everything that's been going on in my life.  Other things to look forward to...tomorrow night, my elementary school friend - Gina, and I will be hitting up Gamekeepers (Lincoln & Armitage) for their 10 cent jumbo wings - yummy!!  I'm definately craving them plus hanging out with Gina is always nice.  I can't believe that we've known each other for so long - she mentioned that our junior high school 10 year reunion will be next year.  Crazy stuff.  Btw - tomorrow - from 5-8pm, at all Coldstones locations, a FREE slice of oreo ice cream cake!!  Friday night, I'm going to take Kuan out to House of Sushi (Ashland & Belmont) - $10.95 for all you can eat sushi - definately looking forward to that.  :)  And then, Great America on Saturday..not really looking forward to that though.  *sigh*  I have motion sickness and a fear of heights = fear of roller coasters but Kuan likes going...and he'd rather go there than go camping.  *sigh*  The little sacrifices that we make to make our significant other happy.  Sometimes......never mind.  I guess - food makes me happy - good food for a cheap price makes me even happier, I guess.  And if that's the only thing that I can look forward to, so be it.  ...craving Joy Yees... :-P

       I dread next week -haven't quite figured out why - just dreading it alot.  Maybe it's also because work is getting super crazy and there's all these deadlines that I need to meet and the pressure is on again.  We'll see, I guess.  There have been cutbacks and I guess that I should be grateful that it didn't affect me personally.  Other than that, the temporary crown is really digging into my gums so it's bleeding again.  Bleah.  Last night was nice but I felt really out of it.  I can't fully describe it but I feel 'quiet'.

       So, I can't feel half of my face and I've got that achey feeling on the right side of my face.  And the whopping bill for the crown and the post, etc came out to $766.  Luckily, my dentist only made me pay 50% today.  I'm officially very much broke until next payday.  I've got some money that I've set aside for hanging out with my biggie today but at least, we're watching a free movie screening...I'm hanging out with Gina so I've got that much set aside, too.  This Saturday, I'm treating Kuan out to Great America since he deserves a little mini-vacation.  So, I've got that all budgeted, as well.  And then, I gotta hold off until the 5th of August which I think that I can handle.  And then, I'm back to the dentist again on Friday, August 13th - dun dun dun...blah.  I feel kinda nauseated and dizzy but maybe that's normal - who knows.  I hate the dentist with a passion - probably since I have my mom's side of the family...who all have crappy weak soft teeth.  Bleah.  Okay...back to work and budgeting my life.

       I did it!  I turned in my two weeks today and I feel so much better now that I finally made a decision.  My heart and mind are happy with this decision and I don't feel so torn anymore.  I will definately miss what I currently have and the people around me, but things happen and life changes.

       Right now, I'm so torn....I know that other people can tell me what they think and ultimately, it's down to me.  My decision.  I just wish that I felt in one particular way.  I wish that I knew what my heart thinks and what my mind wants me to do.  I wish...I had the right answers.  *really really really torn and emotional right now*

          Maybe this is turning into a yearly thing but all I know is that I had so much fun both times.  *^_^*  This time, more fun than last year, too.  Kuan slept in so we didn't leave Chicago until 10am and there was a Cubs game going on so there was mad traffic - we stopped at McDonald's to grab some brunch - so weird - we haven't had fast food since Convention's In 'N Out - all part of our diet.  Then, we fought through traffic and got there around 11:30am.  As soon as we got there, I wanted to figure out some way to cut lines because I'm so impatient and I hate waiting.  So, we see this deal called Fast Lane so I drag Kuan into the line for it and btw, it was very much worth it!  *^_^*  even though Kuan was complaining that we should have just jumped in the line for the Whizzer.     Then, we waited in line for the Whizzer since the Fast Lane was limiting us to how many rides we could use it on.  Not too bad...even though I still screamed my lungs out - I hate roller coasters and heights and I get motion sickness.  Then, Kuan dragged me over to the Viper and in my dizziness afterwards, he somehow convinces me to ride American Eagle BACKWARDS....and then, I'm feeling woozy and he drags me over to Iron Wolf where I'm standing and he LIED - I went upside down in a loop - OMG.  Yeah - so after that, we go on something simple...Splashwater Falls where we got soaked.  Kuan decided to wait on the bridge to get even more wet!  After freezing on a nice hot day, we sat through a show - Extreme Espana which just made me freaking nervous watching them jump through the air.        So, after the show, Kuan suggested that we go get more wet and we headed towards Logger's Run and after getting drenched, he ran off to ride Batman but since I wore flip flops, I opted out (I was kinda hoping that since I wore flip flops - Kuan wouldn't make me ride all those rollercoasters - guess that I was wrong) and since he used the Fast Pass - he was on the ride immediately and I just chilled outside for 10 minutes.  Then, we finally decide to get some food from this Cajun place which was ehh..and really pricey.  Would you believe that a bottle of pop was freaking $3 and a bottle of regular water was like $3.25 - crazy expensive!     After that - we took a picture in the new Mardi Gras section..we hit up the Bumper Cars and whatever Kuan says, I rocked him!!  And then, he went on Superman - by this time, it's like 7:50pm and the Fast Lane tickets expire at 8pm so I ended up scalping my tickets to this random couple and made a little money back.  By this time, it's slowly getting dark so we decide to take it kinda slow and head over to Carousel Plaza.  And I even got Kuan to ride on the horsies with me!!  Yes - the Midwest Lambda Phi Epsilon Governor on a pony!!            Afterwards, we watched the sunset on the Sky Trek Tower - which was like 285 feet in the air!  And then, we headed over to the Stargate SG*3000 which had changed quite a bit since last year - definately rockier and more nauseating - I'm telling you - it's all mental - ack.  After that, I wanted to win something...so Kuan and I played around and he won me a puppy!!  Which was promptly named "Puppy" - yeah, we're not that creative.  :-P    After he got me the puppy, I was so happy that I let him take me on Whizzer one last time before we left.  The-End.  A wonderful, fun, eventful day running around like teenagers at Six Flags Great America.

       I'm going to do a separate post for Six Flags Great America... but anyway - with Leng's suggestion, Kuan and I hit up House of Sushi on Belmont/Ashland/Lincoln and omg - it was sooo worth it.  $10.95 for all you can eat sushi.  I could only handle five rolls but Kuan was a trooper and finished seven.  And we usually don't eat Japanese because we can barely get full and if we do, it usually costs us a bundle.  Other Japanese places that I've been to that I like here in Chicago include Kamehachi and New Tokyo.  It was really worth every last penny - for sure, we'll be hitting that up again.  It is somewhat walkable distance from my place but the walk was worth the way back home because if we didn't walk, we would have definately slipped into food coma.
