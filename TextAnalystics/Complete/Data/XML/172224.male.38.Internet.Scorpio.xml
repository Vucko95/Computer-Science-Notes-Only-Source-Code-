      The traffic this morning was really heavy, presumably because of the tube strike, and I ended up turning around and finding an alternative route to work. There was a piece on the TV this morning asking whether tube staff should have the right to strike or not. Personally, I feel that the right to strike, given sufficient grievance, is an important one and I wouldn't want it taken away from these people, but I do wonder whether their action is fully justified in this instance. As far as I'm aware, they're well paid for what they do and their dispute seems a trifle petty. Of course, I'm not directly involved and thus I'm not in possession of all the facts but that's my opinion based on what I do know.

      Not much to see here today, but if you're in the mood for a really great web comic, allow me to recommend that you give  urlLink Penny Arcade  a try. It's been around for  ages  but it's still dead funny and, if you have the time, a troll through the archive is bound to turn up something that'll put a smile on your face.

      I took a trip on the bike to  urlLink Kentwell Hall  yesterday. They had around 250 people dressed in Tudor costume and demonstrating all manner of things, from bakery to blacksmithing. The coolest thing of all was the camera obscura, a room with a lens in one wall, projecting an image of the world outside onto the opposite wall.  Since the weather was so nice I didn't bother to take my waterproofs with me, so naturally the heavens opened on the way home and I got soaked. Still, at least it happened on the way home rather than on the way out, so I was able to simply get changed and relax in front of the TV once my journey was over.

      I'm one of the few people who are actually glad that the England team have been knocked out of the Euro 2004 championship. Perhaps now we can end the hysteria and get back to some semblance of normality.  What  is  the matter with people? You'd think from the reaction of some folks that someone had died. Ah, but wait - we can all just transfer our dreams of sporting glory to the sodding Wimbledon tennis championship. And then there'll be the Olympics. Oh joy.

      While a part of me really admires the guy who's just  urlLink set a new record  of 100 hours for the 5,632 mile trip from Alaska to Florida, another part of me wonders if he isn't just a tad insane. Especially bearing in mind that shortly after he'd started out he was forced off the road, breaking not just various bits of the bike but also of himself. I'd have given up at that point, I think, but then I probably wouldn't have taken on this kind of lunacy in the first place. I admit it, I'm a (relative) wimp.

      Yesterday I sympathised with cyclists but today I witnessed a display of fuckwittery which caused me to reconsider my feelings. I saw someone cycling in the road, right next to a bloody cycle path, with both hands off the handlebars and holding a mobile phone to his ear, while a van tried desperately to get past him. I've been trying to find a suitable word to describe this particular idiot but I can't think of anything strong enough.

      The weather that's typical of the season has reasserted itself. In other words, the skies are grey and the rain's pouring down. I spotted a number of fairly miserable-looking cyclists this morning, one of whom, clad only in a t-shirt and shorts, looked particularly unhappy. It made me very glad that I was kitted up in a full set of waterproofs. I managed to feel somewhat superior when I arrived at work to see people making a dash from their cars to the building and getting throughly soaked while I strolled casually along, remaining completely dry. Well there have to be  some  advantages to riding a motorbike on a day like today.

      For the moment at least I've gone back to using  urlLink Blogger . I'm even using one of their standard templates for now (shocking, I know!) until I get a chance to design something of my own. I have no idea how long it'll take but don't hold your breath...

      Not much in the way of posts this week, I'm afraid, as I'm on holiday and too busy enjoying myself to want to spend time writing about it all. I will say that I went to see Spiderman 2 the other day and I agree with the critics that it's  much  better than the first one. Anyway, things'll probably be back to normal next week.

      Yesterday I saw quite possibly the most tasteless thing ever so, naturally, I thought I'd share it with you. Proudly displayed in the window of a funeral director's shop was a blindingly white coffin with the cross of St. George on all faces and the England football team's badge in the middle of the lid. The sad thing is that there are many people who'd think this is the coolest thing ever and would love to be buried in it. Terrifying. Truly terrifying.

      Last night I went out with some of my colleagues, who can best be described as a finely-honed drinking machine. To say that I was drunk would be a bit of an understatement - I was absolutely legless. So much so that when I went to the toilet the staff wouldn't allow me back in the bar. I'm not entirely sure how I managed to make it home. I remember doing it but it still seems like a miracle that I didn't end up in Glasgow or somewhere. If nothing else, it served as a very good reminder of why it's not a good idea to drink a lot on an empty stomach. I won't say 'never again', but I suspect that it'll be a while.

      I'm staggered that anyone can still think like  urlLink Godfrey Bloom seems to . He may claim to be in favour of "men's rights" but he certainly doesn't speak for me. I will admit to having enjoyed the occasional sexist joke, both at the expense of women and of men, but this guy doesn't appear to be joking and that's unacceptable as far as I'm concerned. I just don't have the words to express my outrage that someone like Mr. Bloom should hold a position of authority.

      I spent the weekend in  urlLink Bristol , firstly at  urlLink Ashton Court Festival  and then just wandering around with friends. I have to say that the  urlLink cathedral  is truly impressive, particularly the Chapter House. I could have spent a long time just sitting in there, soaking up the atmosphere or, if there had been nobody else about, singing a few songs and enjoying the fantastic acoustics. I was pretty exhausted by the time I got home, and essentially just collapsed in an untidy heap, but it was well worth it.

      According to the BBC, there's going to be a  urlLink shake up of the rail system . Now, while I welcome anything that stands a chance of improving rail travel in this country, I'm not convinced that this is going to help. If I had my way, I'd renationalise the entire rail network. It's a public service and should be publicly owned and run and, while it should be run as efficiently as possible, it shouldn't be expected to make a profit. If by some miracle it manages to do so, all the money should be invested in the rail system, not paid to shareholders and top executives.  I guess I've nailed my political colours firmly to the mast with that little speech, but that's fine with me. I firmly believe in the freedom of the individual but I also firmly believe that the state should be responsible for infrastructure and public services. Businesses have their role, but they shouldn't be allowed to run the country.

      I keep eyeing up the cycle paths by the road as I travel to and from work. My plan, when I can afford it, is to buy a cheap bicycle and use it to get to and from the office. Maybe not every day but certainly quite often. It's only seven miles, which is short enough to be practical but long enough to do me some good, as well as helping out both the environment and my wallet. It's been many years since I last owned a bike but, as they say, you never forget how to ride one.

      My good friend John got into an argument recently which led to him declaring that he'd spend a weekend living as a homeless person. He's just emailed me with his report, which I reproduce here in full. I am now freshly scrubbed and washed but still feel a bit grimy. No ..... perhaps 'depressed would be a better word.  I left home at about three o'clock on Friday in 'suitable' clothes and started to walk up towards the West End. I took the opportunity to acclimatise myself to what was coming and started to approach total strangers and ask if they had any spare change. Now I am not trying to stereotype anyone here but I was given more by working class youngsters than anyone else. I got into a bit of a row in Canning Town with a street type who accused me of poaching on his pitch and he gave me a clump and shoved me along. I reached the embankment at about eight thirty and sat down on a bench for a much needed rest. The view across the river was nice and peaceful and I suppose that I must have dozed off for a bit because some young copper was poking me in the ribs and saying "On your way, grandad" ... fucking cheek! I wandered up along the Strand and into Aldwych before I went into a McDonalds to spend what I had begged on a burger and a coffee. As they were serving me one of these tossers behind the counter had the nerve to say that it would DEFINITELY be a takeaway. They even asked to see my money before they asked what I wanted.  I found a small bench in Kingsway and sat down to eat and I was soon joined by a young lad in his twenties who asked if I was in a sharing mood. We were eating and talking to each other. I explained that I was a bit new to it all and that it was my first night. I had some elaborate story prepared but he just accepted me at face value and asked what sort of a day I had experienced and how much I had earned. His name was 'Jay' and he has been living rough since he was thirteen (he was about nineteen or twenty now .... he couldn't remember). We sat there asking passers by but were mostly ignored so we went back towards the Strand as the theatres were kicking out. This time we were more fortunate and amassed about fifteen quid. I think that what upset me the most was that people would simply do what I normally did and were totally oblivious to us. As far as they were concerned we simply did not exist. Seeing it all now from a different perspective I realise how wrong my attitude was. We went to the back of the Strand Palace Hotel and earned a coffee and a couple of sandwiches by clearing up the rubbish and they agreed to turn a blind eye if we wanted to sleep by the rubbish bins as long as we were gone early. We settled down out of the rain and carried on talking. As if it weren't bad enough to have to live like this these kids have to put up with nocturnal gangs who like to beat them up and take their earnings along with anything else that they fancied. I was told to avoid 'city types' when the pubs were kicking out as they liked nothing more than to beat up on beggars and to even try and set them on fire if the mood took them. It seems that the girls had it worse as they were often assaulted as a matter of course without any retribution.  We agreed to sleep in shifts so one of us could keep our eyes open for any trouble. At about two in the morning we were joined by a young girl of about eighteen who was in a bit of a state. She had been with her mate who had been dragged into a car by some Asian guys. When I asked why she hadn't gone to the police they looked at me as if I had come from another planet. It seems that the police simply aren't interested in street going's on unless they are having a 'clean up the street' initiative. She was waiting for the drop-in centre to open on Saturday morning so that she could tell someone there. Here I was sitting with the two of them who were younger than my own kids and listening to them explain the facts of life to me. A life that I have to say that I found totally incredulous and so very alien to everything that I believed about how human beings treated one another. I felt myself starting to cry for them and their wasted lives. They felt that no one on earth cared about them and the most surprising thing was that they were probably right about it all. NEVER have I missed my own family so much.  The security guard came out at about half past five and asked us to piss off because the guests were starting to wake up. We walked down to the drop in centre just off Tottenham Court Road and waited for it to open so that the girl could go in there (I never even found out her name). It opened at about seven and we went in for a hot drink whilst she said what had happened to her friend. I spoke to the guy who was working there and explained that this was all a bit new to me and in the next hour I found out about things that are far too outrageous to repeat here or anywhere else for that matter.  Saturday was a repeat of the previous evening. Jay liked to stay around the Strand-Aldwych-Charing Cross area as he felt safer there and knew all of the best places to catch tourists and hide from those who would do him harm for a spot of fun. He also knew which coffee shops would part with a drink and a sandwich for some work.  I came home this morning after walking back through the night. I had left Jay sleeping at the back of the Strand Palace. How can these kids cope with the sheer unadulterated misery of it all? Their lives and potential were simply being totally wasted for the want of a decent system of coping with them. There are some volunteers who do a spanking job here but - why should it be left up to volunteers? After bathing and shaving I shoved some clothes and a decent flask into the car and went back up to find Jay but I just couldn't see him anywhere. I gave it all to someone else who looked like he needed it. I tried to give it to a young girl who just backed away from me as though I was an alien.  Now, I have been a bit economic with my descriptions of it all as I just don't have a vocabulary that is adequate enough to do it all justice. Instead I would simply ask two things of all of you ........ Firstly, please don't just pass a beggar by.  Secondly, no matter what happens within your own families, do whatever you can to make sure that your own kids NEVER end up like this. I have had the kids round to lunch today and I just wept when they came in and I held onto them for the longest time. I wouldn't let go of Elizabeth Louise for about a couple of hours. In the end I think that I was scaring them so I told them about my weekend and what I had seen and heard. I was amazed to hear that my daughter does voluntary work for a homeless shelter in Maidstone as she had never mentioned it before.  Our young people are the legacy that we leave for the future so let's all do what we can to make sure that there futures are as happy and as safe as we can make them.  Normally I try to end these ramblings on a happy note or some smart quip - I just can't find it in me to do that at the moment.  John I can add nothing to this.

      Over the weekend I witnessed a couple of guys retrieving pizzas from the rubbish bins behind a pizza restaurant. I most sincerely hope that they weren't intending to eat them (although I'm not sure what else you'd do with a pizza) because I'd not long seen a large rat near those very bins. It makes me shudder just to think of all the nasties they might contract.

      I'm currently reading a book by a guy named Tim Moore called  urlLink French Revolutions , which is all about his attempt to cycle the route of the Tour de France despite being totally unfit and knowing very little about cycling. It's one of those books that makes me wish that I was a writer - clever, charming and very, very funny. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a good travel book or, indeed, a good laugh.

       urlLink New religious hate laws planned . While I have some concerns over protecting people's right to make reasonable jokes or to debate and criticise, on the whole this is probably a good thing. It does seem to me, though, that it would be far simpler, rather than having separate laws to deal with racial and religious hatred, to simply make it an offence to deliberately incite hatred against any individual or group. This would need to be worded appropriately, so that freedom of speech was maintained, of course, but that's always the case with this kind of law. A proper debate and a bit of common sense should see to that, although I suspect that may be beyond the present government.

      According to  urlLink Yahoo , Ken Livingstone is having talks with Bernie Ecclestone over the possibility of a London Formula 1 Grand Prix, to be held, Monaco-style, on the city's streets. I'm not convinced that a suitable route could be found as most of London's streets are way too narrow but if it could be done I'd be very happy indeed. If we can't manage Formula 1, perhaps we should aim at MotoGP. Seeing motorbikes speeding through the streets at 200 mph would certainly be spectacular, although I suspect it'd never be allowed. Probably just as well.

      I've just been watching the French Formula 1 Grand Prix and, although it was won by Michael Schumacher, it was still a surprisingly good race. F1 has been very dull of late, with Schumacher winning virtually every time, admittedly in part because he's a superb driver, and it would be very nice to see somebody else on the top of the podium instead. Maybe the British Grand Prix will offer up some surprises.

      Yesterday I did something that I should have done a very long time ago. I joined a trade union. I've always believed that it's a good thing for working people to belong to a union, even if their employer is wonderfully benevolent and pays well over the odds. It helps to ensure that they remain that way, and gives the rest of us who work for more or less average employers some protection from their worst excesses, as well as access to useful resources regarding matters of health and safety, employment law etc. So, the next stage of my task is to persuade a good number of my colleagues to join as well. Even if they don't, I still feel that union membership will be beneficial for me, but if they do it'll give us some clout when it comes to negotiations with the company. That's the theory, anyway.

      As I was riding my bike over a flyover this morning, I looked to my left and saw the most wonderful sight - a large vee formation of Canada geese flying parallel with the road, at the same height and speed as me. It put me in mind of one of those BBC wildlife documentaries where they film birds that have been trained to follow a truck, so that their forward motion is removed from the picture and you can see how the birds' bodies move as they flap their wings.  Incidentally, as a small child I discovered that if you feed plain chocolate to Canada geese it goes straight through them. What a delightful kid I wasn't.

      Considering the  urlLink appalling behaviour  of the company, I've decided that I won't buy any Penguin books until they do the decent thing and I urge you to do the same. I'm flabbergasted at the appalling disregard for the rights of a private individual shown by this massive company and I hope they get what they deserve.

      Resurfacing roads is, on the whole, a good thing. The problem that I have with it, however, is that the new surface is almost invariably higher than the old one but the manhole covers are at the same level. This leads to what are, effectively, large and often quite deep holes in the road which at best are uncomfortable to ride over and at worst can cause accidents, either by causing motorcyclists to fall off or by causing them to swerve around them. The problem appears to be becoming very widespread; almost the entire route to work (about seven miles) is full of these wretched things. I should write to the local council and complain, and maybe I will.

      As part of my holiday I went to the  urlLink Cambridge Folk Festival . The sun shone, the beer was good and the music was, quite simply, superb. Highlights included Tom Robinson (he of 1970s '2-4-6-8 Motorway' and 'Glad to be Gay' fame) who was fantastic and had everyone jumping around and singing along. I managed to get myself nicely sunburnt but I came home very happy indeed. What more could you ask from a holiday?
