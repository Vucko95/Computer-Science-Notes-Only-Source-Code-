      in my dream (see my previous blogpost) after the second plane crash, i remember rushing to a telephone to call an emergency number but somehow not being able to recall any numbers to call. this was right after the plane crashed into the open field, right before i saw people starting to come out of the wreckage. maybe this is me realizing there's actually no one or nothing that can help the situation at hand.  the band's going to have a meeting at my house tonight perhaps to discuss recent events and get ourselves organized. that should be fun.  the commute to work today was ok enough (read: MRT was not as crowded so i got to sit down). but getting a ride to the MRT station was hell. daming tao!!! i should learn to get out of bed when my alarm sounds, and not put it on snooze after the first one and sleep for another ten, fifteen minutes. ah sleep, blissful sleep.

      i had a dream about airplanes crashing from the sky today, hence the name of my blog.  in my dream, a small airplane crashed first, it landed in a grove of banana trees near a house. it was daytime and the sun was out. apparently no one was on the plane. it crashed, cartoon-like, nose-first into the ground, complete with smoking fuselage and bent wings and tail.  later on in the day (it was darker) another airplane crashed in to an open field near where the first plane fell. this second plane was a bit bigger and somehow i knew, as it was plummeting to the ground, that there were passengers on board. this plane crashed to the ground violently, and burst into flames. the good thing was, people survived. looking back, it was actually strange to see the plane's captain come out first before any passengers. he had a bloody nose and was wearing a life vest.  thoughts in my mind were: whoa, two airplanes crashing near where i was in the same day! (shades of 9-11 eh?) very weird. i recall going back to inspect the wreckage of the first smaller plane, and seeing Domino's logos on it and thinking, 'what? domino's  flies  its pizzas out now?'  that was my unconscious dealing with ene and andox quitting the band within a day of each other. ene (my band's now-ex-manager) on friday, andox (our now-ex-roadie) on saturday.  andox was the first airplane, the quit-crash apparently less emotionally traumatizing, as depicted by its size and relieving lack of flames and bodily injury ( no people on board, remember?). he was an excellent roadie, easily the best one to have worked for us. always ready to assist, always ready to act, hence the domino's logos on his plane. much like domino's, andox delivered.  as you may have guessed, ene was the second airplane. her quit-crash was more significant because, as i may not have realized earlier, her involvement in my band was accompanied by a weighty emotional investment on our part. we so want a good manager that her quitting was a great blow to us, she was so good at it. so i guess her quitting the band was more traumatizing for me (and maybe for my bandmates). i think ene burned herself out managing us, hence the flames and violent crash. the captain got out first, too, and maybe that symbolized her in a way, because the captain was supposed to keep everyone from crashing. but she bailed out first and left us, her passengers, to fend for ourselves. but the good thing was the passengers were alive -- ene and the band were still on speaking terms. maybe it was a good thing for her to leave. maybe she just wanted to still be friends, and not let work ruin our friendships. we were friends with her, after all, before she became our manager.  i don't have an explanation yet for the andox-plane crashing first and the ene-plane crashing later because the actual sequence of events happened in reverse. ene left first, then andox.  more on this later.

      i love driving. big red (our big, red, hilux surf) is easy to drive (lakas humatak!) but hell to park. yesterday i brought big red to the office, then to crame. from crame, went to the loop to meet karen and winnie for coffee. after coffee, karen and i convoyed to n. domingo in sta. mesa to drop off winnie. from there, we convoyed to karen's house in cainta. whew! talk about long drives!  my route for that day: diliman qc (house) > mandaluyong (work) > cubao (crame) > west triangle qc (coffee) > sta. mesa (winnie drop-off) > cainta (karen's) > diliman qc. no wonder late na ako nagising kanina. oh, i also got a chance to watch part of Blow (Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz) on HBO and part of a Red Hot Chilli Peppers in Ireland concert on WOWOW.  galing ng RHCP. very few three-piece-with-a-throat bands sound that rich live (except maybe Nirvana and the Jimi Hendrix Experience). more later.  actually, this is a pathetic attempt to become an 'active' blogger, so i can get the GMail offer. i'll take 1 gigabyte of free email any day. so sue me.

      finally, after days and days of time-consuming debate, congress in joint session have approved the rules for canvassing the election returns of the May 10 presidential elections. talk about taking their goddamn sweet time. god help us if they don't proclaim someone by the end of the month. methinks the title of  neal h. cruz 's column hit the nail on the head:   urlLink Proclamation: Better late than wrong  . *facepalm*  >>>   conrado de quiros , in  urlLink his column today , wrote something about the power of showbiz over politics, focusing on the results of the senatorial race. here's  urlLink my take  on the same thing.

      i hate going to the office on a saturday.  you see, at the company i work for, it's policy that the first and last saturdays of every month are work days. so two saturdays out of four in a month, i have to drag myself out of bed and tell myself: 'get your sleepy a$$ to the office!' the work saturdays cut in to quality time with my girlfriend big time. and they cramp one's proverbial weekend style. instead of being able to plan some r&r for a friday and a saturday, one is  dissuaded  from staying out too late. but sometimes -- most of the time -- i say f**k that, i wanna have some fun, and stay out anyway.  perks are that i get weekend overtime pay for work on saturdays. plus traffic's not too bad on saturday morning. oh well. you can't have your proverbial cake and eat it too.  >>>  the gig last night was fun, though the band that played just before we did was a hard act to follow. although there were still a good number people in the crowd, one cannot help but notice considerable thinning in the ranks as a three-song set progresses.  i shouldn't have been surprised, though. a half-hour before our set, the emcee was calling out the names of the bands playing and there were loud screams after each name. when it came to our name, the screams were a bit softer. maybe the crowd were thinking, 'okay, we don't really know that band but let's just scream for the heck of it cos we had a good scream-rhythm-thing going.' :S  but it's always good to see a few fans in the audience really singing along with our songs and getting a good head-bob or pogo going. cool! but it really gives me a warm fuzzy feeling when fans muster the courage to come up to me and shake my hand or high-five me and say, 'pare, astig kayo!' or have his copy of our CD signed. that, in a word, rocks.

       urlLink the band 's mailing list party was great, though there weren't that many people (aside from the bands) at culture club. that's 5 bands including us 4+5+4+4+5 equals 22 people. heheh that might have been half the crowd right there.  but seriously, i had great fun playing monday night. that was one of the better gigs we've played in a while. come to think of it so was  urlLink LFS  last night. it's great to have those gigs where one plays efforlessly -- when my instrument and i are one, when my guitar's tone is spot-on and i don't have to think about what notes to play. ah the high from playing music :) those gigs come few and far between. at most other gigs i'm just, well, not in the zone so it's a great feeling to get in there.  >>>  have i mentioned i'm tripping on  urlLink the pearlfishers '  the young picnickers ? the songs are so infectiously catchy that the CD was constantly in big red's CD player over the past three weeks. i'd been hearing their name from friends in-the-know, but this is the first time i've heard their music. ( picnickers  was released in 1999, for god's sake!) their sound is equal parts beatles, beach boys and burt bacharach (did i spell that correctly?). great sunshine-y 1960's sing-along pop songs. great for driving. great for singing along with. musical bliss.  >>>  i got 91.9% woohoo!   urlLink

      i hope the rasp in my throat goes away by tomorrow or saturday. it's goddamned irritating, and my voice is husky, and not in the  urlLink Rex Navarrete  way. strepsils lozenges (mmmmm, menthol) help relieve the irritation, but i my mouth gets really dry. i think it's because of the alcohol in strepsils' active ingredient. 'dichlorobenzyl alcohol amylmetacresol' doesn't roll too nicely off the tongue, though.  anyway, i need the rasp gone cos i do backup vocal duties for  urlLink my band . by the way, if you're free saturday night, come to Gasoline Alley at Robinson's Galleria. a whole bunch of bands from  urlLink Last Full Show  will be playing.

      it's hot today. so much for the cool rain.  &gt;&gt;&gt;  this morning saw FPJ leading GMA by a spread of 10,000 votes (per  urlLink NAMFREL 's not-so-quick count). this afternoon, FPJ widened his lead to just over 40,000. honestly i hope the trend doesn't last. not because i want GMA to be president, but because i don't want FPJ to be president.  i voted for my man  Raul Roco  again because i felt he was the most sensible choice. too bad he's last in the counts. i think he's what this country needs to get its act together.  i  did  consider Ping Lacson because i was impressed by his detailed and goal-oriented platform, but balked at the proposition of iron-fisted rule. i didn't give  Eddie Villanueva  a second look because was pushing the church too close to the state for comfort. as for  Eddie Gil , well, you just have to  look  at his toupee to know that he's a joke.  i voted Hermie Aquino as my vice president simply because i think only he would work best with Mr. Roco. i wanted neither Noli the fencesitter nor Loren the turncoat. i've been wondering: why don't we have the U.S. model for presidential elections where you get the president and the veep like a happy meal?  i think having to vote for the vice president makes for divisive politics. look at what happend with the Erap-GMA, and GMA-Tito Guingona combos. there came a point when the president and veep didn't see eye to eye, and the veep got 'reappointed' to the Department of Foreign Affairs as if it were a kindergarten classroom corner. if i'm not mistaken, that Erap did that to GMA when she was veep, and GMA did that to Tito Guingona just recently. you end up with the veep  really  being a spare tire, and not making any supportive contributions to administration policy.  i've forgotten the roster of senators i voted for, but it's on a piece of paper somewhere (that i hope hasn't been thrown away). here's the 11 i voted for off the top of my head: Mar 'Mr. Palengke' Roxas, Dick 'WOW' Gordon, Parouk Hussin (give our Muslim brothers a break!), Nene Pimentel, Jun Yasay, Pong Biazon, Robert Barbers, Orly Mercado, Frank Chavez, Boy Herrera and Heherson Alvarez. of those i voted for, the ones in the 'magic 12' are Roxas, Pimentel, Gordon, Biazon, and Barbers.  >>>  i just hope that as a country, we can get our act together soon. how's that for sunny optimism? :S

      yesterday, countless registered voters (me included) trooped to voting precincts all over the country to elect our next president and other national and local government officials. the media pundits all say this year's exercise was relatively peaceful and orderly. as i did in 2001, i voted Raul Roco for president, but he isn't topping the so-called quick counts. this morning the all-popular FPJ was leading the counts, followed closely by the diminutive GMA.  text exchange between me and kelvin:   chino:  kadiri leading c fpj  kelvin:  ...hindi tayo pababayaan ni lord. mandaraya si gma. &Uuml;   widespread cheating, anyone? if FPJ wins, he'll be the  second  actor we will have elected to the highest office in the land. geez. will the filipino poll body never learn?  last night, cnn reported that the 2004 philippine elections had a record number of movie and tv personalities running for office. that, with the cheating, pretty much sums up electoral politics in the philippines. this goes to show that the elections have been reduced to personality-marketing. behold the showbiz-ifying of philippine politics. or is it the politicization of philippine showbiz? argh. phenomenon, i christen thee  politainment .  is there no room left for intellectuals in politics? what's happened to the great statesmen of old?  >>>  my mom has been texting me since last night and she says that the results look bad for my aunt, who's running for a local position in their home province. oh well. she can run again in 2007. she will at least have the benefit of campaigning experience and hindsight.  >>>  the new blogger look is cool. so are the new templates. :)

      i was browsing through the  urlLink pinoyrock mailing list  this morning, and i came across a subject that read ' urlLink Joe Satriani  guitar clinic', and it was posted by Sir Mike Pedero (of tracks studios/nu107). i swear my heart leapt for Joe is my all-time guitar hero. because of a string of recent instrument clinics at the Yupangco building by Paul Gilbert, Billy Sheehan and Dave Weckl, silly me thought the great Satch would also be having his clinic here in Manila. but no. The big catch was that the Joe Satriani guitar clinic, according to Sir Mike's post, would be held at a music store in Hong Kong. rats.  i lamely thought about how i'd get to HK on the 27th and get tickets to the clinic:  chino (frantically, to self):  need a to book a flight. need to get those tickets. need to get a passport. damn. (do i need a visa to get into HK?)    but seriously, if Joe came to Manila, i'd buy tickets to his show in a heartbeat. i've been hankering for a great guitar show ever since the first G3 concert (Satch with my two other heroes Steve Vai and Eric Johnson) came out. there are many great guitarists here in Manila, but none of their caliber. i figure i'll a) shit my pants or b) cry like a baby when i get to see Joe (or Steve or Eric -- naks first-name basis na kami) perform live.  kelvin got to see Paul McCartney in Japan last year. lucky bastard. and yes, he cried. especially when they played the  Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End  medley.  that medley (from  urlLink the Beatles ' last album  Abbey Road ) is probably the most emotionally-pregnant piece of music ever committed to analog tape. i mean, even if you didn't know that the Beatles were breaking up, you'd figure it out just by listening to these songs. Even in  parts  of the songs are laden with emotion. Case in point: George Harrison's lead break in Carry That Weight is so musically perfect that no other guitar line can replace it. that's just the music. the lyrics are equally poignant, but i feel i don't have the literary mettle to tackle them here. just listen to  Abbey Road  to experience the sweet sorrow of the Beatles' last days.   And in the end the love you take Is equal to the love you make

      the stuff in italics is my comment on  urlLink neva 's latest blog. i figured, since it was long enough for my own blog, and i had spent considerable time on it, i'd post it here. so here it is.   hi. i just want to say that i can totally relate to what you're going through right now. i guess we're at that age when the once-unseen issues in our lives begin to appear in stark relief: our parents are not the gods we once thought them to be; our lives are not what we want them to be. and these realities hit home _so_ hard, especially the uncertainties we all face. as i'm writing this comment, i'm certain of a few things, at least. things, people and places are limited -- finite yet always changing. true unconditional love -- once you find it -- is constant, and is perhaps the only thing we can hold on to in our uncertainty.

      in case you're wondering, yes, we did get rained on -- mid-song -- at the myx event. same as with the F&ecirc;te, we followed 6cyclemind. which makes one wonder if we should ever agree to following them in the future ;) joke lang, guys. earnest perceptively noted that if you organize an outdoor event in the middle of june in the philippines, you're practically  asking  to be rained out.  but the organizers were kind enough to transfer us to camp yellow. hung out behind all the band equipment and took some pictures with  urlLink jal  and  urlLink maysh  before our turn to play.  so we  were  able to play four songs to the sizeable crowd on roxas boulevard. and, as if to reward me for all the hassles, there was a Mesa/Boogie Mark II Dual Rectifier half-stack on stage. SWEET! jazz later on noted that i did my windmill guitar stroke quite frequently. hands down, you can't beat the Mesa/Boogie-and-SG combo. you get an such  awesome  growling sound that you can't help but feel like a rock star. ah, bliss.  so with raging winds coming in from manila bay, we played  Happy Birthday, Buwan, NTS  and  Antipara . the seething damp masses showed their appreciation by moshing incessantly to each song. the crowd must have been sufficiently amped up by the other performances because they were moshing to  Buwan  and the relatively unknown  NTS . Saya! :)

      kahapon, habang naghihintay sa artists' tent kasama sila joey at jason ng twisted halo, merong lalaki galing sa audience na nagtatanong kung nasaan daw si francis. the guy was hanging out behind the waist-high tent divider. nagkataon wala sya non, so sabi namin wala sya. he goes away. later on, he comes back offering us some gin, showing us his bottle of Ginebra and a shot glass. no kidding. we politely refuse.  still later on, after the dawn had finished their set, the same guy is back. this time, he's asking for jett pangan. as in  JETT! JETT! 'SAN SI JETT?! HOW DO WE GET BEYOND THE BEND, PARE?  i'm like whaaaat?! pero astig din kasi alam nya yung song na  Beyond the Bend . which, no surprise, was the title of the dawn's second album. pero kakatawa lang that he said it that way. astig.  speaking of jett pangan... when he's back in the artists' tent, he's talking with his wife and jun-boy leonor and two other friends, and he notices me. so i walk up to him, shake his hand and give him a hug. i say,  solid ng set nyo, pare!  if i do say so myself, i was successful at suppressing my inner fan-boy. i  could  have gushed  alam mo, boss jett, i used to have a band in high school, and we used to do covers of Little Paradise, Saling Pusa, and Talagang Ganyan. and, ooh, your version of Jimi Hendrix's Purple Haze inspired me to play lead guitar in a band. you and your band have influenced me profoundly. ang galing mo kumanta! and, ooh, you positively rock as Pontius Pilate in Jesus Christ Superstar! i love you, man.   but no, i chose to go understated.  solid ng set nyo, pare!  sheesh.

      yesterday, i woke up to the sound of rain. (teka, kanta yun ng Skid Row ah...) still lying in bed, i thought to my self,  sana 'wag ulanin ang F&ecirc;te mamya.    1130AM  under cloudy skies,  urlLink echo  and i hurriedly shoved off to fetch jazz and head to eastwood to beat my 200PM hosting calltime and boldstar's 220PM performance call time.   12:30PM  got to jazz's house in the heart o' San Juan at only to find that he had left to bring a few things to his apartment. so we ended up just fetching jazz's bass guitar (he would be playing for boldstar in the afternoon show of the F&ecirc;te Rock stage). after getting lost in San Juan because i was an efficient navigator, we proceeded to eastwood via ortigas.   1:45PM  so far so good. with boldstar's car pass, echo and are the first to park our car at the artists' designated parking area. we head to via mare (F&ecirc;te headquarters) to get our artist id's and food/drink stubs. no luck.   2:00PM-ish  we grab a late lunch at 7-11. it's humid as hell.  hintay. (familiar ba 'to?)   3:00PM-ish  dahil wala pa si jazz tsaka si justin, echo, on jazz's request, asks me to play bass for boldstar's soundcheck. since we already had jazz's bass guitar, i gladly oblige :) we soundchecked  accident prone ,  bio  and  i love you . saya! if i do say so myself, i can play bass adequately. ;)  after soundcheck, (say it with me) hintay. jugs and jazz arrive later on.   4:00PM onwards  with a smattering of people in the audience, jazz, jugs and i hit the stage to start the rock stage pre-show. monsterbot christens the F&ecirc;te rock stage. francis brew (kiko) joins us in hosting the show. most of the bands that played were great. i particularly enjoyed the performances by grass, southern grass, hellbender, ciudad, monsterbot, boldstar, kjwan, happy meals, and greyhoundz. because of stage manager ene and staff's efficiency, the rock show runs like clockwork.   8:45PM  F&ecirc;te opening ceremonies. hosting duties are over. woohoo! i'm all amped up cos of the great rock performances, and am ready to perform myself. by this time, umambon na nang makailang beses pero mahihina't mabibilis lang.  the audience area is packed to overflowing. in the moshpit, there are punks with crazy foot-high mohawks, two guys with -- get this -- gas masks and a guy with a puppet (?!) may times na kinailangan namin silang sabihan na wag magsakitan habang nagmo-mosh kasi naging rowdy na sila lalo na sa sets ng chicosci tsaka 'houndz.  beer, yes. bottles, no.  at one point, habang sinasabihan namin sila, the moshpit clears a bit and a guy lays down in the middle, and smokes a joint! labo, mhen.   9:00PM  the rock stage main show gets under way with the dawn. solid din ng set nila! thank goodness still no rain.   10:30PM  while twisted halo rips up the stage, trici asks us to stand by for our set. andox tunes up the guitars, and we get ready.   10:40PM  6cyclemind hit the stage. with guitars in hand, we go to the performers' holding area. excited na 'ko, tututgtog na and itchyworms! sa wakas! in the middle of 6cyclemind's third song the rain suddenly pours. it's as if someone opens up a great faucet in the sky. the raindrops are big fat and juicy, just like in Neo and Agent Smith's final match-up in  Matrix Revolutions . i'm still hopeful that we'll be able to play cos ene and the RSL (sound system) guys let 6cyclemind finish their song.  to shelter themselves from the rain, a few members of the audience hurriedly clamber over the tarp that separates the holding area from the audience. yung iba, sumuot dun sa man-high passageway sa ilalim ng stage. yung mga kasama namin sa holding area, they start shouting  itchyworms na!  kakataba ng puso :) hehe, may fans pala kami ;)  finally, as if to end the anguish, ene comes down to the holding area to announce that the show has been cancelled because the equipment and the circuit breaker have gotten wet. bummer.  we wait a few more minutes for the rain to let up before hastily packing our things. tech-guy andox mistakenly puts jugs's bag, which contains jugs's cellphone, parking card, wallet and driver's license, in the trunk of kelvin's car. kelvin has sped off by now. jugs and i make frantic phonecalls to CDy and jenny. jugs tells CDy to meet him at mcdonald's. jenny tells us she's at mcdonald's and kelvin is meeting her there. jugs runs off to mcdonald's.  while echo fetches the unsold boldstar cd's at macau, i wait in big red. cold and more than a bit damp, echo and i finally head home. on the way out from the eastwood parking lot, we drop off  urlLink emma  in front of mcdonald's.   11:30  traffic outside eastwood is heavy but moving, so the ordeal lasts only about twenty minutes. habang nakasakay, tinamaan na ako ng pagod.   12:15  we get home. gusto ko pa sanang i-post kaagad dito yung nangyari, pero talagang lomi na 'ko. after a midnight snack, i go up to my sweet bed and pillows and conk out. zzzzzz...  sayang. this was our third year to be at the F&ecirc;te de la Musique, and our second to host the rock stage. di na nga nakatugtog, di pa nakapag-ikot. (last year, nakapunta pa ako sa venue ng jazz so nakapanood pa ako ng one or two jazz groups.) at least the hosting was fun. disappointment din na hindi nakatugtog ang Nuncy Spungen -- they had come all the way from Cagayan de Oro. they were great at our Last Full Show gig this past friday, though. the bands that  did  get to play were awesome. with so many excellent rock acts, how can pinoy rock be dead?  >>>  nga pala, my co-host francis brew told me yesterday na meron palang silang gamit na amps sa linkin park concert. nakatago lang sa likod nung risers behind some cloth. so much for my sonic abstraction theory.

      where i work, there's a gymnasium with covered basketball courts. on tuesdays and thursdays, the courts are set up for playing badminton. we had two courts reserved (under our bosses' names) for our use yesterday, but didn't find our names on the scheduled reservations list. so i go to the athletics office, and ask the supervisor. it turns out that the reservation was cancelled because another division needed to use the courts for a volleyball game. the super' says he informed everyone concerned in advance.  what pisses me off is that he suggested that the cancellation was justified because the people my boss plays badminton with (me, my other teammates) were project and contractual employees, and not regulars. so i asked what the difference was. he says  malaki ang difference no'n kasi the courts are for regular employees only. we are accommodating (sic) casual employees, but not legally. it's not policy.  i didn't argue the point, but it think that  sucks . big-time.  did i hear that right? bayanihan ba, 'ka n'yo? tssss.  it sucks that this company treats so-called 'casual' employees like second-class citizens. it sucks because it's the casuals -- like the maintenance men, the security guards, the food service staff, the assistants, the programmers (like me), the rank-and-file who, from my estimates, make up a significant percentage of the company's workforce -- who literally keep the proverbial machine clean, well-oiled and running.  don't think i'm petty because i wasn't able to play badminton yesterday. it's the principle behind it. i think i'm as entitled to use company property as anyone else, because i work here, too.  >>>   urlLink this is spooky.  note the last paragraph.  >>>  when my beloved  TechTV  was taken off the Destiny Cable channel roster, i was livid. i thought Destiny was trying to cut costs by 86-ing the TechTV feed.  The Screen Savers ,  Call For Help  and  Big Thinkers  were my favorite shows on that channel. it turns out  urlLink TechTV was acquired by cable TV juggernaut Comcast , and cancelled the channel.  urlLink read on .  >>>  pasensya na sa rant. on a lighter note, i was able to see  urlLink mikey  and  urlLink quark  again last monday for ciudad's first gig in a long time. they must've played a hundred songs. pero all in all, ang saya ng gig.  urlLink kathyg  was ecstatic the whole time. :)

      mabalik tayo sa  urlLink LP  concert, nasabi ko last time na they had no amps onstage with them. actually, uso na ngayon 'yun sa karamihan ng US acts. i've seen  Metallica 's  S&M  concert, and they had no amps onstage, just in-ear monitors.     ticket ko sa Linkin Park concert   i read in  Mix  magazine that  Garbage  do the same thing when they go live: they have Line6 Pods for each guitar, a kit sampler for the drums (the actual kit is just a mock-up with triggers), and another sampler/sequencer for the keyboards. these are all situated off-stage, and the members of Garbage have in-ear monitors. their engineer says that onstage, all you'll hear is Shirley Manson's voice. galing! talk about sonic abstraction.  the appeal of this kind of setup is it's very convenient. it gets rid of many sound-mix-related variables. for example, onstage amplifier and monitor levels need not compete. also, there's less equipment to deal with, such as cables: guitarists in particular can go wireless, and have the wireless receiver situated at the sound booth or somewhere off-stage.  however, the performers must have an extremely skilled sound engineer for an arrangement like this to succeed. he will have to manage switching among all the sounds each musician will use for each song. he'll also have to take care of all the instrument and vocal levels, along with any effects (reverb, delay) they use. he also needs to make sure that the onstage monitor mix is pristine and clear. that's a lot of work, but that's what sound checks are for ;)  when the band isn't worrying about the mix, they're freed up to do what they do best: perform. and when you think about it, that's what making music is all about.  sorry, i'm talking shop. baka si  urlLink jal  maka-relate hehe. astig sana kung lahat ng banda dito sa pinas pwedeng gawin yung ganun. kaso mo, mahihirap lang kami. ang mahal ng gamit sa banda! ;p  nga pala, kung dein nyo na-gets yung title ng entry ko kahapon, eto yon: sabi kasi ni mike shinoda sa isang part ng show,  itaas ang kamay , pero syempre may american accent. ayun, naaliw lang ako.  >>>  the dollar, now standing at PhP56.33, has just broken the PhP55.00 psychological barrier. sana hindi maging PhP100 = US$1 pagdating ng panahon. :s

      saya ng LP concert kahapon! perhaps the most striking thing about their live show is that their performances sound so much like those on their CD's. there were minor variations in timing and arrangements, but the overall performance was awesome -- very tight and clean. saya din ng stage moves nila! got to meet  urlLink ramon  after the show and from their posts, i know  urlLink kelley  and  urlLink jorel  were there, too. the lucky bastard ramon literally swam through the crowd just to get the drummer's drum stick, which had been thrown to -- but not caught by -- the crowd. astig!   Kwentong Linking Park Concert   2:15PM  i picked up karen at her house 'cos she had to be backstage early for the meet-and-greet (m&g). according to the LP underground confirmation email she'd received, she needed to be there by 3:45PM for the 6:15PM m&g. so hayun, kahit malabo [namimigay din kasi ng m&g passes ang NU pero kahit 5pm na sumipot ok lang, tsss] sugod kami nang maaga.   3:45PM  nasa kalsada pa rin kami. by this time, lumipas na ang pagka-high-strung ni karen dahil huli na kami. tsaka sinubukan ni karen na lagyan ng film yung kanyang 25mm camera pero ayaw kumagat ng film. bawal daw kasi ang digicam sa m&g. go figure.   4:45PM  dahil hassle ang traffic sa Aurora blvd, na-late kami ng isang oras. pagka-parada sa concert-goers' parking area, ako naman ang sumubok na ilagay ang film sa camera ni karen. ayaw talaga. kaya hayun, pinabayaan na lang ni karen. back-up na lang yung P800 nya, kung makakalusot.  dahil natakot kami na baka umulan, nagdala kami ng tig-isang jacket, isang folding umbrella, atsaka tig-isang extra t-shirt. na nilagay namin sa knapsack ko. yung CD wallet ko, nakalimutan kong ilabas sa bag kaya nakadagdag sa bigat. syempre ako ang nagbuhat.  secured big red, tapos deretso na sa pila. hiwalay ang pila ng lalaki't babae. so hayun.   5:00-ish  nagsimula nang papasukin ang mga babae. karen got in and was whisked backstage by concert staff for the m&g. isa sya sa sampung maswerteng tao; sa sampung 'yon dalawa silang LP underground members.  maya-mayang konti, inubos na yung mga natitirang babae atsaka sinimulan nang papasukin lahat ng lalaki. biglang sabi ng bouncer  'dun sa kabila ang gold at silver!'  -- he was referring to another side entrance na may kalayuan sa pinagpilahan ko.   SPRINT!  tagaktak ang pawis ko dahil sa sprint, so binanatan ko na yung baon naming mineral water. bawal pala sa loob, ha... dein naman sinita ng marshall e.  pagdating dun, may babaeng naghuhuramentado dahil 2PM pa daw sya nakapila, tapos bigla na lang patatakbuhin kami sa iba palang entrance. tsss. buti na lang maluwag pa sa gold area, kaya nakapasok ako kaagad.  pwesto ako sa malapit sa guardrail. there are about fifty people inside the gold front area. the stage is about 15-20 feet away. LP's gear are covered in large tarps. the PA is blasting house music and promotional ads.  hintay. mahigit dalawang oras pa bago magsimula. by this time, i'm starting to get hungry, but i don't eat kasi gusto ko sabay kami ni karen.   6:30-ish  nasa air-conditioned backstage tent na si karen kasama ang iba pang m&g-ers.  dumarami na ang tao sa gold front area. hintay pa rin. mainit, di gumagalaw ang hangin. medyo gutom na. nag-se-setup ang crew ng LP.  good thing they thought of putting sand on the grassy field -- that's to prevent the ground from getting muddy in case it rains.  hintay.   7:15PM  karen finishes her m&g with LP. she calls me on the phone to ask where i am, so i raise my hand and tell her, 'look for my hand, i'm waving'. and a guy i guess overhears me, and offers me his red fred durst baseball cap for me to wave. so sige, i tell karen 'i'm waving a red cap!' turns out, napunta sya sa gold VIP area, which was cordoned off by guardrails from the gold front area, where i was. so karen had to double back around the whole field to get to our area.  when she gets there, i have to relinquish my prime spot 'cos she's daunted by the thought of squeezing through the sweaty throng. oks lang, hirap nga naman doon, baka madurog pa kami.  bili kami kaagad ng dalawang PhP50 hotdog sandwich atsaka dalawang PhP25  maliit  na mineral water. ah sustenance at last. dinner na namin 'yon. then she shows me the pix of the LP guys she took with her P800. astig! nakalusot yung P800 nya! when i get 'em, post ko dito ;)  madilim na -- there are occasional gusts of wind that cool us, but it's still humid as hell. pawis na pawis na ako.  hintay pa. at least kasama ko na sya.   8:20PM - it's showtime!  after an hour of waiting and some hysterical screaming by fans, the huge  [LINKIN PARK] -emblazoned backdrop is hoisted up on stage. more hysterical screaming.  no sponsor roll-call, no front act. it's LP all the way to 9:45PM! awesome show! they played songs from both Hybrid Theory and Meteora, plus one unreleased song, and a Nine Inch Nails cover.  gainto setup nila sa stage: sa likod, si mr. hahn (with the big DJ setup) tsaka yung drummer nila, nasa mataas na riser. sa harap, si mike shinoda, chester bennington, and the guitarist and the bassist. no amps, just monitors. may apat na maliit na vanity stage na pwede nila sampahan. astig! tapos parang halos bawat kanta, yung guitarist nagpapalit ng gitara. yung bassist, nagtataka ako, ganun din pero same type lang ng bass, iba lang kulay. pero may 5-string tsaka 4-string pala sya, kaya sya nagpapalit.  buti na lang hindi umulan. BUTI NA LANG! eto na muna about the LP concert, ang dami na kasi nito e. post ako about LP over the next few days.  >>>   As promised, my Mandy Moore article from Balitang Higad   Yours truly got the chance to watch teen songstress  Mandy Moore &rsquo;s concert at the  Araneta Coliseum  last month. Those of you who are members of the official itchyworms! mailing list may have read my long semi-rant about the event, posted 21 November 2003. In it, I tried to give an objective &ldquo;review&rdquo; of the show, but I think I failed miserably because the show had almost no saving grace. To read the whole message [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/itchyworms/message/4977], join our mailing list. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Although I am not a fan of Ms. Moore, I  am  a fan of great music. Her new album dubbed  Coverage  intrigued me. It contains covers-slash-remakes of popular songs such as  Carole King &rsquo;s  I Feel the Earth Move  and  Todd Rundgren &rsquo;s  Can We Still Be Friends , hence the obvious title.&nbsp; So I said to myself, what the hey, give it a shot, you might have a good time. After all, my girlfriend is a fan So I went to the Big Dome not expecting much.  Also, it&rsquo;s not often that I get to watch a popular foreign act in Manila. The first and only foreign artist I&rsquo;ve seen live here in Manila is  Sting . My girlfriend and I watched his  Mercury Falling  promotional concert at the Ultra (circa 1998). In my youth I was deprived of the chance(s) to watch  Pearl Jam ,  Rage Against the Machine  and  Metallica  when they brought their world tours to Manila in the mid-1990&rsquo;s, so I guess I&rsquo;m trying to make up for it. But I digress.  As I was expecting, Mandy Moore&rsquo;s first concert outside of her native United States started late. The show was supposed to start at 8:30 PM. After a one-hour wait, the major sponsor&rsquo;s fashion presentation, the front acts Fil-Am R&amp;B singer  Jay-R  and former  14-K  member  Arnee  (of  Cold Summer Nights  remake fame) and another 30-minute wait, concert proper was finally ready to begin.  Mandy&rsquo;s voice was top-notch, and her band were quite tight. They pounded out the songs like a well-oiled machine, never missing a note. Now that I look back (again) I think the band&rsquo;s performance had all the finesse of a machine, too. The house sound system sounded weak and the mix was rather unprofessional, as microphones kept feeding back. Mandy&rsquo;s voice would also be drowned out by the band from time to time. And the crowd&rsquo;s din would at times drown out the whole sound reinforcement setup. The house speakers just weren&rsquo;t enough for the big venue.  All in all, Mandy&rsquo;s whole set consisted of just ten songs. Yes, including the encore  Cry . Mandy&rsquo;s voice was hoarse by the time she sang her encore, and she was noticeably straining to hit the song&rsquo;s high notes. I don&rsquo;t think we can blame her for having a bum throat that night. Who knows? Maybe the climate didn&rsquo;t suit her well. All this being said, I think Mandy Moore has an excellent singing voice, and is no doubt one of the better female singers on rotation in MTV.  Still, I&rsquo;m hoping to have a better concert experience with  Incubus  and  Toto  in 2004.  errata dito: i watched the Sting  Mercury Falling  concert in  1996 ,  not  in 1998. (salamat kay  urlLink Mike )  >>>  woohoo! may  urlLink GMail  account na ako! maraming salamat kay karenlog na nag-invite sa akin sa GMail. 1 GIGABYTE, BAYBEEEE!  sa Yahoo! naman, nag-upgrade na sila ng free email nila to 100MB. Pero wala pa rin ako nung upgrade kahit noong 2000 pa ako nag-sign-up. oist! Yahoo! loyal user ako ha!

       urlLink Palace Mulls 20% Tax for Every Text Message (from inq7.net) . that's a big load of bullshit if you ask me. we're already suffering some form of fascist rule with PLDT's monopoly on telephony (and that of Meralco's on electricity). we shouldn't have to suffer yet  another  tax on our alternatives to PLDT. Globe and Sun are the Davids to PLDT's goliath -- i don't count Smart because it's PLDT-owned.  mobile phone GSM service providers like Globe, when they came out, were a godsend to the telephone-deprived. finally cheaper -- and therefore more accessible -- communication was possible. we had been denied of telephones for so long by PLDT (even now, applying for one is a bitch) that a reliable alternative, like Globe's pioneering insanely cheap text messaging, was bound to succeed. and now they want to TAX us for using it?!  gusto ko silang yakapin at alagaan dahil dito:   excerpt   "It is an inherent right of the state to impose taxes," said a high-ranking finance official, adding that text messaging had characteristics that made it "excisable," or liable for excise tax...  The finance official said too much texting, especially of jokes, made the activity go beyond being a necessity. As such, this made texting liable for excise tax, which is an impost on such items as alcohol, cigarette, luxury vehicles, and jewelry.  "We have a reason to tax texting because too much of it clogs the system and it encroaches on what are supposed to be productive working hours," the finance official said.    in fairness to PLDT, they said this:  Telecom giant Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT) said imposing a tax on text messaging would be detrimental to the telecommunication industry, which is a significant contributor to the country's economic growth.  but one expects them to say this because they're also a player in the huge, extremely lucrative text-messaging market.  here's an idea: the government should shape up its tax collection procedures, not introduce new 'hidden' or 'forced-payment' taxes like VAT. maybe, just maybe, if the taxes we unwillingly (unwittingly?) pay were used to actually improve on basic services and other appropriate things, i (for one) wouldn't be opposed to it. but no, there's just too many corrupt pigs in barongs pocketing too much of our hard-earned manuel roxases.  WAG NA YUNG TEXT-TAX. PLIS LANG.   >>>  karen, my lucky girlfriend, just got chosen to meet and greet the members of no less than linkin park (LP) when they come to manila to perform on tuesday. despite her being a member of LP's underground, she still had to sign up for the meet-and-greet raffle. we figured, hey, how many filipino LP underground members are there? baka konti lang, naisip namin. dapat dein na yung raffle kung konti lang hehe... anyway, she was still chosen. so on tuesday the 15th, we'll be at the CCP for her 3:45PM meet-and-greet with messrs. hahn, shinoda and bennington, et al. lucky gal. she deserves it, though -- she's a really big fan.  although i'm not a real fan of LP, i'm actually looking forward to tuesday cos they'll be the first foreign act i've seen since mandy moore. and they're the first foreign rock act i will have seen since sting in 1999. i wrote an essay for  Balitang Higad  (our band's dormant newsletter) about ms. moore's concert at the big dome in 2003. i'll post it here later.  >>>  hassle. panibagong gastos.  just as we had big red's wheels changed (smooth ride na), and the air conditioning fixed (cool ride pa), a rotten branch fell from one of our trees here at home fell on it. so now there's a spiderweb of cracks on big red's windshield. we should have seen it coming cos a few weeks back, a much larger branch fell off the same tree. lucky echo and i were using big red when it happened. luckily, the branch that fell this time was much smaller. luckily, the crack isn't on the driver's side, so driving won't be too difficult. jazz says that it's a sign that we should sell big red. but part of me doesn't want to cos i learned to drive in this city with that car. and i really don't wanna be without a vehicle now. well, we made do without one for years... oh well. wait-and-see muna. right now, i'm just thankful that i have my own transportation. :)

      yesterday, i took the MRT from shaw boulevard to santolan/annapolis. at rush hour. oo, saksakan ng siksikan. can you say 'sardines'? just after the train left ortigas, a man and a woman started arguing. when the rare argument erupts in the MRT, practically  everyone  listens.  apparently, yung lalaki, may dalang envelope-type bag/pouch and he was holding on to it with the hand he was using to hold on to the railing as well. dahil siksikan nga, he had to hold on to the high horizontal railing, not the vertical ones. because he was using only one hand to hold on to both the railing and his envelope, nahulog yung envelope for what i surmise wasn't the first time. kawawang ale, nahulugan (nang baka makailang ulit na) nung envelope na mukhang mabigat.   excerpt   babae: (masungit na) parang nananadya ka yata! lalaki: sinong nananadya? babae: (referring to the envelope thingy) bakit mo hinahawakan 'yan d'yan sa taas?! nahuhulugan na ako eh! lalaki: siyempre mahuhulog galing sa taas! saan ka nakakita ng nahuhulog galing sa bab&acirc;?   at this point, people start snickering. and i'm like  whaaaaat?  alam ko, masama ako for snickering along with them. but the remark from the guy wasn't really funny -- may pagka-pilosopo nga e. naging nakakatawa kasi kalbo yung lalaki, tapos nakaluwa pa yung mata. ka-balor nya si pugak. pramis. hahaha, which reminds me, may isa pa akong riot na pugak story -- si jazz, ako tsaka si echo naman ang mga tauhan -- abangan sa susunod na entry ;)  you could really feel for the woman, though, who just wanted to get home, tapos napeperwisyo pa sya nung lalaki, who was being a real joker about it. palagay ko alam nung lalaki na wala sya sa tama, so he tried to weasel himself out of it by calling the woman  maarte , and telling her  manahimik ka na . sa akin naman,  wag mo kaya hawakan d'yan sa taas?!  have some common sense, fer pete's sake.  >>>  big red is renewed! nakabili na si echo ng bagong gulong kahapon -- may promo sa CATS Greenhills. libreng wheel balancing along with installation. thanks to my dad :) (hey, malapit na nga pala ang father's day). greet your dads!  speaking of my dad, his latest obsession is -- guess what --  Harry Potter . you know he likes something on HBO when he asks you to record it for him. ganun din sya with  Band of Brothers  dati. isip ko nga bilhan sya ng dibidi (hindi DVD, mejo may kamahalan 'yon) ng unang dalawang HP movies (pati na rin yung bago kung meron) for father's day. para magpakasawa sya kay Harry Potter. sana matuwa sya.

      took a taxicab to the MRT this morning. i had the driver take v. luna then east avenue to get to the GMA/Kamuning station. along v. luna near east avenue, there are a lot of street vendors selling broadsheets and cigarettes and candy and whatnot. and there was this guy in an isuzu trooper who stopped in the middle of the road to buy a newspaper, so he somewhat obstructed traffic. naisip ko,  hus, porke malaki sasakyan mo basta ka na lang titigil sa gitna?! yabang nito . well, he really only stopped for a few seconds as another driver was manoeuvering onto v. luna from his parking slot, blocking mr. trooper's path. but still. doesn't that reek selfishness and inconsiderate-ness (if there's such a word)?  this morning's incident reminded me of another example of pinoy  kayabangan  that i happened upon recently. i was on my way to jazz's house for practice, so i was on the kalentong jeep on shaw boulevard. and there was this guy in the front passenger row who was arguing with the driver and the driver's wife. apparently, he had taken the seat when driver and wife had waved him away to the passenger seats at back, like everyone else. now, it peeves me too when i want to ride up front but am forced to sit somewhere else, but this guy was different. all the way to JRU, they were arguing.  when the guy got off, he gave the driver an angry tirade. and si mamang driver wasn't at all fazed, he just shot back at the guy's harangue. at this point, i'm thinking, (sarcastically)  oh please, just shut the hell up and go home cos this is really awkward, not to mention inconvenient .  as the driver speeds off, the angry guy pulls a fucking .45 pistol and aims it at the driver! he was shouting  HOY! BUMALIK KA RITO!  na parang action star sa isang pelikula. syempre, kaming mga pasahero, andun kami sa likod. and i swear, my life flashed before my eyes. i thought,  oh shit, what if he's a bad shot and he misses the driver but hits me?! . without overstatement, i can say that that was one of the scariest things to happen to me in my whole life. in retrospect, nakikita ko na ang  yabang  nung mamang yon. nagkabaril lang sya, he thought he had the right to pull it on the driver (and everyone else in the jeep for that matter).  a friend of my dad also turned loopy when he carried his gun around. my dad tells me the guy pistol-whipped someone for cutting him on the road. fist fight, ok, but pistol-whip? man. also he kept dropping  barilin kita d'yan eh  to people he was annoyed with. tssss. even my dad avoided him. happy will be the day when turds like these are denied their permits-to-carry.  >>>  in other news, ayos na yung cooling system problem ni big red. turns out the water pump had already died, and kept on bleeding coolant. so we hadda buy a new water pump. langya mas mahal pa yung labor kesa sa piyesa. jeez. i think we'll be getting new tires this weekend, too. woohoo!

      i miss karen :s she's in baguio on retreat, so i'll be alone at french class later today. poor thing hasn't had a decent night's sleep since she got there this past saturday. typhoon frank was particularly belligerent in baguio, as karen says the winds kept banging the windows at their retreat house. and that's not counting the LOUD snoring from her roomie. i should know, i  heard  it last night when karen and i were talking on the mobile. hope the typhoon lets up soon so she can get a good night's sleep. her first day of class is on wednesday, and she can't afford to lack sleep.  >>>  admit one on saturday was a blast. the theme was old-school OPM, so nag-cover kami ng  No Touch  ng Juan de la Cruz band. saya! with all due respect to mike hanopol, i have to say his vocal performance on that song is appropriately manyakis-sounding.   pahipo naman (no touch) pahawak naman (no touch) di na kita (no touch) matsansingan   sabihin nyong hindi manyakis 'yang mga lyrics na 'yan.  >>>  hey, can someone tell me about how to duplicate my blogger entries on my LJ or vice versa? it's a bitch to always have to copy-paste my entries every time i update. thankies!

      in my wallet, in the part where you're s'posed to store credit cards and whatnot, i store the  urlLink MRT  stored-value pass upside-down. why, you ask? it's because GMA's frigging face is on there. ayoko ngang mapagkamalang Ate Glo supporter. come to think of it, i have an unused Erap-edition single-journey MRT pass (the green one). itapon ko na kaya? then again, it might be worth something someday.  if her photo on all those cards isn't electioneering, i don't know what is. she had her face on them  way  before election 2004's sanctioned campaign period even began. paging  urlLink comelec , chairman abalos! huuuy!  granted, the MRT is a godsend to those who traverse EDSA on their daily commute to work. hindi naman project ni Ate Glo yun eh. the contracts for that project were signed when FVR was president, so for all intents and purposes, it's Eddie "Tabako" Ramos who should have his mug on all those cards.  >>>  bought gold area (yeah, baby!) tickets to  urlLink Linkin Park 's Meteora world tour Manila installment. hope it doesn't rain on the 15th or we're f**ked.

      flight status: normal inflight entertainment:  Bogchi Hokbu  from the  Eraserheads Anthology      i didn't get to go around cebu city much, but i was able to eat a lot -- and i mean a  lot  -- of great food. when we got to cebu, we checked in at the Marriott and went straight to the breakfast buffet. there, i had some toast and cheese with strawberry jam, plus a hotcake, scrambled eggs, bacon, and some fruit and orange juice.  i love hotel breakfast buffets! yum!  after our morning event at Southwestern U, we had lunch with the members of the  urlLink POGS  cebu chapter, where we had the classic cebu lechon (no mang tomas for me, thanks), kalderetang kambing, roast calf and fish fillet. double yum! after packing up , we headed straight back to the Marriott to get some shot-eye.  at 6pm, we woke up to -- guess what -- have dinner! we had dinner at grand cowrie where we feasted on crispy pata, chicharon bulaklak, laing, pinakbet, sizzling boneless bangus, halaan, baked scallops and unlimited rice! for dessert i had bud-bud (suman with chocolate sauce) and all that food for nine people cost just PhP2600.   *BURP*   at the hotel i looked at my self in the mirror and my tummy was bulging. ugh. :|   the PAL in-flight snack packs were the same going to and coming from cebu: crackers, a fudge pastry, peanuts and Storck. :P on the flight back to manila, i hadn't had any breakfast so i finished everything off except the Storck.   the plane going to cebu was a Boeing 737-400 while the plane back was an Airbus A300, same as what  urlLink we  rode to cebu 2002 for our SM mall tour. the A300's seats are on the stiff side, and the air conditioning is a bit warm. the 737 meanwhile has comfier seats, is quieter, and has cooler air conditioning.

       A. Lipin  28 July 2004 (by Jess Abrera, from inq7.net)    this strip goes particularly well with conrad de quiros's column  urlLink Sex, Lies and Washington , and together they pretty much sum up how i feel about the whole iraq pullout fiasco.

         karen had her hair cut last friday. she had an oh-so-cute pixie-style cut done cos her long hair was cramping her style. the new style suits her well and i have a big crush on her now *grin*   coming to work earlier than usual is like seeing the beginning of a movie for the first time after you've started it in the middle and watched it through to the end.  so  thaaaat's  what happens!  coding si big red ngayon, so i opted to beat the 7am number-coding cutoff in lieu of enduring what might be a less-than-dry commute via public transport. i was actually still on the street at 7am, but suprisingly few traffic enforcers were at their posts. i saw one of them along greenmeadows in front of valle 5 but he was just walking along the sidewalk, not, well, enforcing traffic. ako naman si kabado, akala ko titingnan nya yung plaka ko kaya todo iwas-tingin ako sa kanya. buti na lang mukhang kakain muna sya ng agahan. :|    The Bourne Supremacy , sequel to  The Bourne Identity  is coming out soon. i liked the  Identity  but, having read Robert Ludlum's novel first, i was disappointed with all the creative liberties the makers took especially with the plot. glaringly gone was the subplot tying protagonist Jason Bourne to the &uuml;ber-assassin known only as Carlos. maybe it was all the scriptwriters could do to glean an easily-digestible (read: Hollywood-ized) plot from Ludlum's layered manuscript. note to self: read  Supremacy   after  seeing the movie.   a month or two ago, we consigned the songs from our  and the worm jumped over the moon  single to a cellular service company for public subscription on their ringtunes service. on the menu were the two versions of  buwan  and  illusions , a live recording of the early itchyworms song at a 1997 itchyworms gig. in may, we received the numbers from the company. in the first month of the deal (march), subscriptions were relatively few, limited to about twenty each for  buwan  and  illusions  and roughly double that for the acoustic  buwan . in the second month (april), subscriptions shot up dramatically.  buwan  acoustic got about eighty,  buwan  original ninety. and get this:  illusions  got 611 subscriptions for the month of april alone. that number beats the crap out of  over the moon 's gross sales! who would've thought that subscriber ringtunes could be an alternative channel for song distribution? how about that?  that being said, check out  urlLink itchyworms.com  for details about  My Jolly Old Buddy  (previously available on the Last Full Show compilation), our new ringtune on Smart.   yesterday, sales reps from  urlLink Honda  were at the office campus showing off their new 1.3-liter hatchback, the Jazz. think Honda City but as a wagon instead of a sedan. after lunch, i went over to the parking lot to take a look at the shiny new electric blue vehicle. i got into the driver's seat and started inspecting the dashboard and the seats. it was quite roomy for a car its size. when suddenly,  sir, sa banda po ba kayo? di ba kayo yung sa antipara?  turns out both of the sales reps, a guy named stef and a girl named mafeth (she pronounces if muffet), knew me from my band's video. that broke the ice a bit, so i asked if i could possibly start the engine and maybe take a test drive around campus. they said yes and hopped in. it was a fun 3-minute drive around the parking lot. i dug you could switch to a 7-speed semi-manual transmission from the default automatic. what's neat about the 7-speed tranny is you switch gears with buttons on the steering wheel, much like F1 trannies. i'd buy that zippy little car if i had the money! fun fun fun!

         a while back i was obsessing over the overall design of  urlLink itchyworms.com . either i'm getting tired of the design or it's too cluttered : somebody please restrain me from getting all obsessive-compulsive over this.    at last saturday's LFS, i stayed to watch  Quail Quartet . just as with the now-defunct  Fish Trio , nainggit ako. they revived my desire to form a jazz band. thing is, i'm not confident that my guitar chops will suffice for playing jazz.  urlLink jal !!! 'stumomagjazz?    today marks the start of a two-week repreive from our language classes at  urlLink Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise . i'll miss the lessons but it'll be good to have mondays and wednesdays a little less hectic. up next: module 3!   *blip*

         with big red in Quezon for repairs, i'm riding jeepneys more frequently. and i've noticed that with the recent fare increase (minimim of PhP5.50), the lowly 25-centavo coin is ubiquitously back in circulation. matanda na ako kasi naaalala ko pa na we had 1&cent; (square with rounded corners), 50&cent; (with the monkey-eating eagle) and P2 coins (decagonal and, more recently, rounded, with the coconut palm), some of which were part of the  Flora and Fauna  series of the  urlLink Republic Period  of philippine currency. currency factoid: the study of coins is called  Numismatics . cool!    ahm, sir, baka meron po silang smaller bill?   speaking of money, i just found out that the philippines has the Guinness-certified biggest paper bill in the world?    centennial note image mulled from the  urlLink bangko sentral money museum website   the PhP100,000 centennial bank note measures a whopping 8&frac12; x 14 inches. langya, sinlaki ng long bond paper! let's see if you can get THAT into your wallet.  urlLink maysh ! may barya ka sa isandaang libo? hati tayo!  kadiri, i'm blogging about money. buti na lang sweldo na bukas :|

        just got the 100MB Yahoo! Mail upgrade. langya, kailangan lang pala punuin yung Inbox. fmeh.   i missed Six Feet Under on tuesday because of the FOPC gig. will miss the replay on friday because we're rehearsing for saturday's Eraserheads tribute gig and we have the LFS gig that night.   karen and i celebrated our anniversary yesterday. she gave me Robert Ludlum's  The Cassandra Compact , knowing that i used to read him before. yay! new bedtime read for me! i bought us dinner at caf&eacute; juanita in kapitolyo. kinda pricey but the food and ambience were perfect. my karen absolutely adored the cr&eacute;me brul&eacute;e we had for dessert :D she said, "now i understand all the fuss about cr&eacute;me brul&eacute;e." i love my girlfriend *sigh*   dad and i rode the MRT together this morning. first time namin magkasama! we were both southbound: he was on his way to makati, and i on my way to work. i enjoyed dad's company cos i hadn't seen him since sunday, what with my schedule and all. aside from my dad asking me about work, we didn't talk much on the cab ride over to GMA-Kamuning nor on the MRT. but i guess that's the way it is between men, and maybe even moreso between fathers and sons. certain things needn't be said.   on my way home the day before yesterday, i took the UP Campus - Pantranco jeep from near the Quezon Avenue MRT station. i got off at the National Housing Authority (NHA) building on the Elliptical Road. and i remembered that my dad, being an architect by trade, used to work for the NHA. in retrospect, it's funny that i remembered this only on that day when i've gotten off there scores of times.  when i was younger, he would tell me stories about his exploits during his tenure there. he would tell of how his colleagues would help themselves to easy money (read: perang kurakot) just by signing cash vouchers at their office. he would say that he could have done the same, but he just didn't have the stomach for stealing other people's money. this got me wondering: if my dad had given in -- compromised his principles -- and taken advantage of the situation, would my family be better-off today financially?  i'm not very religious nor spiritual, but i believe in a sort of karma. what goes around comes around. garbage in, garbage out. if you deal people shit, you'll get shit back. as if to drive his point home, dad would tell about how certain colleagues' (who had given in to avarice and greed) wives or daughters or sons would fall victim to a life-threatening disease or a debilitating accident.  i guess what goes around comes around. would be better off financially? you betcha. but at what cost?

      my girlfriend karen has a crush on Spider-Man. she confessed this fact to me just a while ago, after we got home from watching spidey 2. "kinikilig ako when i see him swinging through the air kahit alam ko na CG lang s'ya. he's like a ballet dancer/gymnast/martial artist. so graceful." or something to that effect :T  i have my work cut out for me. anybody know where i can find some radioactive arachnids? i need to get bit :P

      the great marlon brando passed away yesterday. maybe the Big Mafia Boss Himself made him an offer he couldn't refuse.  >>>  i'm tripping out on the  Eraserheads Anthology  (i've been hankering for this double-CD ever since  urlLink kathyg  raved about it). listening to the songs, i realize that it's mindblowing to actually be  peers  and  friends  with the very people who wrote the songs that were the soundtrack of my youth.  sabihin n'yo nang baduy ako pero ang galing lang talaga ng songs nila, lalo na yung  Para Sa Masa  -- nakakaiyak. i'll take their  cover  remake of Ryan Cayabyab's  Tuwing Umuulan at Kapiling Ka  over Regine's screecher any day of the week and twice on Sunday. and who can deny the understated but groundbreaking sublimeness of  Ligaya, Toyang  and  Pare Ko ? those songs may have literally sealed the musical fates of many of the players in today's local scene.  the question is, are they earning any royalties off this release? they'd better be. it'd be a crying shame if they weren't. they certainly deserve the compensation.  >>>  yes, i am materialistic. what of it? etong mga gusto ko:  gadgets and other stuff: - digital camera - scanner - bagong PC - iPod 20GB - yung alangyang 6610i - Marshall na amp - hardcase para sa HS Anderson ko - patch cables atsaka matinong 9V power adapter para sa Boss pedals ko  DVDs: - Lord of the Rings: Return of the King - The Matrix Revolutions - Fight Club - Godfather Trilogy - Back to the Future Trilogy - 24 Season 3 - Six Feet Under Seasons 1 &amp; 2 - Beatles Anthology - G3 Live  CDs: - Velvet Revolver - Outkast,  Speakerboxxx/The Love Below  (come to think of it, meron pala si kelvin nito. burn ko na lang siguro :P) - Steve Vai Anthology - Steve Vai,  Fire Garden ,  Passion and Warfare , atbp. - Joe Satriani,  Is There Love In Space? , atbp.  so much stuff, so little money.

      i don't know if it's my quarter-life crisis kicking in, but i often find myself wanting to turn back time whenever something bad happens. and the desire to do so always -- for lack of a better word -- rhetorical. i mean i  really  want to turn back time and undo all the deeds and misdeeds and not just leave the yearning alone.  i wish i were Marty McFly (not the band) in  urlLink  Back to the Future  . [For those of you who haven't seen it or were too young when they first saw it, go  urlLink here .] i wish i had a Dr. Emmett Brown who had invented a time machine (in a DeLorean, at that), who would have me go back in time to undo all the events that had gone wrong. i wish i could help  my  parents banish all the demons in  their  past(s) in order to improve their lives and, ultimately, our family's life.  alas, there's no turning back time. all one can do is take stock of the past in order to deal with, and make the most of, the present and hope that the future holds better things.  note to self: get the  Back to the Future  DVD box set.
