       urlLink Affordances and Design ( jnd.org ) : "The word 'affordance' was originally invented by the perceptual psychologist J. J. Gibson (1977, 1979) to refer to the actionable properties between the world and an actor (a person or animal). To Gibson, affordances are a relationship. They are a part of nature: they do not have to be visible, known, or desirable. Some affordances are yet to be discovered. Some are dangerous. I suspect that none of us know all the affordances of even everyday objects."

      Nearly 80 percent of UK central government Web sites need to be redesigned before they can be fully accessible to users with disabilities, a report has found.     Did you know you can get the e-Government Digest sent direct to your inbox every week? Just email us to get your free copy.   A UK publication called eGov Monitor Weekly has reported that around 800 public sector Web sites may need rebuilding to comply with accessibility laws requiring government services to cater for people with disabilities.   The claim is based on details leaked from an internal report carried out by the Office of the e-Envoy (OeE), the cabinet office unit responsible among other things for improving the accessibility and usability of UK government Web sites.   The OeE report draws upon the findings by the National Audit Office investigation, which examined the accessibility of 65 central government Web sites and concluded that nearly all were potentially excluding users.   EGov Monitor estimates that to fix the problems, government departments may need to spend at least 10 percent to 15 percent of their total annual budget for Web sites. Editor Ian Cuddy told ElectricNews.Net that it was difficult to put a precise figure on the total cost of the redesigns required because the OeE has refused to release further details of the audit, but it is expected to run into millions.   The OeE has now warned the Web design industry that future government contracts will demand that companies deliver Web sites that conform to international Web accessibility standards. Current responsibility for adopting these standards rests with individual government webmasters, not designers, and compliance is not centrally monitored.    urlLink ElectricNews.net:News:UK must redesign e-gov sites: report

COSTELLO: No, the name's Lou.   ABBOTT: Your computer?   COSTELLO: I don't own a computer. I want to buy one.   ABBOTT: Mac?   COSTELLO: I told you, my name's Lou.   ABBOTT: What about Windows?   COSTELLO: Why? Will it get stuffy in here?   ABBOTT: Do you want a computer with windows?   COSTELLO: I don't know. What will I see when I look in the windows?   ABBOTT: Wallpaper.   COSTELLO: Never mind the windows. I need a computer and software.   ABBOTT: Software for windows?   COSTELLO: No. On the computer! I need something I can use to write proposals track expenses and run my business. What have you got?   ABBOTT: Office.   COSTELLO: Yeah, for my office. Can you recommend anything?   ABBOTT: I just did.   COSTELLO: You just did what?   ABBOTT: Recommend something.   COSTELLO: You recommended something?   ABBOTT: Yes.   COSTELLO: For my office?   ABBOTT: Yes   COSTELLO: OK, what did you recommend for my office?   ABBOTT: Office.   COSTELLO: Yes, for my office!   ABBOTT: I recommend office with windows.   COSTELLO: I already have an office and it has windows! OK, let's just say, I m sitting at my computer and I want to type a proposal. What do I need?   ABBOTT: Word.   COSTELLO: What word?   ABBOTT: Word in office.   COSTELLO: The only word in office is office.   ABBOTT: The word in office for windows.   COSTELLO: Which word in office for windows?   ABBOTT: The word you get when you click the blue "w."   COSTELLO: I'm going to click your blue w if you don't start with some straight answers. OK, forget that. Can I watch movies on the Internet?   ABBOTT: Yes, you want Real One.   COSTELLO: Maybe a real one, maybe a cartoon. What I watch is none of your business. Just tell me what I need!   ABBOTT: Real One.   COSTELLO: If it's a long movie I also want to see reel 2, 3 & 4. Can I watch them?   ABBOTT: of course.   COSTELLO: Great, with what?   ABBOTT: Real One.

COSTELLO: Is that different from the blue "w"?   ABBOTT: The blue 1 is Real One and the blue "w" is Word.   COSTELLO: What word?   ABBOTT: The Word in Office for Windows.   COSTELLO: But there's three words in office for windows!   ABBOTT: No, just one. But it's the most popular Word in the world.   COSTELLO: It is?   ABBOTT: Yes, but to be fair, there aren't many other words left. It pretty much wiped out all the other words out there.   COSTELLO: And that word is real one?   ABBOTT: Real One has nothing to do with Word. Real One isn't even part of Office.   COSTELLO: Stop! Don't start that again. What about financial bookkeeping, do you have anything I can track my money with?   ABBOTT: Money.   COSTELLO: That's right. What do you have?   ABBOTT: Money.   COSTELLO: I need money to track my money?   ABBOTT: It comes bundled with your computer.   COSTELLO: What's bundled to my computer?   ABBOTT: Money   COSTELLO: Money comes with my computer?   ABBOTT: Yes. No extra charge.   COSTELLO: I get a bundle of money with my computer? How much?   ABBOTT: One copy   COSTELLO: Isn't it illegal to copy money?   ABBOTT: Microsoft gave us a license to copy Money.   COSTELLO: They can give you a license to copy money?   ABBOTT: Why not, they own it.

       urlLink BBC article:    Opening hours row at cottage: The cottage was opened as a museum in 1924. A heritage group in Stafford say they are angry at plans to cut the opening hours of one of the town's most historic landmarks despite their offers of help. The borough council says Izaak Walton's Cottage, in Shallowford, is proving expensive to run. The former home of Izaak Walton, the author of 1653 fishing book The Complete Angler, houses a collection dedicated to his life and angling. A report to councillors says that limiting access to the museum to weekends from May to August would save £17,000. Currently the attraction is open on weekday afternoons from April to October. 'Few opportunities' But the Izaak Walton Cottage Chapter, who have set up a charitable trust to fund the running of the cottage, said they were upset the council had not met them before making the decision. Tony Bridgett, president of the chapter, said: "The council threatened to close the cottage 18 months ago and there was a campaign run by the people of Stafford and ourselves to keep it open. "So in some respects we are delighted that it is staying open. "But it is only going to open from May to the end of August, and only on Saturdays and Sundays and not bank holidays so members of the public are going to get very few opportunities to visit. "We have some money available and the council say they haven't got any but they haven't got round to meeting us so we are able to mutually work together." Members of the council's leisure scrutiny committee will debate the plans next week. A spokeswoman for the council said the hours had been revised to take into account when visitors most used the cottage. She said a range of events will continue to be held at the cottage and coach trips, including schools, would still be able to visit during the week.

      SpaceShipOne, the first private manned spacecraft, is undergoing final preparations before its historic flight to the edge of space on Monday. The craft, built by aviation pioneer Burt Rutan, will be launched into the sky by its carrier, White Knight, then rocket upwards to 100km (62 miles).  No private craft has ever been so high. In May, it reached 64km (40 miles) in a test flight, doubling its last best. The attempt over California's Mojave Desert is due to launch at 1330 GMT. Mr Rutan and his team from his company, Scaled Composites, hope the flight will take them closer to winning the Ansari X-prize of $10m (£5.7m) awarded to the first non-government, manned flight into space.   urlLink ...more

       urlLink Google, Yahoo face off in suit   Google is the darling of the Internet and seemingly at the top of its game as it charges toward a public stock offering sometime this summer.  But the Mountain View company could be paying hundreds of millions of dollars to its Sunnyvale archrival, Yahoo, if it loses a little-noticed patent lawsuit unfolding in a San Jose courtroom.  The case pits Google against Overture Services, an Internet advertising company bought by Yahoo last year. Overture claims it patented an online bidding system for ads seven months before Google introduced a similar system.  Patent attorneys who have reviewed the suit said Overture's patent claims can't be easily dismissed.  ``I think there is merit based on the breadth of the claims,'' said Dave Ashby, a patent attorney with the IP Strategy Group in Cupertino. ``I took a look at it and said, `Yep, Google does that. Yep, Google does that.' ''  A key ruling in the 2-year-old case -- which could determine whether the two sides settle or forge ahead to a jury trial -- is expected at any time, say patent attorneys who have reviewed the suit.  Advertising made up about 95 percent of Google's $1 billion in revenue last year. If the company loses the patent suit, it would probably have to pay damages, license technology from Yahoo or alter how it manages its ad system.  Overture, then known as GoTo.com, filed its patent in May 1999 for a ``system and method for influencing a position on a search result list.'' The 43-page patent application details a system in which advertisers would be able to bid for better placement of ads in search-engine results and manage their accounts through a Web browser.  The U.S. Patent Office awarded the patent July 31, 2001.  In February 2002, Google introduced its AdWords program -- a system that would eventually help reshape Internet advertising and legitimize search engines as a viable business. With AdWords, advertisers bid for the right to certain keywords. When a Google user types in that keyword as part of a search, the advertiser's pitch shows up near the results.  A tour operator in Hawaii, for example, might buy the terms ``Hawaii,'' ``vacation,'' ``volcano'' and ``beach,'' and its ads will appear next to Google search results for those terms. Advertisers bid against one another for keywords, with higher bidders getting better ad placement.  In its suit, filed in April 2002, Overture says Google is ``willfully'' and ``directly infringing'' on its patent. The company is seeking triple damages.  Google, which is in a mandated ``quiet period'' leading up to its IPO, declined to comment on the suit, as did attorneys representing both companies.  But in court documents, the company denies Overture's allegations. Among other things, Google is claiming that Overture was using its advertising system for more than a year before it filed for its patent. Patent law gives people a year to file patents after inventing something; a late filing automatically invalidates the patent.  Patent attorneys who have reviewed court documents have mixed views on Overture's chances of prevailing.  Mitchell Rosenfeld, a patent attorney with Capstone Law Group in San Mateo, said Google has submitted substantial evidence to show that Overture missed the one-year deadline.  Rosenfeld said a key issue in the case could end up being whether Overture was testing its technology or using a finished product.  On the other hand, Overture needs only to prove that Google infringed on one of the 67 claims in its patent. Also, Overture's patent application appears to have been well-researched by both the company and the patent office, said Bruce Sunstein of Bromberg & Sunstein in Boston.  ``This is going to be a patent that is relatively difficult to knock out,'' Sunstein said.  Since late March, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, a former patent attorney, has been analyzing the scope and meaning of Overture's patent, poring over each word and studying terminology such as ``database'' and ``search result list.'' It's a crucial step before a jury can be asked to decide whether a company has infringed on a patent. A ruling could come any day.  Known as ``Markman'' rulings, these decisions are often tipping points in patent cases, said patent attorney John Ferrell, co-founder of Carr & Ferrell in Palo Alto.  If the judge does not agree with one side's interpretation of the patent language, it will often push to settle the suit, he said.  The case is especially intriguing now that Internet search engines have become big business. When the suit was filed two years ago, Overture was suing an up-and-coming search engine with an unproven business model.  Today, Google is considered the king of Internet search. And Overture's stature increased when Yahoo acquired the company for $1.83 billion in stock and cash, incorporating its advertising technology and patents into its services.  ``It's one of those things that two or three years ago wouldn't have been an issue,'' said Andy Beal, vice president of search marketing for WebSourced. ``But it just goes to show you how big search is.''  About half of all patent verdicts are overturned on appeal. And the stakes are high. Ultimately, the two sides will have to weigh the costs of a prolonged legal fight -- attorney bills in a case like this could reach $1 million a year -- against the possibility of losing.  ``My observation is that there is this big lawsuit between two enormous players,'' Ashby said, ``and no one is paying attention to it.''

In a column headlined: "We owe Arabs nothing", Kilroy-Silk wrote: "What do (Arabs) think we feel about them ... that we admire them for being suicide bombers, limb amputators, women repressors?"

       urlLink Times Online - Industry sectors : "MPs press for crackdown on cyber-crime By Ingrid Mansell    MAXIMUM jail terms for computer hackers could be quadrupled to two years in a reform of Britain�s 14-year-old cyber-crime law. The offence would become extradictable, letting police make overseas hackers stand trial in the UK.  An all-party group of MPs looking into computer crime yesterday said that the current six-month sentence for hacking needed increasing to �send a clear signal that society now takes �hacking offences� rather more seriously than in 1990�.    The All-party Parliamentary Internet Group (APIG) also recommended that a new offence be created to target cyber-criminals who try to shut websites. Experts said the new law could be used against the extortion gang that attacked gambling websites, including those run by Blue Square and Capital Sports, in the run-up to Euro 2004. The gang sent the betting sites an e-mail threatening to bring down their websites unless a �20,000 ransom was paid. "
