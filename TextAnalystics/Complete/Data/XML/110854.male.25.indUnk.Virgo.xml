      You should realise that everywhere in London is a complete mystery to me and because of the diversity of the place it's an adventure every time I head in to town.  But even so, it's quite strange stepping out of a tube station in the middle of London, walking about 200 metres up the road, and suddenly feeling like you could be in some small town or village in the middle of Somerset (or somewhere equally not-London).  But that's what I managed to do yesterday as I walked through Highgate.    The reason I was making my way (fairly quickly -- I was late) through that area of North London was because I was going to a preview show of Ade's new play &quot;SUCCESS&quot; at the  urlLink Gatehouse  theatre -- a one man show written and starring the man himself.  I've never been to a small-scale production like that before (and considering there were only about 20 people there it was very small), but enjoyed thoroughly enjoyed myself.  Ade's off up to Edinburgh next week for the Fringe festival and let's hope for another award for him!    Another bonus of the night was that we sorted out who got which room in the house -- I got the middle room I was after!  Hooray!

      For someone new to London (or just visiting as I have in the past) the London Underground is a saviour (despite being hot, crowded and late). Get a travelcard and you can just from one place to another without any problem at all.    But the problem with navigating London via the tube is that it gives a totally skewed impression of the Geography of the place. People get the tube when walking would have taken half the time, if only they knew where they were going. For example, in the past I've gone from Tottenham Court Road to Covent Garden by getting the Northern line to Leicester Square and then changing on to the Picadilly line. Now, that probably took about 25 minutes, but if I'd just walkd I could have done it in 15. Ish.         A couple of weeks ago I bought an A-Z which has put a few things into perspective, but for the most part I'm still stuck on tube-geography. Yesterday I came across a  urlLink handy little web page  which gives a number of tube maps, including a  urlLink geographically correct map of the underground .  Nice to see, but doesn't really give you an impression of how you can get from place to another.    But also included on that page is a PDF of the  urlLink geographical map superimprosed onto a street map ! It shows landmarks, train stations and railway lines, tube stop and lines, all in the correct locations, so now you really can see just how quick it would have been to walk instead of fighting the commute!

      Some people move to London for a job. Others, for a better life, or to be closer to friends and family. So what about me? Why did I decide up head into the big smoke? Well, to be honest, because I was bored. There's only so much sitting around watching TV you can do without going a little stir crazy...     So how did it start? Well, for the last few months I've been unsettled and had been thinking about getting out on my own for a while, but with prices of everything soooo expensive around here, it wasn't really an option. But then I got an email from Laura saying she was moving to London for a job and did anyone want to join her. My reaction? "Why the hell not?". A few weeks later, we met at Clapham Junction along with Ade, and within a few hours (yes, we were that lucky) we'd found somewhere perfect for all of us! All we have to do now if finish wrangling with the agent about the contract and move it! Woo hoo!     I'm kinda doing the commuting thing, but backwards -- I'm happy with my job and see no reason to change it, so every morning I'll be getting the train out of London to Windsor and then repeating but in reverse in the evening. Doing that gives me a slightly quieter day day the chance to experience London in the evenings and weekends. I know plenty of people around and to be honest am looking forward to just being able to go to the pub for a quick drink, or head into the center and go to the Science Museum (where I've not been since I was about 12).     Until recently, I'd actually shunned the idea of moving to London as something that I would never do (I'm not a "big places" person) but for some reason I thought I'd give it a go. I'm young, free and not tied down, so why not experience something a bit different now while I've got the chance? And if I don't like it, well, the contract's only a year...
