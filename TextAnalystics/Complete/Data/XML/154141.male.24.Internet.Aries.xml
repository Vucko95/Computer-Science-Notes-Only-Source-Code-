       urlLink MeFi Swap   So to those of you whom I haven't raved to in person yet, this is MeFi Swap, the MetaFilter Mix CD swapping program.  Once a quarter, after you've signed up, you make up a Mix CD, burn 5 copies, and sent it to 5 people who are assigned to you.  Likewise, different people will send you 5 different mix CDs.  This looks like a great way to expand my musical horizons.  Eli and I are already signed up, why aren't you!?!

       urlLink I Used To Believe   This is an interesting little site; a repository of the stories that adults told us as children that we 'used to believe'.  Cute.

       urlLink NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day    Once the source of casual amusement, now the source of wonderful desktop background images! If you've got any interest in astronomy, the earth, or just space in general, this site will provide several years worth of daily eye candy, with just enough information to keep the die-hard geeks satisfied in their data lust.  Remember to click on the image, as they like to get bigger...

       urlLink Yesterdayland    Ahh, nostalgia...  We've all felt it, and it seems that lately, its coming back into the vogue.  This wonderful site allows you to relive the memories of your favorite toys from years gone by.  Going from the present back into the 60's and beyond, you can relive not only your own youth but that of your siblings and parents as well.   Journey with me, and get a healthy dose of "what the hell was I thinking?!?!"

       urlLink Free Culture    This is an excellent presentation that I'm not even going to pretend that I can sum up.  Frankly, if you care about the public domain, and the over-extension of copyright in any way, you need to listen to this...

            The title pretty much says it all.&nbsp; Not me, but it could be. ^_^  Perhaps its just German wormen?        http://www.mil-millington.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/things.html

      Wow,  this  is a really great look into the world of the average computer user.  I went through this list, able to think of at least one example of each from every day on my job at technical support  If more designers, and technical support analysts were aware of these points, the world would be a better place.

      If you've read any blogs recently, you'll have noticed that there is quite a bit of contention over the issue of widget legitimacy in the Apple world.  A lot of people feel that the authors of Konfabulator should have been given the keys to the Apple castle for their work.   urlLink Daring Fireball  has recently posted a rather well done article on why apple has not really done anything wrong by not buying up Konfabulator as the basis of their new technology "Dashboard".  Read it, and you will get a better picture of what is going on here.  But  urlLink some people  still disagree, so I do what I always do whenever there is a contentious issue on a topic I am passionate about, drudge up an obscure metaphor.  The thing that is most missed in reading the Daring Fireball article is that when you are creating a solution that Apple could create themselves, and doing it in a way that meshes perfectly in the Apple environment, you are treading on unstable ground.  Konfabulator is a solution to a supposed hole in the Mac OS, and like the little Dutch boy, they stuck their finger in it.  Its a good solution for now, it keeps the water in the dyke.  But when the dyke-maker comes around to plug the hole with brick and mortar, the same brick and mortar he used to build the dyke, which is going to be the better solution.  When you plug a hole that looks just like a dyke-makers job to the peasants, people will ask why we need dyke-makers to put these entrepreneurs out of business.  But unfortunately, they don't have access to the dyke's plans; their patches may leak (in Konfabulator's case, quite a bit).  The dyke-makers is going to do the repair right, so that the patch will hold; otherwise, they'd take on the amateur as a dyke-maker as well.  Apple isn't trying to take customers away from Konfabulator, Apple is trying to plug the holes in the Mac OS.  Konfabulator isn't a brick in the wall, it doesn't fit quite right, otherwise Apple would have slathered it over, and called it part of the dyke.  And also, there is the issue with the mixup of terms at the Stevenote.  Unfortunately, it is true that Steve did get the terminology wrong (gadget vs. widget), and forgot to mention the rest of webcore in his keynote (webcore minus java), I can't really blame him for that.  First, while it is a developer conference, Steve is a showman, and as demonstrated elsewhere in the keynote, he doesn't like spitting out streams of three-letter-acronyms, which is basically what webcore is.  Secondly, Steve is a big fan of sexy buzzwords, and widget is a much sexier word than gadget, any day of the week.

       	 		 		 This weekend, ASAPA put on the Animethon festival for the first time.  This eleventh incarnation of the festival was by all accounts a raging success, and coupled with 8 hour shifts at work afterwards, ending at midnight, has left me tired as a dog... 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink ASAPA Logo 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink ihorner .
