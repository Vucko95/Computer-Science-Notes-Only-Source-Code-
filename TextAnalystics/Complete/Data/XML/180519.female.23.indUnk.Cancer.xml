      what a marvelous sequence of events this morning. Okay, maybe only two, but they make me happy.  The first one is:  It's raining!! And it smells so good outside. Walking out of Humanities, it was sprinkling a little, when I came out Exclusive it was pouring!! So I'm soaked and happy because I love rain!!!  The other: I finally found a recording of Love for Three Oranges!!! Hurray...I knew I was destined to do something great today, and this will be it, just listening to my favorite composer's coolest opera.   Practicing is not happening today. I think I need a mental break. I think it's marvelous. ;) Off to Prokofiev!!!

      arrgh blogger was down yesterday and so I apologize for the lack of random thoughts eminating from this direction. It's probably a good thing because yesterday was a BAD DAY. It started out bad, middle was kind of depressing, and well, I guess it ended alright but I still went to bed too late (and despite the fact that my 8:50 was cancelled I still got up too early), super tired and ready to chuck school and trombone and responsibility out the window (my trombone and I had a little spat yesterday. We talked today, though, and it's going to be okay)  But, today is friday!! And it should be an entertaining night. I know for sure Davis and Chris are coming, along with various members of the Tuba-Euph ensemble. When they get here, I'm firing up the wok for some good Lauren-style stir fry. That's going to be a lot of food. But it'll be fun! I should have told Ian to bring wine, when he asked if I need anything. Arrrgh. Oh well...should probably be sober for the Wisconsin Brass Quintet recital ;)  One of the greatest natural highs is playing bass trombone or tuba, man. I played bass for about two hours today. In quintet we did Promise of Living twice through the really loud part, and right in the middle of the trombone-tuba melody everything started spinning and I think my body and my consciousness were trying very hard to go opposite directions from each other. Unfortunately both of those directions involved the floor and I had to do some serious breath control in order to get back with it. Sweet. I'm still feeling the effects of oxygen overdose.   Man, having Megan in history class today would have been fun. Even though she claims (hmm) that she can't do the goat noise anymore, there was some serious sheep discussion revolving around the Strauss tone poem Don Quixote. mmmaaa!!! So, Megan, what do you say? ;) anyway, I'd better prepare for the stir fry herd. More later!

      I have to remember that, despite how busy I am, despite how tired and frazzled I get, there are people who love me. Here's a basic list of good things:   Basically, I spent 15 hours in and around humanities today. Brief breaks for lunch and dinner were taken, but no home-going was accomplished. Wind ensemble was actually amusing for once, since we had a guy auditioning for conducting and he was pretty dorky, but still good, anyway, Collin jabbed me hard in the side because he thought I was falling asleep, and i nearly jumped out of my chair I was so shocked, and plus I had to pee big time, so that was not so amusing. But he gave me a hug afterward and said I was a good sport. I got up to move chairs in the lounge and Ian asked if I was leaving and when I said no, he said, "good!" Mikey got a haircut. (it looks good) Davis wrote about me in her blog (and we should sit and have some in depth chat sometime, hun. ;), Ben sent me another email that summed up very well how I feel about soulmates and certain people, I got an email from Tara which was awesome! (i miss you too!) Terry gave me some hope today about making it through stressful times. Having someone tell you that "you can do it" is so awesome.  So a lot of people have told me I'm on the right track with common sense or whatever. I feel good about that. It doesn't matter that I spent all day in a concrete building trying to take another step toward proficiency with my instrument and mostly just being frustrated. It doesn't matter that I argued with my dad or anything like that.   I'm listening to the recording from my recital. Our balalaika duet was really cool. Gosh, I'm so witty. hehe..just kidding. It's weird to hear your own voice on recording. I remember growing up I hated it because it sounded so little and highpitched. But it doesn't sound so bad now. Funny, I really should be analyzing my trombone playing, not my voice. ;) Bethany sounds good! I'm a little afraid to hear the Larsson because I know the first mvt wasn't so good. But it's always worse in your mind than it really is. So, It'll be good to hear. It'll be good to go to bed, too...story of my life!!   Today's advice: schmu!

      did my last blog make any sense? I really don't even remember writing it. You know, today wasn't a bad day, but the more tired I get the later it gets in the day, the more I can't remember anything or think complete thoughts or anything. I just end up getting lonely and dejected. Weird, huh? Lonely in the sense that it's been way too long since my last physical encounter with the opposite sex. Sad. Way sad since the last physical encounter was Dave and man, that's three and a half years.  Dejected because, why can't I just get over myself and my hangups? Argh. I've decided I can't compete with people in social situations. I will always seek to be the retiring voice (unless of course it's an easily won battle, then i just talk too much) or come up with something entirely stupid and non-related to say. Hmm. My mind is just spinning around in circles searching for something to attach to. It's not having much luck.  You know what my first thought was? I should call Ryan. Whoa...bad idea. I shouldn't call him until I have something for us to do together. You know what? I'll probably do it anyway. Like I said before, I already know what I'm going to do, I just have to argue with myself for a while before I can accept it. I argue with myself A LOT. And yes, sometimes I do lose.   the main problem with my rant on living life is that it's totally incoherent. I apologize. Now, if I'm going to do what I'd said I'd do, I need to get offline.   good grief I have no common sense whatsoever

      Well, hello.  Ben warned me about the email he had sent me today regarding my blog, so I looked forward all today to getting it and reading it (I also had a few qualms about what exactly he would say), and I did indeed enjoy it. So my topic upon which I will expound today is:  life. most importantly what I have come to understand about it. Disclaimer: nothing I can actually put in writing will explain even basically how my brain is working. My brain travels in different orbits from everything else. When I speak of brain I mean that part of my mind devoted to figuring those deep thoughtful things out and processing the information so I can live life better. Unfortunately it takes light years for it all to get to the right planet. Ben, thank you much for your congratulations on being a human being and understanding my experiences. And I'm glad that I've instilled a sense of hope in you for thinking in similar circles. The whole Ryan situation is at a point where I'm starting to separate myself from emotion (it's still there) and look at it from a highly logical and probably overanalyzed perspective. Underneath is that layer of emotion that gets in the way and mucks everything up, yet to give it up would completely destroy everything I fight for. See, most of my growing up has been done by me. Sounds like a pretty obvious statement, huh? Well, what I mean is, a lot of people have someone or some people they can go to and talk about everything. And in high school (which i consider the place that really "made" me...college is making me grow up, but my stream of consciousness is born in high school, when I figured out how to think for myself and solve my own problems) I always felt a little separated from even my good friends because I couldn't always articulate my thoughts.  I'm not saying that I could go talk to anyone, I'm saying that something held me back. If I have a serious problem, chances are I've probably already figured it out for myself before I got talk to someone about it. I'm also just realizing right now that this probably doesn't make me any different from anyone else but still, I've always felt different in that any serious conclusion I come to I already know. I have a theory:  we already know everything we need to know, but it's just hidden from us. I tried this metaphor out on Bethany once (but I'm not sure she fell for it):  growing up (perhaps I should define:  meaning attaining levels of realization, or just becoming your own person, i guess) is like having the curtains opened in a dark room.  It doesn't happen all at once; light creeps in, you learn a little more, some more comes in, until someday (and far away at that) you're enlightened. Poof!! Does this make any sense? Basically what I'm saying is that my life up to this point and continuing past it is just one big opening of curtains. It's a step process. Perhaps that isn't the best metaphor. Maybe I can come up with a better one later, but now I have to go. Thanks Ben, for inspiring me to try to explain myself.   Upon reflection, I think I'd make a damn fine Buddhist. Well, maybe next life. :)

      Woo. What a day. What a long interesting day.  So, unless you're from RB and were in CYO, you'll probably not be interested in what I have to say next.  What's so exciting, fellow CYOers? Well, we had our trombone studio departmental tonight, and afterwards this guy was talking to Bill whom struck me as sooo familiar. I went to go tell Sean and Miah that they rocked (because they did) when Bill called me over and said, hey, you should talk to this guy, he's from San Diego. So I'm thinking, ok, so I'm getting closer to recognizing him. Introductions, hi, I'm Lauren, Hi, I'm Mark. WHOA! You were in CYO!!! I sat next to you!! Hey! How's it going? Meanwhile, Bill's like, ooooookay...so he left and we talked about Mike Muna and Melissa Pina and Aaron Westfall, which was soooo weird because I'm the middle of WISCONSIN...I'm not supposed to know anyone who knows anyone I know from home which is halfway across the country....my mind was boggled. Anyway, he was in town because he goes to Oberlin and his gf lives in Deforest, WI, so they just decided to stop by and hear some trombone playing. He said to me, and this was an awesome thing to say but I'm not so sure how true it was:  "If i remember your playing correctly, you could have made it into Oberlin piece of cake." !!!!!!!! wow. That's a nice nice nice thing to say.  So, We exchanged email and phone and the essentials...It's so weird. It's SOOOO weird. I'm still in complete shock. Yipes.   Anyway, that's my major news. Everything else is the same: I'm tired, I've got lots of Buddhism reading (but actually not that much because I got semi-caught up this past weekend). Finally had Inspector Gadget rehearsal, made a rhythmic fool of myself in quintet, tbone 4tet is wednesday morning and i'm looking forward to it. I should go get my laundry. I might have more to say later. I might not. Don't wait up. ;)

      I got three good compliments on my blog today. From Davis, Chris, and Jon (via email) saying they enjoyed reading it. So, hurray for me! By the way, Jon....GOOD LUCK! Music is a hard thing to study, but you have to remember, never be too dificult or harsh with yourself. Musicians have the best parties. ;)   Do I have anything else to say? Hardly. Here's a favorite quote of mine:   "That's the worst of girls," said Edmund to Peter and the Dwarf.  "They never can carry a map in their heads."   "That's because our heads have something inside them," said Lucy --from Prince Caspian by CS Lewis  Hey Chris...your dinosaur has no teeth, and you're a Sorry bitch. (evil laughter)

      all hail lazy sundays. i haven't left the house yet, except to go grocery shopping. it was just way too nice to sit on my bed and sort through pictures and read buddhism and not think about practicing for a while. I have to spend enough time at humanities tonight, i want to make it a one-time thing. Yes, I got a good night of sleep for the first time in about a week, i'm still tired but that's alright, at least i'm refreshed. I just ate a lot of rice. I'd love to take a nap....hmm, survey:  should I take a nap or practice? I should practice. As much as I don't want to go out in the 20 degree weather, napping might just end up being superficial right now, and besides, I promised myself I'd work tuning on the bass EVERY day. So. here I go....no really, i am going....

      It's always so cool to see Brandon again. He rocks, man, I mean it. I feel bad but I wish I could have hung out with them after Jon's recital tonight. Alas, I'm the resident hairdying specialist, so my talents were called upon. But that's alright, because I still had a good time.    Now I'm just wondering what the hell is going on upstairs, there's a lot of dropping noise going on. Hmm. You know what else is evil? It's snowing. For cryin' out loud. That's just cruel. I put away the longjohns and the winter coat. Don't make me do this Wisconsin, it's not going to be pretty.   Anyway, I'm tired, but happy. And have the room to myself tonight...finally, a night of sleep that's worth it!! Roomates and boyfriends...maybe it's a good thing I can't get any, because it's annoying to have to sleep on the sofa or be awakened by arguing at 2 in the morning. Needless to say I don't want to reciprocate.   G'night. ;)

      swimming is wonderful.  the only problem is you have too much time to just let your mind wander. my mind wanders very easily. I would not be very good at meditation. ;) Maybe you can guess where my mind was wandering to....  well, anyway, I'd love to go out and be a wild child tonight, but the party scene has just been pretty dismal lately. Next weekend, thankfully, Jason is having a shindig, so maybe I can save my #1-party-school-in-the-nation-attendee instincts for then.  Instead it's hair dying night...first Bea and then Bethany. And hopefully I'll have time to catch Best in Show at the Union. Good grief... my spring fever is bad this year. It's cold again today. Listen, Wisconsin, it's almost April. Get your butt in gear and bring me some 70 degree weather.   grr...

      My mission: to overcome feelings of jealousy and learn to let people be their own people.  I'm getting better at this, but there are still some people...it's just hard for me to think that they can, not quite ignore me, but at least expand upon other friendships and such when I want to be the closest to them.  Hans told me once (and many thanks to him for it) that he thought I was a jealous friend...and the more I thought about it, the more I saw he was right. So slowly, I'm learning, but I've reached a road block with Ryan. So here's what I'm thinking:  B and I show up to see his band, and they are not on yet, so we sit and talk to him for a while, he's talking to a friend as well. And somehow I feel that in the time that I haven't seen him, this girl has somehow taken my place. Not just in becoming his friend, but in becoming the sort of friend that I am to him, in my mind. "In my mind" is the key here, I'm at the same time feeling like a total psychobitch for thinking these crazy thoughts. But they are there, and only invalid if i can work around them.  But anyway, she flirts with him just the same as I do, he pays attention to her, and yet it's one of those messed up Ryan-leading-people-astray sort of things. You can kind of tell she's got something for him.  So now I'm jealous, mad at myself for being psycho, and furious with Ryan for messing with someone else's emotions the same way he did with mine, all at the same time.  So, after they played, what's going through my head? "Get out of here as soon as possible or everything's going to go to hell..." Waited only as long as they could tear down their set, and grabbed Ryan, thanked him for inviting me, and posed the question on my mind:  "So, are you still superbusy or do you want to hang out some time?" Answer is, yes. So he says, "call me" and I give him my best don't-pull-that-shit-on-me look. But he says, "Well, I just called you..." and I'm thinking, "what a complete boy. He's just a frustrating, stupid boy.." at the same time as "why the hell I am so weak around this character?" but instead I say, "alright, I'll call you." And hightail it out of there. There might have been a trail of smoke behind me, I don't know because I didn't stop to look. And poor B, having to listen to me analyze every last drop of my psyche devoted to relationship-self-esteem, probably just wanted to shoot me and remind me that she's heard it ten million times before (which would not be an exaggeration).   Ok, here's my deal:  All I really want is just to hang out with him, because I miss it. We can be friends or lovers, it doesn't matter. Everyone has at least a handful of people that are absolutely essential to their  existence, and he is one of mine. In fact he may very well be near the top of the list. What kills me is that I don't think this sort of existential soul-mate crap is mutual. Or if it is, he's fighting it for some reason, and this "i'm busy" charade is just a way of escaping...something. I've got to have it be all or nothing; I can't spend two months not talking to him and then talk to him, because then I'll never break free of this situation. I don't want to give him up completely because then there would be a huge hole. I suppose it would scab over in time, but never really heal.  But my solution is obviously not his solution.   what the hell am i supposed to do?

      schmu  going to see ryan's band tonight...survey: is this a good thing or a bad thing?  Saw him on wed night and had really no reaction, bad or good. it was more of a "i've moved beyond you and you can't seduce me with your sparkling wit anymore" type of thing. Except maybe not so much sparkling wit. So why, when I heard his phone message tonight, did I listen to it twice? And why did I immediately say I wanted to go?  He's still a punk boy and I'm still a silly too-quick-to-emotion girl.  I'm still going to go. I have to prove to myself that I can get him out from under my skin. Six months is far too long to be under someone's spell and not get anything for it. All hail the triumph of Lauren's logical side...Rah! Rah!  Wish me luck...

      If nothing in the world is ulitmately real, than anything is possible.  Wow...talk about a power lecture today in buddhism. holy flying hippopotami. I think I understood it...but...i guess if all you do is sit around and meditate you have time to figure out that we are all in Buddha's paradise basically because he's using us to make sure that he will ultimately be "blissed out" as Prof. Dunne calls it. A buddha's compassion is only a means to an end in his search to obtain his own ultimate happiness.   Why doesn't it seem like we are in paradise? Because we are ignorant and the ignorance in our mind creates delusion and karma and karma leaves an imprint (even after it is expended) that clouds our vision of the world. Therefore, when we break free of the samsara prison and see without ignorance, we will know Buddha's paradise. BUT!! If you are a bodhisattva, you must create your own paradise before you become enlightened because otherwise you will exist in a negative state of meditation in which you can neither hurt NOR help anyone. And you can remain like that for billions of aeons before you wake up and then what happens? i have no idea. But anyway, before you are a buddha, you have intention, and through that intention you can create your own paradise. Anything is possible!! A buddha has no intention, therefore you must do it before. So, my question is:  If we're all in Sakyamuni Buddha's paradise right now, what happens when someone finishes creating their paradise and POOF becomes enlightened? Do we all move to his paradise because otherwise he can't be truly happy. Sure, he's enlightened, but his final goal is bliss. So he needs everyone else to be happy too. What's going on here? So we all have to become Buddhas, but we all must have our own paradise. hmm  so, ignorance is NOT bliss?

      my friend Jennii has a blog, I'll link it when I figure out how, but anyway: www.littlegiraffe.blogspot.com Hi Jennii!!!  welcome to the week of long-ass days. wednesdays are not supposed to be long-ass for me, but today was. mostly because practicing tenor today was freaking me out because of this ringing sound in my tone..sounded like it was the bell reverberating at certain pitches...well, i was worried that it might be my embouchure from switching bass to tenor, bea was getting the same thing but terry (who is a cool cat, many thanks to terry for assuaging bea's annoyance and my fears) suggested that it was just something in the practice rooms that was responding to the pitches because they were especially in tune. so, a bad thing is really a good thing! the buzz is not permanent and it means o'm playing in tune. go me...now if i could only do that on bass...   As you may have noticed, i've decided to make capital letters as rare as possible today. captial letters are just another plot set up by the institution to bring you down, man! heh. well anyway, i'm too lazy for them. at least i have the house to myself for once this week!! maybe i can take a nap....yay naps. now i can take naps on my bed because it no longer takes two years to get into it and sort out the sheets and MR. FISH (he gets caps because that's his name, caps are essential)  and pillows and such.  nice. i wonder how long i have before my next commitment. I should check that out. women's composer's concert tonight, then the dodectet for brass bash. organizing the trombone 4tet is appearing to be more work than finding a decent time for octet. how does that work? the number of people involved is doubled, yet it's easier? hmm..maybe because i seldom see jason and erin long enough to work out a time. felicia, well she's part of the locker gang (or sean's "harem") so it's easier. still..never all at once! i have to run about like crazy and i feel like a goat...bleating out times at people and eating their clothing. well, not so much on that last part. maybe a little nibble once and again.   that being said, i'm going to play a little jaaazz trumpet for y'all.

      Alright...I'm excited...first rehearsal for Felicia's fine arrangement of Inspector Gadget for brass octet and percussion. Hoping that everything goes well, since I don't know if we have a percussionist or even access to the auxilliary stuff we need. Argh. But..if that all works out, it'll be cool! Organizing this stuff is a headache though...I know I can be scatterbrained sometimes but dealing with nine other busy people all at once can lead to issues.  Speaking of issues, I think I've developed a complex. It's a very very very silly complex.  You see, this one stall in the humanities bathroom had a toilet paper roll holder that didn't exactly hold the toilet paper:  When you pulled on the paper, the shell covering it would come loose and fall on your head. This happened to me a couple times. Most of these times it scared the heebeejeebies out of me. It also was rather painful. Anyway, they fixed it over break I guess.  But I was getting some toilet paper today and I swear....I swear that the toilet paper holder moved in threat to fall upon my head!! But I looked again, and it was stable. I verified; yup, still stuck fast to the stall wall. So great, now I've got a complex. About toilet paper holders. Thanks a lot, life.  Well, off to spend eight million more hours at the concrete palace.

      I'm done!! Hurrah! (lauren does a little dance celebrating doneness and buddha wisdom) Well, yay. It's actually  not too bad. I like it when it's not too hard to do a good job. Goes against everything my parents told me about working hard and the satisfaction of accomplishment...yah, well, so I'm on some basic level unmotivated. ah well. ;)  My computer is freaking out...I should shut the poor thing down...I left it on last night and today trying to defrag and it wasn't even past 30% when i got home around 8:30 tonight. arrgh. Fine, be that way, computer! Create your own world of self-destruction!!!  Pbbbt. I'm going to bed now. Really. G'night.

      taking a buddha break! Yay midterms...well, i'm almost done at least, just one more two page essay. Shouldn't be too bad, eh? Well, since it's the only thing going to our grade in this class, it'd better be good. Hmph.  Long day, eh? four hours straight of rehearsal (first wind ensemble and then brass quintet). BQ was fun though...we're going to have to learn to stay on task or we'll never get anything done..well, that's not true. I need to sit down with the bass and focus on intonation because that thing's a beast!!! The bell's a little shorter than my tenor bell, so it throws of my conception of where each position is. I felt kind of bad in rehearsal, since I was having trouble finding some of the lower slide positions  arrgh. But, I think it'll be good (yeehaw optimism) since it's already better than it was last week. Anyway, looks like it's time to get cracking on good ol' Buddha wisdom again...wish me luck!!!

      Hey, look at me! *shows muscles* I'm the bomb! I just fixed our vacuum cleaner, that we continued to use even though it had no bag inside of it to collect the crap from our floor..and then the zipper was stuck...Well, anyway, I dragged that sucker outside, fixed the zipper, installed a dustbag (that actually took me a while, since I kept messing up the bags and had to use two before I finally got it right), zipped it back up and proceeded to vacuum our carpets. Pretty proud of myself. So, I always seem to be productive with cleaning things when I'm trying to avoid something else (ahem...buddhism?), I think that's a pretty good way to be non-productive. yay.

      Hello, I'm alive!! (but just barely) I've decided that travelling alone is the worst. At least when things go wrong and you have someone there to laugh about it with, you don't go as insane. So, if someone were to give me a match, right now, you know what I'd do? I'd take that bus right back down to O'Hare and set it on fire. That's right. POOF, up in flames. Goodbye, United Airlines! waHAHAHAHAhahaha!!!!!!!!!  anyway, let's not talk about that. I've decided I'm becoming a strange person. Not only have I started to actually like getting up before 10 am, I gave up carbonated beverages and drinking (well, maybe not so much "give up"...)It's weird. I'm supposed to be a college student. Pizza and beer and sleeping until 1 or 2. Ah well...whatever makes you happy, eh?   It's nice and sunny outside, and listening to sublime makes me feel like I'm still at home, but guess what?!?!? It's kind of cold outside. Poopy Wisconsin and it's poopy winters. Ah well, it's time to get cleaned up and face the world (or rather, the Humanities building).

      i'm stuffed...remind me not to eat for a while. Good thing tomorrow is back to school and the return of ramen noodles. Mm...shrink-wrapped soup...  Two situationally funny stories. First, on the subject of tourists in La Jolla: An elderly lady, walking past the mexican restaurant Jose's ( ho -seh's), comments, "Oh,  Joe -seh's! That looks interesting..."  Second, on bathroom capers and things you don't see too often: Waiting for the bathroom at Tamarindo's, I'm watching as a man walks up and opens the door to the men's room, but closes it quickly; there's someone in there. Ten seconds later, not one but  two  (2) guys shuffle out of the bathroom. One of them gives a baleful grin at the waiting man and says, "no harm done, eh mate?"   well, gotta jet and wish Megan Mango a happy birthday. Goodbye San Diego! this shall be my last post in thy fair mediterranean clime...

      i love my fishes cuz they're sooo delicious, gone gold fishin'  sitting sitting and humming commecial jingles pondering snack food working up the inspiration to do something productive  my friend sean in hs used to sing this song: I like trafficlights I like trafficlights I like trafficlights but not when they are red. crazy boy-the only person i've ever known who loves the movie  Flight of Dragons  as much as I do. Dropped off the face of the planet...or rather, he fell into Provo, Utah and had a hard time getting out. I wonder if being Mormon is harder for the person or the person's friends.   hmm Salma Llarabia. Jon, we never did take over Europe, but you know I think it's okay. We didn't have enough salmon hats and octopus jello anyhow. Pfft!  it's time to go be productive. productive=napping.

      Cadillacs were designed by the devil. Ours in particular has reached a certain level of hellishness that is seldom matched. Drives like a cow, parks like a cow, smells like golf....that will need some explaining. All my dad's golf stuff is in the back and in the trunk and it's become one big cloud of sweat and grass and dirt that settles upon the nose and tenaciously  refuses  to let go until you've opened the window and stuck your head out of it several times. One of the reasons I despise the sport of golf. It's that bad. On top of all this, I can barely see over the steering wheel no matter how I adjust the damn seat; I think it was designed specifically for little old grannies who like to drive 15 mph with their heads barely clearing the dash. Anyway, it takes me nearly five minutes to park (plus another five if you count the amount of time it takes me to find a spot big enough), and ten minutes to get out of the parking spot and then I have to make sure I don't scrape the sides of any other cars when I'm trying to turn right because the things so DAMN HUGE...sigh...well, end my rant on cadillacs.  Man, Sean, my private teacher from high school, is awesome. He just rocks. We spent an hour and a half tonight just playing duets and for once I think I actually did him credit. I saw Mr. Grant (and he raved about Doug Hill for awhile), and my Boys, Brian, Ben, Brandon and Nick (one of these things is not like the other..well, Nick missed being under my proverbial "wing" by a year). I miss those kids... so...i just got back from an interesting evening with Katie and Alan Grant and the infamous Blake. Katie and I went and hung out at their bq rehearsal and got invited to join them at TGI Friday's...I listened to Katie mercilously torment Blake on the subject of relationships, and Alan not so overtly criticize the quintet and its current politics...so much shit has been going down with chamber groups lately, it's kind of depressing. Hope hope hope that everything will work out with Brasso Continuo...It should. I found out also that Brian took an audition in New England with Doug Yeo and before he even left the chair they offered him a full ride. That kid's so amazing..I wish I had talent like that. Man...but that's okay, as Jeff always said, you do the best that you yourself can do. It's so weird, I get home and everything starts to center around high school again. Basically, it's all you can talk about with your old friends...or it's all your old friends can talk about, or something, but it always returns. I realized the other night that part of my struggle in high school was just to be as recognized as all the high talent in the band...Katie, Mike, Negrete, Jeff, they all had it easy...second trombone just doesn't get as much attention. Coming on the heels of this is Alan's comment: "It's so nice to see that that timid little girl has disappeared." Yeah that's true..I have grown a lot. Most of it is college, or just growing up, but part of me takes offense. Not too much of me. Just a little bit of pride rearing its ugly head. Katie kept turning the conversation back to her, or her and Blake. I wonder how often anyone in high school really thought I had anything to say?   Silly me...being upset about this now. Sometimes it haunts me though...this first half of the semester I felt pretty alienated. I don't even remember why, probably something about being nervous about my recital and still coming off the low of my winter break-long examination of self (in which I managed to dredge up every embarrassing and stupid thing I've ever done and analyze every last inch of my poor beleaguered psyche). I do remember freaking out after the Splinters concert, wanting to talk to Ryan but feeling stupid and pushy and shy all at the same time..and Emily not helping at all, or not understanding, or maybe just thinking I needed to get over it all. So I went home feeling flustered and wishing I had just gone and talked to him. After all, he called me afterwards and apologized for not saying anything to me. You know...nobody ever really listens to anyone else. It's just one big mess of miscommunication. That's all society's problem is..miscommunication. All stemming from ignorance which is the root of suffering..ah, hell, I still have my buddhism midterm to do. Sigh.  g'night, sleep tight, don't let the manahoonies bite!

      Ok, so what's new? General excitement: I would like to send out a warm and hearty congratulations to my dear friend Brandon for being promoted. Instead of just doing education work for the Florentine Opera in Milwaukee, he's now in charge of Public Relations! Next stop, top of the world. ;) He also sent me a neat picture from when he was in  Falstaff.   Anyhoo, recovery from my minor emotional setback of last night is progressing nicely. There's just some people you can't forget, no matter how hard you try. To quote a popular 80s song: "there is always something there to remind me." Well, shit...that really blows! Sometimes, you don't want to remember, you just want to be angry at the person because anger will fade, whilst sad little achings of the heart take longer.  It just does absolutely nothing for my self-esteem. I mean..well, what do I mean anyway? Maybe I should just get a grip.

      i just got home from a highly amusing game of frisbee with Mike and Sean and Chris...and it's raining and it smells so good! I think I might go stand in it for a while rather than get started on my theory paper...theory paper, shmeory paper, right?   NO...I should do it. Then I can go to bed earlier. Cara and I stayed up late last night talking about a lot of stuff..we haven't talked in a while and it was good. I was just about to say that it's surprising how not tired I am, but just then that wave of exhaustion hit me and i'm urged by my body to go curl up in a ball and take a nap...however, nap = not doing theory paper. Arrgh, life.

      I'm feeling that compositional urge again. Mainly because the idea I have for a piece is really cool and I think the finished product (if there ever is one at the rate I'm moving) will, if not revolutionize the twelve-tone music scene, at least raise a few eyebrows. Ok maybe not. It's pretty tonal, anyway, tonal using 12 tone as a structural idea. So we'll see.   Don't sweat the small stuff. Don't sweat the big stuff either. In fact, try not to sweat anything. Unless you're hot and your body is looking for an efficient way to cool down. In that case, sweat water. Anything else can get kind of sticky.   If you'd like any more earth-shattering advice, you can request it of me in an email. I only accept cash and checks, no credit cards. Thanks, have a great day.

      perhaps I should have clarified: Jealousy VS sentimentality was a problem yesterday. Meaning, what's the difference in my head? When I think I'm being sentimental am I really just jealous about something related?  I dunno. Sometimes I think I really don't know anything. ;)  Got together with Ryan today to work out some details in the piece I'm playing on his recital...and it was a little strange. He was almost very professional in manner, and it freaked me out (professional in the sense that he can be so, which you probably wouldn't understand unless you knew him...it's sort of a quirky messed up sort of organization) because I realized how far away from each other we've gotten. Even in levels of comfort. That pains me. Of all the people I can be myself around, he makes me the most comfortable. That's quite a task. Dammit. I know I know...this should be something I'm past already (according to a lot of people, but how often do I accept the majority?) but moving ahead is just a pain in the ass.   Jennii's blog from yesterday is really good and sums up all my feelings about beach bonfires. A bonfire is, in my ever so humble opinion, the best friend gathering you can have. (except for that one where Dave hit me in the mouth with a frisbee and the drunken baseball league dads tried to set us on fire) There is nothing that makes me happier.

She's not one of my bestest best friends for nothing, you know. ;)  Today?: It's nice out, with very little wind! Speaking of wind, wind ensemble concert tonight..I'm really looking forward to it...we've been working on this music for a long time and I think it's going to be really really good. So y'all come if you're in Madison!!!  I ate too many grapes and now my stomach's a little unsettled. arrgh.

      Tonight actually made me feel like I was at college. Our neighbor, James, rings the doorbell and gives us beer and asks to borrow the grill...so i let him and he made hamburgers for us and it was great. It's warm outside, the beer is cold, and the hamburger is yummy. and the friends are fun. College is not like this near enough anymore. This summer has to be like that. There must be lots of outdoor cooking fun. That being said, I'm going to play a little jazz trumpet for y'all.

      How come it is that whenever I most want to talk to someone, everyone I call or try to get in touch with is not there?   It's that time of year. I'm starting to feel lonely again but it's ironic...I'm sick of dealing with boys and trying to make them like me. It's just one humiliating experience after another. There's always something I miss and therefore end up feeling like a fool. It's been three years since someone's made me feel like I was attractive. Three years? Is that legal? Nevertheless, Bob Marley is playing outside my window and he's telling me, "everythings going to be alright..no woman no cry" which is entirely appropriate for this mood I'm in, so I think I'll go sit outside and listen to him.

      i'm slowly remembering some things about living that i knew just a few weeks ago and then forgot in the hurricane of emotion that came my way. Good news though--I'm back! hurray!   The thunderstorm last night was so loud that it woke me up a couple of times. Some of those times I think I was still dreaming, but it was crazy!! the wind was blowing so hard one of my posters on the outside wall started to fall off. Weird. Cara didn't come home, either. So, as is usual on a Saturday morning, the house is all mine and I can do laundry and eat and listen to music and relax. I can't wait until summer.

      I registered today. 12 credits. Rock on.   there's nothing like taking a shower in the middle of the day. Now I'm going to go sit outside and sweat a bit but still feel refreshed and happy about not being in Humanities. I'm back on track with practicing, and even though my lips were a little sketchy today, at least I'm getting in the time. And I don't have a lesson tomorrow, so I can catch up a little. Cool cool.   ah, but there's a theory test. Eek!

      nifty cool thing for the day: I can take a max of 13 credits for the next four semesters and then, poof, graduate! How nice is that...how scary, too eh?  This good news comes on the heels of me being rather depressed today about not having time to actually BE a musician and not just a college student studying music. I asked myself too many questions about where I was musically and how I liked the current education I'm receiving and I ended up making a healthy, realistic and pretty sound decision (it's too complicated to explain and besides, I don't feel like doing it) yet still feeling a little down about everything. Downness and I have been one lately. Grr.   I went for another run with Mike...I'd tell you how I feel but today's been a day of bitching already and I need to stop. Time for bed.

      it's snowing. how rude.   Well, not much to say except that I took a stab at composition today (seriously, instead of just randomly improvising on the piano when I don't feel much like playing scales) and it didn't turn out too badly. I have to be careful though, or it'll take up all my time and I'll never practice. I had fun though...it's a long way from done but Ryan said he'd play it for me sometime (which is good because my limited piano skills can't play it as fast as I'd like). Hurray!   I wish Jennii would write something! Hey Hans...it's been a month. ppppbbbt!!! ;) j/k love ya bunches.

      Bethany and I invented a new dialect. It's called "Bonics."   Grammatical Rules:  -all one syllable words stay the same -two syllable words, take off the first letter; example: Pencil= Encil.  -two syllable words like straighten, with more than one consonant, take off the group of consonants before the first vowel ("aighten") -two syllable words beginning with a vowel take off the entire first syllable. Ex: April= Ril -words with three or more syllables, take off the entire first syllable. Ex: Computer= Puter.  Exception: Garbage Can, which should technically be Arbage Can, is instead, Bage Can.  The Cat House:  Ily Any Ra Auren  Y uestions?  Tact me a mail.

      ok, yeah, I'm sore. Hell yeah! Hehe...play with pain, my dad used to tell me when I didn't want to go to swim practice. argh.  I did this Dalai Lama quiz thing that Felicia sent me. Some of it did work out too well, but I did put Ryan for red (someone you truly love) and got a little freaked out. Mostly because I don't feel any sort of connection at all there anymore...that forced distance thing is really taking its toll. I used to be afraid to admit love for people...but love is such an all encompassing topic....I have great emotion for lots of people (little soft spots in my heart I like to call them) which amounts to love but it doesn't mean I am IN love...critical difference, right? Well, I don't suppose I'd know much about it.  I'm "supposed" to send the quiz to the number of people that is my favorite number, but I sure as hell am not sending it to 721 people. Besides I don't subscribe to that anyway.  Not like I don't want my wish to come true.....;)

      First step to regaining happiness:  going running with Mikey? Yikes I feel like my heart's trying to jump out of my body, and making a valiant effort to take my lungs with it.  It's alright, I'm all good. Apparently it's put me in a Beatles mood (or maybe that's because I've had A Day in the Life stuck in my head since this morning).  Last night's blog was refering to what Bethany said to me last night:  She came in and sat on my bed and said "i want to talk about your problems" (good intro, eh?) She thinks I've been projecting an attitude of being not only way too stressed out but also not exactly happy in all my friendships. She wasn't exactly clear about it being just lately or always (she said something about me being cool right after breaks and then being annoyed by people as the semester wears on)....but in my personal opinion it's just been lately...because I love my friends here unconditionally and if I get upset or crabby with them it's usually because I'm crabby because of myself and not them. And it made me a little sad because I don't want to project an air of unhappiness with people, I think I am a basically joyous person and I don't want people to think otherwise. I dunno...Jennii and Ben did a good job of putting things in perspective for me. :) thanks much.   My, but it's a challenge to be a social individual sometimes, isn't it?

      sheesh. i'm out of shape. I dusted off the bike and brought it up from the basement this morning, and rode it to and back from Humanities. Now I'm going to ride it to the SERF, but my heart's still pounding. Uhoh. It's a good thing I'm going to do more exercise. ;)  What's the correct reaction when someone on the street you don't know makes a nasty comment toward you? Here's an example: I was going to get a bagel this morning for breakfast, wearing my UC Davis sweatshirt and feeling better good about being up as early as I was. This older man, standing out front of the store, says, "UC Davis?" And I nodded and smiled, and he says, "well, that sucks. Are you from California?" "yes" "Ugh, yuck" He was totally serious about it too. I didn't say anything else and just went in to get my bagel. Reflecting back on the whole issue, though, I wish I had stopped to talk to him and inquire more deeply into this hatred of my home state. Not in really any argumentative sense (although I did feel like calling him various bad names) but just out of curiousity. I'd say next time, but I doubt I'll get the opportunity again. Ah well.

      I made a conscious decision tonight not to go to Russian Orch. I was standing in front of Van Hise, looking forlornly at the 14th floor, and alternatively looking longingly at the lake and the mist that was setting over the grass by Liz Waters. So I went and I sat at the scenic point instead of going to rehearsal. Everything was so sublime and it was just cold enough to keep me aware of every last detail of the scene. In many ways it reminded me of the day spent at Lake Geneva, just walking in the drizzle by myself and trying to regenerate some sense of control. I think in my quest to become a more outwardly expressive individual I've lost a lot of the qualities of the introvert I truly am.  I think it's bad thing. It's necessary for me to escape once and a while and not talk to anyone just so I can recooperate. Except today, it didn't really work. I still have that choke in my throat and I still feel like I can't express the emotion that currently grips me. I thought of a metaphor today, while practicing:  I feel like my role in the social situations around me is falling behind. It's like when you're trying to practice with a metronome, and you're slowing down, and it seems to your ears that the metronome is getting faster. No one else is really speeding up, you're just behind. And it's almost a hopeless feeling. I wish I could snap out of this foul mood. But in some part of my brain, the darker, more thoughtful part, I question the desire to be happy. What's to be so happy about? people are stupid, society is messed up...But this is not right either. Where's the middle way? Too many jealous and petty thoughts came to mind today. I read too deep into just about everything and I teared up once or twice about nothing in particular. What's wrong?  Hey, Megan...I miss you!

      well, I just ordered my football tickets. getting set for another fun fall of drunken football fans screaming obsenities and making up clever taunts in order to keep Camp Randall the most "intimidating place in college football"   I decided today: There are those people you just KNOW are going to be good and successful musicians eventually. I'm going to be one of those people. And if no one believes me, hell, I'll just surprise everyone. So that's my great revelation of today...Now! I have to keep it. I have to keep practicing and being strong and not let being tried effect me so much. Hahahah...we'll see.

      brash bash: good times. It's over!! And there was the customary good ol times Paisons chill afterwards. What I miss most about last year is just hanging around with really cool people on a Tuesday night and be crazy sacrilegious over a glass of beer (or sangria, as the case may be). Not enough of that has happened this year. Not enough random fun "college" times. Everyone's way too tense. Man, tonight was way fun. That's what life's all about man. Relaxing. Doing all this stressful shit and then getting to loosen up and have a good time. Sigh. Hurray for Paisons! G'night!

      eating leftover stir fry and feeling good about myself for the first time all day.   As long as I can swim, I know I'll be okay. It's currently the only release I can find from school and stress and playing. It's the one thing in all aspects of my life that I've mastered and don't have to think about. Social situations are becoming more and more a challenge the more tired and crabby and crazy I get, and sitting in a practice room is just frustrating and not always helpful. Schoolwork keeps piling up, I have to learn to better balance myself, eat better, think better, live better. But if I have that hour to slip off to the pool and not be bothered, I know I'll be okay. I can control myself, I'm the driving force behind me, I know how to handle the water and the walls and there are no other external factors.   We never know that we are actually going somewhere until we can see and feel it ourselves.   Jennii...nice try ;)

      wow. last night was exciting. i don't think i can properly recount all the funny crap that happened, but man, it will live on in my memory as one of the coolest saturday nights ever. I'm proud of my mingling skills.  Another non-practicing day. Feels good. I think I'll be able to get back in full force tomorrow, after this mental break.

      I was just clicking through my hotmail inbox and i realized something: this past six months have flown by. I mean, sped by like so many reckless jetskiiers. The email mocking RB that Andy sent me was from december! That totally feels like last week. But then, on the other hand...some of the letters that Jessie and Brandon sent me in march feel like they're from ages ago. How does one cope with this realization that life is moving almost too fast for one to comprehend? There's a paragraph or two in Steinbeck's  East of Eden  that I was looking for last time I read...and unfortunately couldn't find. But it says something about how, at least for the author, that the times that fly by are the bad times, no matter how they seem to crawl at the time, because in retrospect you hardly remember them. It's the fun times, the laughs and the special stuff, that you retain every moment of for the rest of your life. I always thought that was interesting...the more I think about it, the more it makes sense. Good times from the semester are easy to pick out: Paison's after brass bash, staying up all night on new year's watching sex and the city (and getting caught on the roof for drinking sparkling cider hehe), frisbee, brass quintet, random happy evenings playing scattergories in the cat house, "Pete" and Jeff, and on and on and on. Not so much of the bad stuff sticks out. Maybe I'm lucky that good outweighs the bad. Maybe it's not the same for everyone. But still, I'm glad it's this way. Monty Python: "always look on the bright side of life"   that little rant was sponsored by Rubio's Fish Tacos. This next one is sponsored by MTV2: Watching a few random music videos tonight, I had a sort of "premonition" type thing. Some up-and-coming band was playing, and suddenly, in their place, i saw ryan's band.  it was weird. I was thinking, wow, i'm famous by association. that drummer dude, i can say to my friends, yah, he and i used to be good friends. i was/am totally in love with him. maybe i'll get to go backstage at all their big shows. maybe not. maybe it'll just be a big rock star mess. maybe we'll have an argument about why we didn't work out...maybe it'll have to do with the fact that i'm not band girlfriend material or too demanding or that he's just too involved in the music. maybe there will be a lot of drugs, and they'll make the wrong sort of friends and then end up as another tragic story on vh1's behind the music. maybe..maybe...maybe lots of things. and here i am predicting a future for a band that i only know one member of anyhow, and that i've seen perform twice. silly me! but anyway, that's what goes through my head when i'm watching this random band on tv.   I think...although i said yesterday that i didn't....that i do want to go back to school now. it's time to get started on practicing and working and having a good time. not that being home isn't. but it lacks a schedule. and that constant stream of friends that invades my house and makes me laugh...it lacks roomates and bikes and the humanities building. i miss madison. weird, coming from me who lives in one of the prettiest cities in america...but i do. i guess it's just more accessible. i'm sick of driving, i want my bike. i'm sick of living with just my parents, i want my roomies. it's time to start practicing again...time to start swimming and working and partying and being my own person. so...one more week!  this is going to be a long blog. i don't really feel like stopping. fingers crossed that blogger won't erase it.   bandos. what a weird thing to call ourselves. in college, it's music majors, or music dorks. i think. please stop me if i apply any incorrect term to the grouping of the musical profession. gotta have a clique, i guess. at least, i do. it's nice to have a small circle of friends and an outer one too, that easily rotates and lets you breathe a little. that's kind of what the music school means to me. i think one of the reasons i stuck with music was that feeling of always having someone to hang out with. i don't think i would have made it through freshman year with just the people i met in dorms and classes. I mean...the dorm wasn't exactly what i thought it would be. too many hormones, too much one-uping going on.  I used to think that that was one of the only reasons I stuck with music (besides my inherent love for the music, of course *rolls eyes*), but i think this desire to be practicing again is something new...something deeper. maybe i do really enjoy it. maybe it is something i can't live with out. wow.   ok, i think i can stop now. writing...it's like a companion. it keeps you company when you need to speak and it lets you say whatever. And for however you like. I used to keep a journal..but this is easier. My brain moves too fast for my pen, but my fingers can keep up okay. Thanks to high school typing class, the most tedious four months i've ever spent. And that my friends, as they say, is that.

      sigh---i wish i didn't have to go back to school quite yet. It looks as though there won't be time for a bonfire before I go back. Mike is going to Cancun tomorrow, for a week, so I'll be gone when he gets back, and all the hs kids are still in school. I went to RB's wind ensemble concert last night (or at least the last half..in my mad dash from CPR class in El Cajon to the Center in Escondido I was an hour and a half late...somehow i made the trip, which should take about 45 minutes, in 30. No, I wasn't going 85 the whole time...heheh)...it was awesome. I heard Brian play...that kid just blows me away (and almost literally, too)...he is an amazing amazing musician. They also played the third dance from On the Town, which made me happy because I love that music (and i get to play it this summer too). All in all they sounded great. It's a good hall for them--I wish we'd have played our senior concerts there before. Ah well.  Today is snorkling at the cove day...Mike Katie Adam and I are going. Abby is spending a few days with her relatives. Which reminds me, I must clean out some of the snorkling equipment. And find a swimsuit that's going to hold up to climbing over rocks and diving into deeper water (tuesday's beach episode proved that my new swimsuit is pretty but not very hardy when it comes to physical exertion. Another reason why I've always been devoted to competition suits). Anyhoo, as soon as Ahh-dam calls me back we're on our way. It might be a good idea to get dressed and take care of my chores first (oops).  Sunday-Disneyland!

      Well! long time no post. Lots of things to see and do, eh? We went to the beach today, and it was....awesome. I love the beach. the sky was blue, it was warm, I fell asleep on soft comfy sand, we swam and caught waves, it was great. I got a little bit of sun, but not too bad. New swimsuit lines and that's about it. Needless to say not much else is going on. I always feel as though all drama gets put on hold when I come back to CA...and starts right back up again at college. I suppose this makes sense. Still, I wish there would be some  drama at home. Liven things up a bit. My drama will start up again the next time Ryan calls me about a show his band is doing. Sigh. I've completely given into the drama. Sometimes....it's fun. ;)

      shimmy-shimmy cocoa pop, shimmy-shimmy pop!  hmm, don't know where that came from. anyhoo, i'm up way too early for a summer day. my mom fooled me this morning--she said (at 7:45) that she wanted to get going in fifteen minutes, so could i please get out bed to drive her? So I did. And then, at 8:05, she says, oh, we don't have to go until 8:30, I just didn't think you'd be ready so fast! Humph. a half an hour more of sleep, and such great dreams, too! sigh. But, I'm up, I have new contacts (my left eye is rebelling), and I'm hungry and just trying to pass the hours until I can go pick Abby up! Maybe I'll take a nap...mmmm, nap.

      I'd really like to just talk to someone right now. I forget how lonely it is at home--because you don't have roomates. At least, I don't. That's one time only-childness has failed me. And calling friends up at quarter to 11 on a weeknight is different at home...sleeping parents and politeness tactics to bother with and all.   I'm kind of nervous about something. I don't know if I should discuss it. It's not really nerves...well, just a sort of misplaced anxiety. I'm not even entirely aware what it's all about. Silly me. That's another thing, about being at home. I have too much time on my hands to think and pester myself with weird pits in the bottom of my proverbial stomach.   I'm going to go do something I shouldn't really do...but screw common sense, I have to look something up and remember what it's like. Cryptic enough? probably.

      Abby tomorrow! Hurray!  I'm still on the getting-job-and-gig-in-a-two-hour-span high. He needs help finding other reliable players, too, and so that should be fun...of course, my roomates would love to do it (hint hint) since he needs two horns and 3 violinists (although emily can only be one ;), oh yeah, and a cellist (alex?), bassist (i don't know ross that well but davis does...), and other assorted players. But! Of course no one really cares, not when they're off to Spain or not even school friends...sigh.   mm. mike is home tonight...i'll see him tomorrow. i must call adam-he'll know when marsha is done, too. and jon and eugene. and mary, and jennii comes home wednesday. jessie warned me not to call her until she's officially off the mouth-surgery drugs. dan and nat still have school but that's ok, there's time. i miss the davis kids:  megan, tara, sarah...and jeffbarr isn't home for a while either. well, my apologies but i'm using my blog as a tally for who's home and who's not...  there's a daria marathon on tonight...and i'm going to watch it. toodles.

      WOOOHOOO!!  What an exciting morning. It's not even noon yet and things are happening!!! My mom woke me up at 8 to take her to work, after which I promptly went back to bed for another hour...and then another half an hour, from which I was woken by my phone ringing (it was one of those surreal moments where you're not really sure what's going on and the phone seems like just another part of a dream).  The person on the other end of the phone was the person from the City of Madison---I got the lifeguarding job! Hurray! I'm missing all the training sessions, but I have to make them up when I get back. No problem.  Next stop, checking my email (since I've been cruelly forced out of bed twice, a third time falling asleep might be ill-fated).  Bonnie Abrams sent me a note about a swimming instructor job she found in the paper and----her son is conducting a musical this summer and needs trombonists. What's the musical? Ah. Ahem. Oooooh. Guess. It's my favorite  ever . It surpasses all musicals and then some, and not just because Frank was in the movie version. It made me dance about with joy the first time I saw it. It made me dance about, again with joy, this time mixed with pleasant surprise and excitement, when I saw those three fateful words in Bonnie's email. You have several hints. Guess. oh...what the hell. ON THE TOWN!!!!!!! Hurray! Hurray!  Needless to say, I emailed him right away. Another cool part is that he needs another 'bonist...and there are a lot of us crazy kids in town this summer. Collin, Erin, Emily, Beatriz, Jason, Sean....what fun if any of them were to do it! (i have my reasons for wanting a particular one...but the reason is very secret and must not be mentioned...)  alright..enough babbling about bernstein. i need to take a shower. (phew-ie!)

      dan and nat'ly, i think, are probably my two favorite people in the universe. that is, if i had to choose, and i hope i never do because it would be a very tough decision. but those two are topping the list. it's sort of hard to explain why...but if you hang out with them, you'd know immediately. they're crazy. tonight i surprised dan at drum corps and then we went to mission bay park to kick a soccer ball around. then we ended up wrestling, and other general mayhem. and then going to mikey's (a local coffee shop) to see some friends (one of them being my exboyfriend, dave, which couldn't help but be extremely awkward but we did our best and he was admirable in his attempts to say only what he needed to say to me), and chill. dan and natalie are the best. huzzah for them!   i think a little cable-television watching is in order. this opportunity so rarely presents itself to me, i must take every advantage i have. everyone going to spain....have fun and take lots of pictures and don't forget about me (you have my address, fools!). sniff! eat paella and befriend sexy spaniards!

      hmm...i got one of those email crush things today. those things bug me for several reasons:  1)it equates with an email forward 2)it makes me all nervous that someone likes me-good nervous, but of the kind that makes me not want to think about anything else 3)i start thinking of people i want to like me, and none of them probably do or would put my name down 4)i try to do it as a joke but then i realize that some of the people i put down might take it seriously and shit will go down 5)yuck. ok, fess up! who sent me the email? hehe...i don't really care, it just makes me all weird again inside, i don't need that.   anyway, my mom and i rifled through her old record collection last night. i made a couple good finds..i wish our turntable wasn't broken. some good ones: two beatles albums, sgt pepper's and revolver; a stan getz recording with count basie;  dave brubeck, time out; lots of santana (including abraxas); crosby, stills and nash (and that other dude ;); lots of beach boys; the american graffitti soundtrack--lots more too. my mom apparently had a thing for harry belafonte. it's comforting to know that at one point my parents had excellent musical taste, although i must say it's declined a little over the years (my mom's a big fan of amy grant now..no offence to any amy grant enthusiasts, and my dad listens to nothing but golden oldies).  Also, we uncovered the entire beatles album collection, put on tape by my uncle paul for my parents...but they never listen to it, so i'm stealing it from them. If only it were on cds...paul worked out this crazily complicated system of fitting all the albums onto just 7 tapes...so you have to do a bit of switching around if you want to  listen to an entire album. nevertheless, a good find!   hmm...get to see dan and natalie today! natalie is picking me up at five and we're going to meet dan at drum corps rehearsal. hurray! the ultimate in schmuness. speaking of, i do hope abby calls me tomorrow so i can pick her up from the airport. that'd be neet.

      i'd like to see phat phunktion again...that was one of the most fun tuesday nights i've ever had...and plus, a random person told me i was a good dancer (not a boy, unfortunately, but still appreciated).  the reason i bring this up is that i'm listening to Tower of Power's funky rhythms and it makes me want to dance. not with my parents in the house though.   what a weird, do nothing day. i got out of bed at noon (i woke up at eleven but i read for awhile), went to lunch (mm...oscar's) with my mummy, helped her plant one of the back gardens (i picked out the flowers: snapdragons, a weird strain of daisy that's bright orange, delphiniums, and cosmos) and got some ideas and advice for making my own garden back in madison. I want sunflowers...i love sunflowers. they're so ridiculously huge.   my train of thought for the day: it seems to me like everyone i meet and care about in the world is undeniably special and cool. part of my self-esteem issue lies in trying to live up to all this coolness in myself...and part of my jealousy problem extends into the fact that i hate to think or hear anything bad about any of the supercool people. if you're reading this and wondering, don't worry, my ratio of who's cool and who's not to me is high in favor of the cool. cool is one of those terms...it limits me, it makes me feel sort of illiterate or something. you know, vernacular in a sense. but there's nothing wrong with that. i just wish words would more readily express themselves to me. here we go now, i started out this paragraph with the intention of exploring my feelings for the human race and ended up in linguistics. bah. nevermind.

      "dear prudence....won't you open up your eyes?"  i'm feeling the urge to go on a cd buying spree.  here's what i want to get:  if i can find it, simon and garfunkel's concert in central park cake's first cd a tower of power cd with so very hard to go and what is hip? or la suerte de los tontos on it.  mussorkgy's pictures at an exhibition some more beatles. you can never have enough.   we see how it works out. it's a beautiful day in san diego...mild, sunny, blue skies and lots of promise. what shall i do today? i ought to practice, but we'll see how that ends up working out. what's marvelous is that i don't have to worry about doing any projects for school-type things. that is the most exciting and wonderful feeling ever. hurray for me!   i was thinking awhile back that'd it be awesome to have a school of music baby photo contest. or, to be less complicated, do it between sai and the phi mu boys. maybe i'll make that one of my projects for the fall. along with the whole vp membership deal. when i talked to bonnie on wednesday she said she'd like to see sai get more organized and less apathetic to volunteering and easier to work with. i'll pass that on.   obladi, oblada life goes on...bra la la how the life goes on

      coolness:  just hung out with katie and danny. talked about band, mr. cole, college, and partying... feeling better about that whole conversation with hans about ryan...geez, i hate that question, 'How's your love-life?' hehe...no offense dear, you needed updating. sadly enough i don't really have a love-life, so the answer to that question is always a little dim and uninteresting. katie said: 'you're the one person i know who's truly deserving of a really good man.' hmm. well, if that's true, i'm waiting! start lining up at my door, really good men! listen to me, i sound like i'm bridget jones, thirty-something and desperate to find a functional relationship.  a non-functional relationship would work alright for me now, just to keep the ol' self-esteem at a reasonably acceptable level. I know i'm bitching. I'll stop. I know all the old mantras about love and relationships, but i don't care to hear them. if you want to give me advice, send me chocolate.  chocolate inspires great things.   well, jetlag has caught up to me, time to go to bed. smooches everything, sleep tight. :) and keep sending in those prospective cow names.

      Well, I'm alive!! The least complicated flying I've done in a while. Usually something disastrous transpires and I'm stuck in Chicago ready to spit. But surprisingly, all went smoothly.   I bought this keychain that made me nearly break into hysterics in the middle of the Dane County airport giftshop. It's this cow with big saucer-dish eyes and when you squeeze it, a brown goo-like substance protrudes from its bottom. It's a pooping cow. A POOPING cow. How hilarious is that? It POOPS. hehehehe. I gave it to my dad. He laughed a little. My mom thought it was the best thing ever. Just goes to show you...when you think you know your parents, they turn around and surprise you. Anyway, The Pooping Cow needs a name. So, this is your challenge, faithful Buddha Stew enthusiasts, name the cow!!! Put those mighty brains to work. The Pooping Cow desperatedly needs a Christian (or not so much) name. Go to it!  Results will be posted as received.

      well, it's 9 am and I've been up for two and a half hours.  The paper is half done and progressing nicely (i'm just taking a little mind/breakfast break).  I intended to wake up at 8 (a little simple math here will deduce that i really woke up at 6:30...we shall continue the discussion of my awakeness in terms of what I thought at the time), did so, and promptly went back to sleep for another half hour. My bleary nearsighted eyes discerned (word of the day, i've used it about 80 times in my paper so far) that it was 8:35, so I groaned a little and wished I was still asleep, but I kicked my self-motivation sensors into gear and gave my lazy side a stern talking-to. I enjoyed the sounds of the morning for a while (i think the only reason I woke up at that point was the chirping of birds outside the window), which were very soothing with little to no people sounds whatsoever. I felt like I was at summer camp, or someplace similarily remote in which they wake you up at odd hours of the morning. Eventually (about ten minutes later) I got out of bed and showered, came back, and started wrting. I was just about finished with my second page when I looked at the clock. And blinked. I looked at a different clock. It told me the same information. And so did the clock by my bed. My estimation of the hour was somewhere around 9:30 or even ten, but it was not so. It was 7:30. As I said earlier, my limited vision told me it was later that it was...a 6 can easily be construed as an 8 when transferred to my brain by my horrible eyesight.  Nevertheless, I'm glad that I did get up, had a chance to enjoy the sounds of the morning (mind you, i wouldn't have enjoyed it so much had i not been alone--it's the same thing as that fateful beach bonfire last summer at which I spent the morning hours (from 6 to 11) camped out by a pit watching the world wake up...the best early morning experience I've ever had and it's completely mine)....and it's not even 9:30 yet. I'll be done before I know it (my break ends at 9:30, hopefully I will be entirely completed by noon).   Ah yes. I was trying to remember what made the Evening of "Pete" pop to my head, and now I do but I guess it's not really necessary anymore. Sometimes I start writing stuff ahead of time mentally, and by the time I've sat down to actually write it, only choice phrases remain, not the whole (which, no doubt, was a work of compositional genius ;). Hehe...I still enjoy the memories of that night immensely. Jason being protective (and me wishing for all the world that things were not as they indeed are..a story within itself)...Jeff the Mountaineer (from whom my waterbottle takes his name) and his giant dolphin sighting (there was also that ponderous conversation, punctuated by hand gestures-- "euphonium?" "bass trombone!")..."I think his name's 'Pete?'"..."he's too dorky to be a Mark"...all this from an evening that at first glance seemed like it was just going to be another party in which I stood in the corner and tried to look like an interesting individual. I know hardly any of this means anything to anyone but Davis...but she'll enjoy it, I'm sure. Basically it's just a chance for me to procrastinate a little more. Any interested parties who want the full story I can promise will be highly amused. It's a good story.   well, i wish i didn't have to get back to paper-writing, but i must. nose to the grindstone, back to work.

      how many mosquito bites do i have? let's count them (they are all on my legs, weird!)....one, two, three....all the way up to...fourteen. yikes! and they itch like mad. ah well.   time to get cracking on buddhism. here's the deal..i'm going to take a nap, and get started by three (3) pm. Otherwise, I'll have to kick my ass into gear. I must get this done. Once it's done...everything else is a piece of cake. So, no more flappy-flappy! i must now go into seclusion for the next twentyfour hours. i'll leave updates as things progress. don't try to call me or anything because distraction has already cost me five days of work (hehe, like i'd have done any anyway). sleep tight, ya morons.

      wooooiee. this year takes last year on the amount of crap i got kicked out of me at the annual tuba/euph-trombone softball game. not the softball. the basketball, man. three games of highly violent and extremely hilarious bball. Collin and I make a kickass team...we showed Griff and Sean a thing or two (hehe)...although later having Griffin on my team meant getting pegged in the eye once or twice (the one time i saw flashes of light just before I blacked out for the next two seconds)...basketball in the near dark is infinitely more dangerous than frisbees out of nowhere on the beach, but at least brass players know not to aim for the mouth (ahem). I had some game, I'm proud of myself. Now, gotta do it more often. The softball game was alright...IMO we were the better team, they just had the hitters. Couldn't beat us in the outfield though. I'm not sure I have the mad third base skills that apparently qualified me for the position...but ah well, didn't get much chance to make a fool of myself.   Something I love is just being out with guys and being totally aggressive and physical...just being "one of the guys." i always feel like as a girl i have to hold my own on the athletic track. It's not an excuse, just a challenge..i get a huge charge overcoming it. being so called "girly" is not my gig---although i far from claim that it's a bad thing, just that it's way more fun to play the game than to watch it. it gets into whole issues of feminism (and feminazism to coin a phrase my father uses)- whether to be feminine and proud of it or try to make being a woman more like being a guy. Honestly, I don't think the latter is the best policy, but on the other hand "feminine" has connotations of standing on the sidelines and looking pretty. I'm not pretty and I don't like watching things go on around me without my interaction. Story of my life...if i'm not involved in something i feel like it diminishes my importance. this causes trouble when things get super hectic and crazy. I'm tuning down this urge though, trying to realize that not everything needs me to contribute. It's more of a self-esteem thing than anything. me looking for my sort of spotlight which is really just a little more off to the side than in the center of everything. Not sure how much sense that makes, but oh well.   hello to hans. and yes, when i say basketball, i mean basketball...no innuendos at all mister!

      wow. i've never been at the library when it was closing. chalk it up to my list of late night college experiences that i'm slowly gaining (due to my inability to stay up and be productive past 1:30), well behind the rest of the sophomore population. hurrah. way to go lauren. nevertheless, i acheived some semblance of accomplishment and mananged to check out two more books (bringing my total to 7 books on various methods of christian and buddhist monasticism) which will probably tell me infinitely less than i need to know for my paper. hmm. alright. bedtime.

      Well, not so sick. Good! Tomorrow is the big softball game and I'm psyched...except, oh wait, I suck at softball. Oh well, it'll be a fun time. My arm is a little sore from the training sessions (ie, playing catch) of yesterday and today. Along with various other parts of my body that have been pegged by the ball...courtesy of my inability to catch things when they are hurled toward me at menacingly fast speeds.   A sad thing today: there will be no more buddhism lectures because there has been a death in my professor's family... :( i didn't go on thursday because i didn't feel well, so basically i've missed out on three days of prof dunne's infinite wisdom. he is by far one of the best teachers i've ever had. i'll have to take some more classes with him if i can.  and now...on to the paper which i probably should have begun work on much earlier, but, procrastination and i get along far too well (we've been going steady for almost 20 years) so i'll be doing it thursday night and friday morning, i'm sure. (it's due at five on friday) Off tonight to do some more research and hopefully find something that will at least get me pointed in the right direction. arrgh.   only 9 more days and everything is done...i'll be winging my way back to sunny san diego for some R&R and happy beach dwelling! hurray! if there's anything i miss, it's the beach. I just have to make it through the weekend:  Friday my paper is due, Saturday i have the water testout for the lifeguarding job i've applied for, AND my piano jury, Sunday is the music history final (and afterwards, a BBQ!) Tuesday is theory final, thursday i go home! after sunday it'll all be wonderful and stress free. i could give a crap about theory and music history should be no problem whatsoever. I think the best way to handle to stress is to look beyond it (not forget about it) and picture yourself being done with all the other crap so that you're already in that relaxed and happy mindset. Therefore, I've already turned in my buddhism paper, and actually writing it will be no sweat. Hmm. I just have to keep telling myself this. :)

      i guess i can't claim to have any sort of attractiveness to offer the opposite sex. but never mind, i can't even rant and whine here, i do it too much. needless to say, i'm lonely again and for stupid reasons but perhaps still valid, in a way. i dunno. it's time for me to sleep and hope i have a voice in the morning. g'night.

      blogger has a way of destroying the truly sublime. first, davis' brahms post, and now, my feelings about good books, one in particular. i took the time to type out a whole long quote..but now i guess you'll all have to go read the book to find out why i'm all sniffly and content this morning. (afternoon?) So, if you haven't already, take the time to read the book Watership Down, by Richard Adams.

      you know, it's ironic:  the sicker you are, the more you just want a big hug and someone to serve you chicken soup, but you're sick, so no one really wants to hug you and get sick too. this is really depressing. i'm having some of my favorite music student personal issues too, on account of my lesson earlier. i don't know if i really want to talk about them.  i think i'll go back to bed.

      it's so hot!!! arrgh. humid, mostly. what a pain in the ass. this state can't decide whether it wants to be cold or hot, but it doesn't even consider inbetween. give me good ol san diego weather, that never changes. ;)  i was thinking that i haven't sat down and written anything particularily in depth lately..mostly because of tiredness but also because not much has been going on in my head...just the usually school stress and that's boring to talk about. emotional issues have died down, which is a good thing for the time being. maybe now is a good time for that nap i meant to take yesterday.....

      all i want to do is take a nap but there is still stuff to be done! argh, life. two papers down, one to go (but it's the equivalent of two, if you consider the work that goes into researching it and the fact that it's twice as long as the other two). Two more concerts, one more recital, one initation, aaaaand...oh yeah, gotta get a job. woohooo. But...9 days and counting until finals week and then it's all over! huzzah!! i can't wait until summer. Can't. Wait. Too. Much. To. Do. musthavesummerorexplode!!!!!!!!!!! phew. that being said...i'd like to go ride my bike before the chamber orch. concert. I was supposed to go swimming, but i wimped out because I didn't feel like packing up all my shit and going. So, bike riding shall be my exercise of choice for now. schmu.

      i feel like i don't deserve to be unhappy. ever. it seems to me that every time i feel depressed everyone runs away from me. "let's give lauren some time until she feels better and then she can be happy and make us all laugh again." shitty. i really don't want to be alone!!! but i am. and i hate crying and i hate being sad but most of all i hate having one of the reasons that i stay sad longer be that everyone seems to not care. please, if you're reading this blog right now, tonight,  just give me a call.  i don't care who you are,  i'm tired of being lonely and unattractive and fucked up. tell me to snap out of it, tell me that self-pity is never worthwhile and anyway, just plan ridiculous.  please.

      must not slip into boy depression mode ("when will i stop being every guy's  girl friend  and start being some guy's  girlfriend ?") as patience is a very good virture to have, despite the fact that it is running dangerously thin. oh the torment of having your mind played with. and of course it's all your mind playing with your mind, the other person is just being himself...blah blah blah. sigh.

      argh. so far, a rotten rotten day.  it began with some ass ringing our doorbell (and really leaning on it too) at three this morning, and wanting to know if "we were all awake." ok, so that would be sort of acceptable if i didn't have to work at 6:30!! madness. Then, Nate didn't show up for work so I was all by myself and I had to try to keep myself awake by means OTHER than scratching all my mosquitos. So I wrote notes to the other guards and drew pictures in the book. Sigh.  And, like all unlucky days, today I seem to have trouble with inanimate objects, the most recent example being a poster i am trying to put up, but on account of me being too short and it not cooperating, it is very frustrating. I suck at trombone, I have $6.52 to my name, and I have to go deal with my 5 year old cousin tonight instead of drinking away my frustrations. ARGH. hehe.. Ok, I feel better. Venting is wonderful. vent vent vent.

      ok, so i just spent waaaay too much money on cds but it's okay, they were all worthwhile buys and I am happy. Here's what I got:  Christain Lindberg, Romantic and Burlesque Tbone cds (actually they came as a set, and only for $15!) Mussorgsky, Pictures at an Exhibition (wonderful wondeful listening to it right now) De Meij (i am now officially obsessing over mr. johann de meij), Lord of the Rings (too wonderful even for words like wonderful)  So all in all it's great:  that averages out to about $10 a cd, which is a steal. Still, i'm not sure if I was at liberty to spend that forty dollars. ah well.   I have a ridiculously swollen mosquito bite on my leg and it's driving me crazy because I haven't itched it at all!!! ARGH! I hate mosquitos. Hate hate hate.   Well, I'm sure after such a dry spell of emotional lauren distress, you are all expecting something great and earth-shattering, or, for those of you who are wise, you are wondering when next I shall babble about my fucked-up non-relationship with Ryan. But HA! I actually haven't got anything interesting or even remotely depressing or deep to say. Things are calm, too calm...(slow, evil-sounding note from the string basses) ah well...we shall see what roads this weekend shall lead me upon.

      I am alive!! Today I biked 17 miles. This is what Hot Eric from Olbrich Beach told me. Of course, my use of the term "hot" reminds me of how disgusted I was with the little day campers at the beach...i was in the bathroom at the same time as a bunch of them and the bulk of their conversation was "who's pretty and who's ugly" so me using "hot" feels a little hypocritical but at the same time an entirely accurate description. Kids are so mean sometimes. Especially at that age, pre-preteen. Ah well, I am a little sunburnt and not a little bit tired. So maybe a nap is in order, and then practice, and tomorrow is another beautiful day, I hope!

      Alex made it home today. Davis is happy! :) We went to lunch and then saw Shrek. Good times, good times!! I borrowed a CD from Collin that has the DeMeij Tbone Concerto on it, hurray! It is, of course, awesome, and I am burning as we speak. Saturday is Collin and his roomie Greg's bday (21!!!--even though he doesn't drink, he still plans on going to bars), and it is also Rhythm and Booms, so he is going to call me if they do anything. Hurray again! What a sweetheart. He forgot the cd so I walked back to his place to pick it up, and then he walked (with his bike) back to Humanities with me.   Tomorrow I am nervous for. I start working the beaches...but the trick is, I have to ride my bike all the way around Monona in my schedule of relief guarding. So basically, I get to bike at least fifteen miles tomorrow, total. Fifteen! I am nervous because 1) I do not have any of my equipment; suit, shorts, shirt, etc, 2)I'm afraid I'll get lost and be late, and 3)I don't know everything that needs to be done but it seems like they expect you too. Still, it is my first day, and hopefully they will be lenient with me. Ah well...we'll see. Everything, as usual, will be okay.   I ran into Mr. Cynical again today. Remember the "UC Davis? That sucks!" man? Yes, the very same. This time I was with Alex and Davis. And he says, "You sickass Americans! Europe's running circles around you!" What the hell is that supposed to mean? Alex took a doubletake and we all gave him confused looks because I can't imagine what we looked/dressed like to deserve that comment, and of course, we still have no clue what he meant. Next time I see Mr. Cynical I am going to ask him why he is so mad at the world. He makes me sad.   Ah well, must wait for DeMeij to finish loading and doing so by enjoying the Kodaly Sonata for Unaccompanied Cello. I have said this many times, but when I get a dog, I am going to name him Zoltan Kodaly. I am sort of thinking about getting a snake. It will be named Prokofiev. (This is where you shout, "Music dork, music dork!!") We shall see.

      blogspot is being goofy, my apologies even though i can't really do anything about it. it seems to work sort of alright on explorer though. Anyhoo, aujourd'hui ce n'est pas nouveau, parce que je n'ai pas faire rien mais jouer de trombon et manger.  Ah, oui, c'est vrai que j'ai lu mon livre pour une heure. Mais, c'est tout. Qu'est-ce qu'il y a personne qui espere aller a bicyclete avec moi? Je vais aller avec Bethany apres une demi-heure. Compredez-vous? Mauvais francais, je sais! Desolee!

      What a wonderful evening! (this typed at exactly the same moment Davis says, behind me, "what a disappointing day" so i guess this means my level of excitement is not communicated to the people around me...well, i know why she said it and i must say, cheer up, lass, it'll all come round in the end, eh? *said in a cockney accent*) I just saw  Moulin Rouge  which I thought was AMAZING and wonderful and not just because I am a total Paris freak. And now I have just found out (via Hans) that Ewan McGregor did all his own singing which totally makes me looooove him even more. Aw, Ewan. Marvelous, marvelous, marvelous. It has me all worked up now and Davis and Bethany are not (I believe B went to bed) so I must run around and talk nonsense into fans all by myself. And sing, "Roxanne" and other such hits from the picture. I guess at heart I will always remain a Bohemian Hopeless Romantic who loves musicals.  The other best part of tonight is that I got made fun of for once having been romantically attached to Dave Lanni and the thing is, it was perfect! I totally deserved it. Go Jessie. Your rock. It was out of the blue and I laughed out loud. Tears came to my eyes, I swear it. So, Hurray! Go see Moulin Rouge, and laugh, and love the world!

      I have used Buddha Stew to brighten someone's day! (ben)  Training for beach lifeguard today...uck...lots and lots of weeds in lake monona. not so hot to swim in. but alright...i have one permanent spot on tuesdays and now i can pick up sub hours. It seems like a lot of requirements for being on time and setting things up and so on...but it should be fun and i get to spend the rest of the summer enjoying the outside! I will let you know when I am close to town and y'all can come visit me. :)  Sad news though, I got my mouthpiece and it's too large a shank. I shall have to send it back. :( Ah well, I have procrastinated ordering it long enough, and I can wait a little while longer.  Back to the old Bach 5G for a while yet! It has served me well at least. Lots of new music though, including a Lindberg CD that I am listening to currently. It's got the Sulek and Hindemith, and Blue Bells (haha!), and Sequenza V. So it rocks, basically. A new method book also came...which will be good for my tired out old warmup. Time to start cracking on practicing!  Of course, yesterday only the first day of summer officially. I have been enjoying summer for quite some time and I shall continue to do so. At work this morning it was just Nate and I, and very busy. But it was alright. At least you have someone to talk to and there is less falling asleep involved. :) Alright...I really really deserve a shower right now. The Lake-Itchiness has gone on long enough.

      the first day of summer and here's how it was spent for Lauren:  Woke up around 9:40, meaning to get up with my alarm half an hour earlier so I would have time to shower and eat breakfast before practice/work, but only managed the breakfast. Getting up was HARD. Anyway, went to practice but didn't get anything accomplished for various reasons but mostly that I was just fed up with my regular warmup and didn't have the presence of mind at the moment to change it so i quit and took a nap in the lounge until it was time to ride to work. Work, slow...weird, but tolerable. Home, totally needing an increase in bloodsugar...when i got home I had to sit down to stop the room from spinning...went to Noodles with Bethany, Davis, and Chris. After that (and feeling much better and not shaky or queasy at all thanks much!) Chris and I went to the zoo. He saw the live badger that he so desperately wanted to see, and I got to make various and probably very obnoxious comments comparing everything to the San Diego Zoo. Biked through the Arboretum...I fell off my bike! Hurray for me! It was one of those stupid things you do while it's going through your head, "hey, dumbass, you're going to fall off your bike if you do this, so why don't you not do it?" but I went ahead and hit that curb anyway, top speed and on a tilt. Hmm. What else? Practiced...and saw Collin! Yay! He is such a happy, fun person. He yelled, "Lauren!!" and gave me a hug. I felt highly loved. And then walked home with Davis babbling about how I love people and they are so crazy and funny and I just can't express in words how much people make me happy sometimes. I don't know.. as a society we do everything wrong, yet people like Collin can always restore my faith in individuals and I hope I never lose that. I hope I can always be happy about people and their silliness and enjoy who they are. And that ends today...and now it's time for summer!  Mwah!

      interesting conversation about lettuce at work today with nate. we were trying to figure out if it's a flower or a leaf, and ultimately came to the conclusion (sitting on a guard stand for twenty minutes will give you time to think) that it is a leaf because it is green and therefore produces chlorophyll. hehe. i just liked the way he said, "you know, now I'm confused, but I'm thinking about lettuce. When you eat lettuce, are you eating a flower?"  hmm...not much to say. perhaps then, i shouldn't say it. :)

      Lauren's Top 4* Things Overheard This Summer:   4)In a parking lot, said as someone walked by a car bearing this bumpersticker:  "Love me, love, my goats" 3)Heard on State Street: "Oh, my god, what a frrrreeeak!" 2)Tired mom at the San Diego Zoo: "Alright. Let's do Africa." and the number one thing overheard all summer (drumroll, please...) is.... 1)On classical radio, said by a melodious dj voice (male): "Anton Dvorak must have been a great lover...of nature." *List to be expanded as summer progresses  thank you, thank you, I'll be here all week. Say hi to the bartender, he's a personal friend of mine. Thanks again folks, you've been a great crowd.

      just thought you'd like to know, but I am dancing about conducting Tchaik 4 with a spoon and alternately eating lemon yogurt with same. Hot damn, I love Tchaikovsky.   My best friend from middle school just emailed me. She used to live across the street and moved away in 7th grade to Memphis....I haven't talked to her in something like 6 years. She sounds good...I missed seeing her at home, she came to visit two days after I returned to madison. grr.   By the way, some weird grammatical fairy has taken me over and made me start capitalizing things again. Hmm...I think it is getting harder for me to break rules I learned in grade school the older I get. For a while there I was on a stream of rule-breaking, and know I am right back to capitalizing my "I's" and beginnings of sentences. No one will ever get me to stop using comma splices, and runon sentences, though, never!! Ah-hahahahaha!!! Foolish Mortals.

      God only knows why, but I am in the greatest mood today. No real reason...I mean, I had to wake up at quarter to 6 this morning and that's not the greatest...but I woke up with "867-5309" stuck in my head and ever since I've been crazy giddy. Actually, most of it is post-early morning nap, as after guarding I was so tired I could barely stay on my bike.  I fell into the deepest sleep...and I had a dream that Abby was trying to rearrange all the furniture in our living room, and I was trying to stop her but I was late for work and couldn't do much. This has to mean something...Arwen at work suggested that maybe people are trying to change things in my life (rearranging furniture) but I don't have time for it, because I have other things on my agenda. Hmm...it sounds nice. I haven't decided if it's entirely revelant and especially with Abby because I don't think she's trying to rearrange my life...  Anyhoo...Davis' blog seems to be suggesting that I rant and rave about "My Night With Bluebottle" so I'll do a little. First of all, I had a grrreat time. They are seven hilarious boys and I enjoyed myself completely. I spent most of the time talking to Dave and Brandon...well, let me put that another way:  Brandon spent a lot of time talking to me, and Dave mostly made my feet fall asleep because he kept sitting on them. Go fig. Anyhoo, everyone imbibed a lot of alcohol, in fact, ALL of the alcohol we possess, so it was a raucous ruckus all around. I was only half aware of what Davis was up to...and what transpired with Steve is out of my field of vision (although she has since told me), although it is all good. I hope. Maybe I was just too caught up in the whole "This chick is soo cool! I've talked jazz, horns, and lots of shit with her and she rocks! Yeah, I bet...blah blah blah" Brandon thing, I got a kick out of that kid. He talks a lot. ;) People piles on the couch were highly prevalent, and the mayhem didn't die out until after 5 in the morning. Brandon broke my clock...the second hand fell off and it's stuck at 4:25...so at least we know the exact time at which it was broken! Hehe...that's alright, I don't really need another clock. My life is governed by time enough as it is.  Mass hangovers in the morning...I got up at 9:30 and had to wait until noon for the boys to start stirring. Dave was the last one up and the last one out the door, at 2:30 or so. All in all, a good time. A good distraction from thinking, of which I have been doing too much (and i have been thinking without using much common sense, which is a bad thing).  Anyway, my good mood continues...perhaps this bodes well for a productive practice session. But first, lunch!

      a thunderstorm! the best...for the second time in a week i've gotten trapped away from home/work without a jacket or umbrella. but this wasn't as bad as my  bike riding thunderstorm adventure. this was more of a drizzle. the lightning though, is amazing. makes me feel very introspective and philosophical. i think i shall go sit on the stoop and be so, while watching the storm.

      ahh....stupid blogger. well, all my long rant about last night disappeared TWICE and I don't feel like rewriting it for a third time. Needless to say, a good time was had by all. A little advancement in the self-image/presenting an effective personality department was made. Actually a pretty good-sized advancement, that comes in two parts. Most of it has already been written down...by hand, in a safe, secret place (ha ha! i have fooled you, loyal blog readers!) which shall not be revealed at this time. Anyhoo, fun times.   And now, a quote that will make you think about me even more!  "Introverted iNtuiting Feeling Judging (INFJs) personalities are deeply concerned about their relations with individuals, as well as the state of humanity at large. They are, in fact, sometimes mistaken for extroverts because they appear so outgoing and are so genuinely interested in people--a product of the Feeling function they most readily show to the world. On the contrary, INFJs are true introverts, who can only be emotionally intimate and fulfilled with a chosen few from among their long-term friends, family, or obvious "soul mates" [grr].  While instinctively courting the personal and organizational demands continually made upon them by others, at intervals INFJs will suddenly withdraw into themselves, sometimes shutting out even their intimates.  This apparent paradox is a necessary escape valve for them, providing both time to rebuild their depleted resources and a filter to prevent the emotional overload to which they are so susceptible as inherent "givers." As a pattern of behavior, it is perhaps the most confusing aspect of the enigmatic INFJ character to outsiders, and hence the most often misunderstood--particularily by those who have little experience with this rare type."  And more:  "Their combination of empathy and strong verbal skills [hmm..not so sure that applies to me] make them natural writers, especially of fiction or of non-fiction requiring a restrained emotional tone.  (I think Kiersey tages INFJ as "The Writer")  "INFJs tend to question and examine their own motivations constantly.  In moderation this is admirable, but some go so far as to decide that any "selfishness" (which often translates to taking care of themselves instead of others, for once) in their desires is completely unacceptable.  Needless to say, this can cause a great deal of stress for the INFJ in question, which they sometimes resolve in a rather  convoluted manner: by deriving a Higher Principle from the "selfish" need."  So I am tagged by the Kiersey personality test. There is more; interesting but not so relevant. I dunno...I think it fits, as doubtful as I normally am about "personality" tests. Of course, in my endless quest for knowledge about this world and my reactions to it, I am always interested in someone's interpretation of my point of view. The part that really makes me happy is the sentence that ends "this rare type" mostly for selfish reasons (and yes, i quarreled with myself about whether or not I should write this thought) because it means I have some sort of individuality or specialness in relationship to others. hmm. Still, the first paragraph is the most true. Well having, in so many words, gone against my natural tendency to not talk about myself (sarcasm!), it is time for dinner and getting out into the world (sincei have spent all of the day, sadly, inside thinking complicated thoughts that have not yet been solved)...and here i go.

      wishing that i didn't have to speak in riddles.   bethany and i went out to picnic point via bicycle today...gorgeous today! the water beckoned me to kayak upon it, so we are going to look into rental of such. also into having a picnic/campfire at the point, since that's what it appears to be there for. ;)   you know...this whole thing has gone on way to long. i must put a stop to it. say farewell, cincinnatus, you are now being retired and you may no longer muck about and cause emotional setbacks in my stream of consciousness. shaky steps forward...and i wish myself, as megan would, luck-luck!

      i did call. left a message. usually he's pretty good about calling back, we'll see.   i'm starting to get that sensation in my tummy, the one that tells me that, oh, yeah...this whole relationship thing (meaning, the concept) is just way out of my control. i mean, i don't know what to think. i'm not talking about ryan really, just generally. i can't keep a grip on what i think is the right path and what the rest of me really wants to do because of desire/personalhappiness/wantingtodowhatwillmakeothersfeelgood...etc.  i don't understand why i must make things awkward-in my head. it's all in my head, dammit!  what the hell am i talking about? see what i mean? i go insane every time i have to think about potential relationships. fuck fuck fuck.

      hehe. today...today is nothing new, really. one of the guys at the pool forgot to unlock the women's locker room so i was locked out of work for about ten minutes, until they figured it out.  boys! oh well, as a consolation i only had to sit ten minutes on the stand for the first rotation. bonus.  by the way...seeing mikey and chris on wednesday was awesome. its too bad they don't have very many free days. they are two people i'd like to see more than once and a while.  speaking of which...let's have a poll. should i, or should i not, call ryan tonight? or at all? i have a feeling i will. just because.

      crazy weather today, and me stuck in the middle of it! i was at humanitites and it started to absolutely pour and thunder and lightning.....and i had to get to work on my bicycle! so i braved it, and got soaked through. hurray for white tshirts. ah well..it was an experience. otherwise, nothing interesting. it's almost the weekend! time for a break and going out at night. only work once tomorrow, which is nice...that pool is so warm! the high chair is like a sauna. yeegch. but that's alright. i worked with matt and nate this morning, and nate and nick and ryan this afternoon. matt is hilarious. he was going off about this one dude's speedo...it was huge, and bright green, and he had a lot to say about it. hehe. sort of had to be there, but it was funny, funny, funny.  well, laundry awaits.

      alright..sorry for a small delay in blogging. things have been busy! I started work at the uw natatorium, which so far has beena lot of fun! the other lifeguards are  tres  cool. one of them, Arwen (her name rocks! it's from Lord of the Rings) is from Poway! she knows Joey Brennan. wow! we were both stunned that we came from the same place to...wisconsin.  anyway, i guarded this morning starting at 6:30...argh. a little tough getting up but once i was outside, i was blessed with some pretty pretty things to see. the lake was still, no waves. it was gorgeous. and it wasn't yet sticky and 90 out. so that's a bonus. i don't know if i can do that often though..i like my late nights too much.  Jon is coming up! first weekend or so in july. we're going to ravinia to see shostie 5 and i believe the tchaik violin concert as well. so we can have a good time and party and see/hear (depending on where we end up sitting) classical music. huzzah!  alright...time for a little lunch, and then, off to see madison scouts play at the capital. hurray! mikey! hurray! chris!

      hallo all.  hurray! people are back in town and now the summer really gets started. my lips are starting to function normally in relation to my trombone playing, the weather's been nice (although interesting..it randomly started pouring yesterday evening after a pretty sunny day).  and so on! hoping that the forthcoming trip to ravinia will become a reality...shostakovich 5!!! and jon visiting. fun fun! still don't know what's going on with my jobs. bleh. and i'm having trouble deciding if i should call ryan or let him call me. i have a feeling that if do the latter, it'll never happen but if i do the former i'll end up bitching at him and alienating him more. what to do? well, i should let bethany use the internet. crises resolved daily, will keep updated.

      Interesting and entertaining evening yesterday. Ben called up and wanted to go to a chamber concert, which we did, and it was very cool. Then we recklessly rode our bikes around Madison until we ended up at the Nottingham Co-op, which proved to be a very educational place for me to be. I met some pretty neet people. Allyson(sp?) had just come back from Nepal and brought her pictures...which were awesome, and made me want to go even more. Alas, need money for such things. Anyway, came home, went to bed (very tired and developing headache. bleh). woke up to phone call this morning at 8 am, but didn't answer it, as i thought that anyone who calls at 8 on a saturday morning doesn't deserve to be answered. upon falling back asleep i had the most disturbing dream:  i was still in sd and supposed to take abby to the airport but was watching tv and didn't notice that she had left...and then katie came over with this doll that was created in her likeness, it was supposed to be her guardian angel or something. Anyway, I think Jon was there somewhere too but he was more of a presence and less a character in the dream. So, I finally realized that Abby was gone so I asked my mom where she went, and she said my dad had taken her to the airport. I asked why? i was supposed to take her. And she glares at me and starts telling me that i never pay attention and that everytime she's doing work do i ask to help? no, i just go blithely about my business and no wonder abby left without you, you don't care enough to help people out and on and on...i woke up in a very disturbed cold sweat...  anyway, davis and bethany come back today. or tomorrow morning. i hope it's today. i just got a call from a guy named jim who needs me to lifeguard for him next saturday, and he was pretty entertaining. he sounded like the traditional "surfer:" uh, hi this jim, from beaches? i was wondering, uh, if you could, uh, sub for me next saturday? when i told him i would get back to him, as i am not yet sure of my job status within the city beaches community, he said, oh, dude, ok, just uh, give me a call back. thanks. hehe. i believe bridget jones would term jim a "grunge youth" which seems to fit in this case. anyway, must find something to do for the rest of to-day. hmm.

      hurray! i have two jobs now. and a gig. hurray! i love being back in madison..things don't seem so disconnected. i guess that would mean that the majority of my life is at college..and of course that's true. still, i'm glad. i could only do so much from home, and now, not having been back in wisconsin for more than 15 hours, i've already gotten a job and practiced and given my accompanist my address so he can bill me (hmm..maybe not so happy). well, happy anyway. and now i can listen to the OBC recording of On the Town and study up the trombone parts. :) Just waiting now for the horn cats to get back so the summer can really get started. i'm on my own for tonight and tomorrow. but that's alright...plenty of chores to do (argh).

      back in mad-town! goodness..this house is a mess of dust and moving in junk. I shall have to work on that this afternoon. I have another lifeguard test, at the SERF at 12:45. I guess since I already passed one lifeguard test (no matter how poorly) I'm not so nervous about this one. What I'm more nervous about is going to humanities (which I will in a sec) and pulling out my trombone for the first time in three weeks. eek. wish me luck!

      rooting through my closet today i found some old papers from band leadership camp:  my kiersey personality test thing. hmm. neat. i've always been rather attracted to these type of tests. some would say it's a security thing, i need someone else to tell me who i am or something, but i think i just like confirming what i already know. this one's pretty accurate. it says i'm a INFJ:  an Introverted iNtuitive Feeling Judging personality. apparently we INFJs are very rare. hm. neet. i recall being the only one in the leadership, and that i was very closely related to jeff...which i thought was ironic but perhaps not so surprising. well, i won't bore y'all with the details. just thought it was interesting. well...time for supper.

      yes i am still bored. but here i am again! post post post, what a busy little beaver i! i was just rifling through davis' archives. reading some old stuff (but mostly looking for posts about me because i am the shit you know...hmm, not so much) and pondering and i started thinking about chris and mikey and how they are cool people. so, wherever you two crazy scouts kids are tonight, i'm thinking about ya.  i have managed to avoid the cookies. this is good. my mom made me tea, though, so i'm still feeling that "i've taken in too much sustenance" sort of bloatedness. mm. pleasant, i know.  a small annoyance: disneyland now costs $43. what up, fool? that's ridiculously expensive for a park that probably makes more money than the US can produce in ten years. i don't care about the damn energy crisis! they can handle it! it's  disney  for the love of buddha! so katie wants me to look into getting up to magic mountain...which costs the same but there might be a discount. now, the last time i tried to convince my parents to let me go to mm they turned me down because it's practically in thousand oaks and my dad has enough trouble with me just going to anaheim. humph. whatever happened to disney's southern california days? you used to be able to get into disneyland for $21 if you lived in s.ca. arhahahrhghaagha. that's the noise i made when i saw the price. i was on the phone with katie too and she wasn't impressed (now..i'd definitely be impressed if someone said "arhahahrghaagha" to me on a phone). my mom and i are going to see bridget jones's diary tomorrow in the the-a-tre. hurray! i've been wanting to see it.  hmm...typing without caps is a wonderful thing.  it's my goal to get my blog up on the list of the 'ten most recently updated blogs' on the blogger website. i don't know why, i know it's a shitty goal but i'm so crazy bored i need something to do. so immediately after i press post and publish i'm running (figuratively) on over to blogger to see if i'm famous yet. i mean, i go click on those random blogs all the time just to compare and contrast. like the competitive weirdo i am.  i will be very happy to see davis and bethany again. i'm wondering (outloud, in case anyone cares to answer me) when they'll get back from the horn thing in michigan. i'm also pumped to start my job. i think it'll be good for me. i mean, look at this way:  i have to be alert, confident, and i have to ride my bike to get there and do these things. (i'm obsessed with this bike riding thing, i know...but it all comes from the spell my beautiful blue bianchi bike has set upon me) so i'll get exercise and become a more aware individual. maybe. this is all just me bsing because i don't want to go find another book to read and feel like a vegetable for another two hours. bullshit bullshit bullshit. fun fun fun. i'm laughing at myself right now because i've written an obsessive amount of blogs that are basically ramblings about nothing in particular (and all very similar nothings, at that) which all my friends who are currently in sunny spain will have to catch up on when they get back. haha! i'm so evil.  speaking of evil, the man who does the voice of kronk in the emperor's new groove appeared in the episode of news radio that i happened to be watching today. kronk is my favorite character from that movie because...well, he can talk to squirrels. anyway, the episode was all about him being evil and there were some very funny cracks. the evilness is also ironic because dave foley is in news radio and he also does the character of heckubus(sp?) in kids in the hall, and he is very evil. eh, eh? see the connection. oooh i'm so terribly bored. look at me babble like a lunatic about sitcoms and sketch comedy. huzzah, huzzah! babbling is good for the soul, i've always told myself (more of a self-calming technique). back to the original topic of this paragraph, i simply must purchase emperor on video cassette because that movie whoops so much winamp ass (so there, winamp!). if this is not making any sense to anyone, then how about this:  woieighibodki wiw gohohopd. woijd wiognkdl k dkdigo. hjfirohp fkfl dliwogn alksodi g kls lwiwog.  in typing class (ironically the second reference i've made to that stupid class in two days) my favorite mindless exercise was this one:  asdfjkl; ;lkjfdsa asdfjkl; ;lkjfdsa asdfjkl; ;lkjfdsa if you could give a definition to the word qwertyuiop, what would it be? how about poiuytrewq? qwertyuiop looks like some sort of sea creature, perhaps a new variant of polyp. and poiuytrewq is a new scientific device that stabilizes atoms. or it's a new type of space exploring mechanizism. you know, "the revolutionary space pod POIUYTREWQ landed on venus today and send back breathtaking pictures of what scientists are calling 'qwertyuiops' because of their uncanny resemblance to earth's own polyp family. no word yet has come back on whether or not the pod will be returning to earth or continuing on to venus' neighboring planet, mercury, for a look at the hot deserts of this solar system's first planet. in other science related news..." hmm...that was..interesting. you know what i'd like to do? start up a joint blog that acts like one of those games we used to play in eighth grade with our vocabulary words. you know, each person has a word they have to use in a sentence, but that sentence has to be part of a story too. hence something like this: Once, a  loquacious  mole named gunther was travelling to see his niece, barbarella. he was unaware, however, of a major  subterfuge  that was being plotted against him in an attempt to steal his neat root collection. while he was on the road to barbarella's spiffy uptown tree pad, he came across a  ubiquitous  snake with fierce emerald eyes and a charming hiss in his throat. gunther was not alarmed, though, as he had often come across such an  aberration  in normal forest procedures before... and so on. only, you wouldn't have to do it with vocab words, just each person adding a new and unique sentence or paragraph or whatnot. sound cool? hmm. i don't think i can top that, so i'm going to go read some more. and no cookies! arhahahrghaagha.

      bored bored bored  i must say, i was terribly disappointed in the sketch comedy proferred to me this afternoon by comedy central. it was very weak. saturday night live failed to stimulate. and kids in the hall only made me laugh out loud once. now...that's a sad episode of kids. i suppose this wouldn't have been so disappointing if it hadn't been the only thing i'd done all day. but it is and it was. sigh. my mom brought home price club cookies, and now i'm just going to spend the rest of the evening in this cookie-induced stupor that i am powerless to prevent. damn cookies. ah well.

      well! i do my best work by accident, i suppose. i was getting set to change the colors around and try a sort of pink-on-white thing, but i guess i forgot to change the vertical bar from black to white, and  voila!   a masterpiece. the title is more centered over the bar too, which improves aesthetics. go me! it would be awesome if i could figure out a way to upload a little picture of a buddha for the title. hmm. next on the list.  as for doing nothing to-day, it's a little stale. i need some excitement. it's sunny outside. i feel like riding a bike or going roller blading. perhaps i'll take mr. chip's lazy ass for a walk.

      marvelous news for all CAKE fans: the first single from their new album will be released for your radio pleasure on June 12th. Huzzah! That means the album and the tour are not far behind.   well, I think I'm done mucking with the colors. Maybe not. Probably, though, because it's the sort of thing I can only do in short bursts, and now I'll leave the scheme alone for another month or so. Then I'll figure out how to do something else to make it spiffy. It must be taken a step at a time.   What to do today? It feels like a good day to sit around and read a book. Just so.

On the Town has started, and so far it's been a fun time.  the music is pretty fun to play.  the singing is okay..the leads are pretty good, but they can never live up to the leads i have in my head (frank!) so that's a little disappointing but ah well, that's the way life goes.   other than all this musical stuff i have nothing to talk about. i'm sick of analyzing ryan, i'm sick of telling stupid stories about what happened at work, i'm sick of riding my bike and being in a swim suit twentyfourseven (ironic i should say that as i am considering going swimming right now).  In other words I've reached that point in the summer where if school started in two weeks I wouldn't be upset about it. I'd secretly be excited while on the outside dutifully pursuing an attitude of annoyance.    Somewhere in the time I have left of summer, however, I'm going home, which will maybe spice things up for a little while. It's due...I miss San Diego and friends there. I should be home for Natalie's birthday...so maybe something exciting will happen around that. Surely she'll have a celebration of some sort! Also Marisa will be home, and I haven't seen her for at least a year! Maybe Megan too will magically appear and we can all go to the HCW pool and sit in the spa and recount all our college adventures (of which I have very few to offer that would translate well outside of present experience). If not, sigh. I will come back and practice like mad, have my audition, and start school again.  welcome, i say.

      I know my last blog says life is wonderful, but right now, life is terrible. I just want to yell at someone.  Inanimate objects (at which I have been yelling at already) just aren't doing it. I really want to yell at Ryan.  But anyone will do. It's nothing personal. I know, I'm trying to NOT be angry because I hate it when other people lose their tempers but this whole week has just been miserable and I'm fed up.  I've fallen off my fucking bike twice already, skinned both knees, the chain slipped both times...i feel like a complete numbskull at work...i'm a romantic pariah....dammit...this isn't how you're supposed to spend the first week of your twenties.  dammit.

      alllllright. life is wonderful, for i now possess all four CAKE cds. and the new one, so far (8 songs in) is maaaaarrvelous! hurray for CAKE. they are on the late late show tonight but beatriz is asleep on the couch. :(  i worked a long and hectic day today, and i am surprisingly not more tired! actually i have a lot of energy, which is weird for a tuesday night...ah, maybe not so weird. oh well. still, i should get a reasonable amount of sleep as tomorrow is *zzzzzz* my SERF day. argh. oh well.  jason is having another party but i don't have quite enough energy to work my way over there. sigh! bedtime.

      ok. i still don't think i feel like writing much. but, needless to say, I had a good party. the day after was a little shaky, but saturday was a good day. yah. well, you'll get more later. or you can go to davis' page (see links on left) and get a different perspective on the day.  i have a lot regarding ryan on my mind...bad. but i shall explain it someday soon, when hopefully i'm not grumpy and don't have a headache. yah...just so.

      Yeah, I've been sort of pitiful about posting for the past two days.  I'm gearing up for the big day--but at the same time I feel a little foolish. I always get this way. I give myself so many conflicting streams of thought that I end up just feeling lost in my own head.  I love my birthday, and I feel that birthdays should always be celebrated with parties and happiness, but at the same time I wonder that I'm not really annoying some people by going on and on about it, and then I get into that section of feelings dedicated to blueness and semi-unhappiness. Hmm...Ah well. It's my one day of the year. Might as well use it.   It's very hot and ucky. I need to go out and put up posters for the Russian Folk Orchestra thing, but I'm a little T.O.ed at Victor for thinking this all needs to be done three weeks in advance. Everytime I see him it's "Well, Lllauren (victor does this cool L rolling thing), I am getting little nervous for the concert, you see, we onllly have thrree weeks. and people want to know in advance, so if you could just do this..." (not at all representative of russian accent, but in my head it works).  And it's annoying because 1) I have to work when the stores are open 2) It's always hot 3) I'm tired 4) I want to take a nap.  hehehe....the last three are my lame excuses and the first one isn't even true because I have that whole window of time between 1 and 4 to go out and be productive. Ah well,  Here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to sleep until 3, and then go do posters, and then go to work. sounds good, eh? oh yeah..somewhere in there I will make a walgreen's/cat's meow stop, to purchase some fun for tomorrow night....heheheh

      argh! my archives have, once again, disappeared. I mean, beyond even reposting, they are just gone! arrrrrrrrghahghaghahga!  today is, already, becoming one of those days where i can't handle anything. Even walking is kind of annoying. I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that my throat is full of crap and the rest of my body isn't quite in top form either. It's pissing me off. I couldn't practice for more than twenty minutes because i could get a deep enough breath to even finish warming up. I thought today was going to be cool because I woke up to thunderstorms...and that means no work! but the storms have stopped and now it is sunny and humid. fuckers. i need a nap.

      Well, today I have proceeded to prove, once again, that I am a complete incompetent failure at dealing with unfamiliar social situations. (so incompetent that i even managed to spell "incompetent" wrong the first time I typed it)  Here I was going to put a rant about my SERF incident, but before I could write anything I dropped a bunch of cheesy noodles on my keyboard, proving that I am not only incompetent, but a dork and a klutz as well.  Anyway, I had a lot more speculations to put here...about why I feel like a dumbass...perhaps delve into the reasons behind it, but all my good and reasonable thoughts have been lost on the bike ride from the SERF to here, at my computer desk. I am wondering when I will learn, 4 days from being 20, how to deal with myself and others effectively. I think it is incredibly ironic (but perhaps not too much so) that my desire to communicate and be liked by most people is shot to shit by my obvious inability to even have words come out of my mouth in a clear and concise fashion.   At any rate, a good deal of my antics today may have been the fault of being a tad hungover, as hanging out at Jason's last night was a little too much fun.  But fun nevertheless, and part of my self-awareness realization for today is that although I'd like to know and be friendly with most everyone, there are certain people that are perfect for me, because they make me happy and I don't have to stress out when talking to them.  So I must let go of my desire to be 'everything to everyone' and be content with being myself to my friends. :)

      Hurray! I had a good time last night. Brandon, as always, was in top form (slightly tipsy and very amusing) and said he'd try to make it to the Wes and Lauren Bday Extravaganza.  He's become a vegetarian until August on a bet from one of his friends, so he made veggie shishkabobs for him and Davis that turned out sort of interesting, I guess. ("I've had too many...vegetables!") The brats (cooked in the dark) were also interesting. Very crispy on one side, near to uncooked on the other. And kind of spicy, as I suspect they were actually Italian sausages and not bratwurst.  I learned the fingerings (well, a good majority of) for euphonium and it was fun! I should play it more often.   Well, speaking of which I thought it might be nice to get up and practice before work (12:15) today, but I'm too lazy! I'd rather sit around in my pjs. And that means I probably won't practice at all today (get off work at 8), so, bad Lauren. Ah well. That's what sucks about rotating work schedules...I don't have time to get into a groove.  I had a little groove going for a while, but then the Nat closed (alas!) so it's all off again. Argh. well, best go get ready for...something...uh, yeah.

      Well, this is shaping up to be a good weekend!!! Last night's show was awesome...with the exception of our answering machine freaking out which resulted in B and I not getting in touch with Davis. We did try, hon!!! But it was awesome to see the boys...Mike's solo sounded great (sufficient mojo), Chris is way skinnier (not so hot as he was sick last week), but good. They both promised to call me on my bday *hurray* and so I'm looking forward to that.   Tonight!! Tonight Grant is driving us to Oconomowoc (say that three times fast, Jon!) to see Brandon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yay! He is having a party at his "incredifuckingly" nice house. Brandon! yay! Brandon is one of those people that makes me happy just because he's part of the world, and more importantly, my world. So needless to say, I'm excited to go.  Tomorrow I work all day! At BB Clarke, and Ryan said he would come visit. I get to work with Mark, too, from the Nat, and prove to him that I am not "quiet and innocent" as he seems to believe. Speaking of which, the Nat is now closed! *sob!* Ah well...this coming Tuesday night is actually supposed to work out for Pat McCurdy, so *fingers crossed* hopefully I will get to go out with  the other guards.    Well, I think I am using far too many !!!s today so i shall go take my exuberance out into the world and share.

      ah davis..there is so much sadness in the world, and we all own our fair chunk of it. sometimes if you want someone to listen you have to ask them to. (i think you told me that) i think everyone is a little down right now..midsummer blues or something. i got a birthday package from my mummy today, and it made me cry for lots of reasons. Most of all because I miss my parents sometimes more than I care to admit, and also because it's my birthday  soon .  I love birthdays, and especially my own.  It's the luckiest birthday of the year!! (7/21) and it mathemathically works into itself:  7x3 ((2+1)) =21.  I think I lead a bit of a charmed existence...so whenever I feel down I look at what makes me happy (my bday) and say, things will always get better.  The other thing about my birthday:  it's the one day of the year that's reserved entirely for myself. As a recovering shy person I think I still have issues (both timid-related and for unselfish reasons) being the center of attention.  But on July 21st people are supposed to pay attention to me! it's the law. It's wonderful. Birthdays are awesome. I wish I could spend it with everyone:  family, friends from home, college friends....but nevertheless it'll be fun. Only 10 more days! I go crazy about birthdays...but I definitely think it's worth it. :)

      well, i've reached one of those stages you hit (or maybe just me) every once in a while where everything just seems a little silly and petty. and you want out. so you drive everyone else around you insane by being crabby and unhappy and pretty soon you get left alone to be eaten alive by naked mole rats. I'm having a little difficultly dealing with Cara being here...she just does and says such ridiculous things I can only be civil. Whatever friendship we had has passed...I'd like to think I learned a lesson or two out of it, but if she has she's keeping it secret because she still has all the same old annoyances. I like to come home and be relaxed..but I always feel tense and on edge when she's here. The very air tightens up.  I realize perhaps from another point of view this may all seem very petty on my part.  I really can't defend myself in that case, I'm sure that a lot of things I do are also ridiculous and incoherent to other people. But at least I try to practice what I preach, so to speak. I shall be civil to her because she is our guest (and she still pays some rent), but I can't do anymore. I'd feel like I was cheating myself, pretending to display emotions that I do not feel.   At any rate, the lifeguard thing never went through, Rachael had to study, and Ryan wasn't home. So I watched Mallrats with B and then Alex came over and we rented The Princess Bride and watched that. It was a good evening, anyway, but disappointing as I did not get out of the house and associate with the rest of the world. I had an interesting dream about Ryan...well, he wasn't the main character but always in my peripheral vision. Kind of haunting..I can't explain. Ah well, "I can't explain" comes in handy for a lot of what goes on in my head, not just dreams. sigh.

      options for the evening:    waiting for the other guards to call and tell me if there is still Pat McCurdy action tonight at the Annex.  If I don't get a call by 7:45, I think I shall call Rachael and see if she wants to go, in which case we might end up running into work buddies anyhow. If she doesn't want to go, then I am going to call Ryan, because he mentioned that he was interested.  If Ryan can't go, then I guess my roomates will have to entertain me. Heheh. Wes is supposed to call, I guess, but then he was supposed to call about a movie last night so we'll see. I should have gone and practiced, instead of sitting around here reading Mademoiselle. Arrgh. OH well, baby steps getting back into shape, I suppose. At any rate, going out tonight is a HUGE priority for me, especially with the other lifeguards, as I would like the opportunity to get to know them better (and, ultimately, have friends outside of the music school) and hang out with them. So, just as well better free up the phone line (although now we have nifty Callwave which takes messages for you) and get started on the evening!

      I think I need to clarify last night.  It was nice to hang out with Ryan...because I wasn't expecting anything from him.  I realized that if I go around thinking that everything I say and do has to correspond with some level of emotional commitment, I'm just going to be nervous and act like a fool. So I went out and was myself....which is something that's easy to do around him anyway.  It's easier to act like he's oblivious to everything and just be friends rather than to assume that everything I do has to be an act in order to keep his friendship and not alienate him. Things are only awkward if you make it so in your head. So it was a good time because it was like hanging out with an old bud....nevermind that for a while I was tragically in love with him. :) I'm not going to analyze any of it...nothing of what he said, nothing about the hello and goodbye hugs, nothing! (ha!) I'll just go crazy again. I got what I wanted, anyway...which was to just be able to hang out with him again. I'm still a little miffed (and he knows it, too, he said as we parted ways, "ha, well, I'll see you in October, then!" so i punched him in the arm. :) but I'm not just going to bring it up because I don't feel like the playing field is quite level yet. Updates to follow. Nice to not have to be pissed off, anyway. OH yeah...this summer he's been in S. Carolina. So I guess the little part of me that said, "he's out of town," triumphs after all. Ah, ye of little faith.

      so sad!! i have just returned from seeing Artificial Intelligence. I cried for the last half hour!!!!!!!! I'm still sniffly.  (lauren then prompts her audience "but, who did you see it with?") Audience: "but, Lauren, who did you see it with?" Lauren: "ah, well, he's an old bud of mine, you know." A: "don't beat around the bush!" L: "ah, you know, ahem, Ryan." A: "Ryan?!?" L: "yes, Ryan."  and how was it, you then ask? (davis did) Well, here's the deal:  he called yesterday and left a message, and I was going to be testy and wait a few days, but then he called again today. And we caught up a bit on the phone, and I felt like I didn't have to pretend, and a few months (but only a few) of resentment melted away. So we went out and sat on the terrace for a little while and talked about music and dogs and everything else. And then went and saw said movie. So I was trying to measure my reaction, but the funny thing was, I don't think I had one other than, "I'm glad to be with my friend again." friend, hmm, key word or not? as of yet I cannot tell where I stand emotionally (as movie has drained me of emotion), and shall have to see...mostly I'm just happy that we're in touch and that he considers me "his only friend in madison this summer." so it's all good. i'll keep you posted. and i shall have happy dreams. :)

      here's the big scoop on the last four craaazy days!  thursday, jon was here when i got back from work! so we (b and i) took him on a tour of the campus and learned about carillion bells, and watched traffic (good movie, set in san diego!).  didn't really get enough sleep (5hrs) as had to get up for work at six...but it was okay. Jon and I attempted to purchase alcohol using his fake (his brother's) but apparently madison is a tougher place to be underage than even california (he says, since he's had no problem with it there). anyway, Ben got us some, which proves that the youth of today cannot be deterred by silly restrictions. So we had a party!  A random, but very enjoyable, group of people came.  Wes, Darren, Sean and his gf Kristen, Collin (!),  Rachael from work, her friend Jason (who was very very cool), Alex, Ben, Jon, Davis, B, me, all told. Not a big party but we had fun! Despite not everyone being acquainted it went over very well. A minor incident occurred: Davis disappeared and we worried about her, but she made it back okay. She says she went for a walk. :) But she doesn't know where. hehe! Saturday arrives, and we go to Chicago! Alex had a little car trouble but we got off okay, around four, and made it to Ravinia at 6:30. Ran into Miah and Sarah! It was awesome. Caught up with both of them, and enjoyed Shostakovich immensely.  They played the end of the fourth half tempo and everything. The low brass was all ringers...but they still played amazingly. Man!! Someday..... Today we woke up and made blueberry pancakes...which were a disaster cooking but ended up being yummy anyway.  Sent Jon off at 11:30 and went to work, 1-4. And that is everything updated! A good time. I hope Jon had fun and gets home safe! :) Now, it's time to recover some sleep. pfft!

      i think i've figured something out. one of the reasons i miss ryan so much is that when we hang out, i feel like i have someone direct the majority of their attention on me. i mean, in an overall context. uncomfortable as i am being the center of attention, i think one of the things that made me like him so much was that he always seemed interested in me all the time...which is a complete shocker in my little self-contained bubble. sigh. i'm going to call him twice more...once tomorrow, to see if he wants to party with us friday, and once before the Wes and Lauren Birthday Extravaganza.  And that's it, if he fails to get in touch with me either of those times, I can't do any more or it'll just tear me apart. I've gotta let it go sometime...there's no better time than summertime to be free....

      the best way to combat sadness is to make yourself busy! I have been ACCOMPLISHING GREAT THINGS today and it is a good feeling. Perhaps they are not all great things to everyone else, but they are working out for me. :) 1) I finally called a beach supervisor to ask them if i could get my uniform 2) Called Alex to see if he can drive on Sat (he can!) 3) Ordered four marvelous CSO/Ravinia tickets so, hurray! can't wait for the weekend and jonny and shostakovich 5 (which i am now going to go listen to)....perhaps we'll have a little party on friday night. ;)

      phone number has been taken off internet, moment of loneliness has passed and therefore no internet weirdos shall be haunting me with phone calls. phew.   yes, i feel better. sort of. davis and i talked. bethany and i didn't, which is what stresses the "sort of" okayness mood. we got our wires crossed yesterday and i had left to go to the gritty to see collin before she got home from a day with her mom, and she was upset because we had planned to go see fireworks together, a fact that i completely forgot in my rush to go see a  boy  of all silly things, and i felt/feel incredibly guilty and not at all equipped to deal with the situation. Ben told me that I did what I could, and he thought that Bethany had accepted my apology, but if I know B correctly her body language was all wrong and she was still upset with me last night. After Qdoba I went home alone...and hence the height of my self-tragedy. Ah me, what a little melodramatic fool I am.  Mostly I was mad at myself for being impatient (of course i shouldn't expect a newly turned 21 year old to give up his night at the bars for a foolish underager who thinks she maybe likes him or something), and unhappy about being alone, and sad about my failure to be a good friend, and lots of other things all stemming from deep-seated self-confidence and awareness issues. Sigh. It's not as if the whole Collin thing didn't end on a hopeful note. It did, rather. ("Hey, wait, when will I see you next?" "well, i'm always at humanities, or give me a call! i'm usually around""okay, that's right, i have your phone number now!""alright, well, don't get into trouble hon, and have fun!") Little seeds of self-doubt always creep in, however, so most of happiness is therefore smashed before i have time to get into too much trouble. Bleh. I wish boys would like me more, my romance skills are rusty (almost corroded) and most of the time I haven't got a clue what's going on. ARGH. ok, i suppose the best thing to do would be to get on with the day and start fresh.

      The big news on Blogger.com is that, apparently, Blogger is a great way to get some boo-tay.    And now I am wondering...are people I don't know reading my blog and wondering? It surely can't be that exciting. My number of philosophical and introspective posts has decreased quite a bit this summer. And lately I've been reduced to observations about spiders (by the way, wouldn't it be cool to have eight limbs?!?!). Sigh.   At any rate, spiders are the reason I slept very poorly last night. I like to watch spiders, I like their webs (but not for walking into), I like the way the move around and eat mosquitos.  But I don't like having bad dreams about them that wake me up in a cold sweat and leave me unable to calm down or go to sleep for a good half an hour. It was quite amusing that I woke up, gave a rather loud gasp of suprise, and heard Davis say this, in her sleep: " Don't worry, we'll get to go shopping tomorrow!" I said, "What?!?" and she said, "Don't worry about it, we'll go shopping tomorrow!" And then she rolled over and sank into happy dreamland whilst I, panicky and upset about Corporal Zulu descending on my helpless form with an army of similiarily ugly-type arachnids to chew my head off and suck out all my juices, stared at the ceiling for a while squirming everytime my skin twinged or the blanket brushed my cheek. Eventually I fell into a fitful sleep and woke up worried the next morning that in my myopic condition I would not see Corporal Zulu swinging aimlessly from the ceiling at about eye-level, and walk into him, and then faint, either of fright or of spider bite. At any rate, Corporal Zulu moved back to his original position just above Davis' dresser, and has spent most of his day going up and down, up and down, presumably looking for something good to eat. In all likelihood he is harmless and terrified of my clumsy four-limbed bulk and wants nothing to do with me or my bedsheets.  Relax, relax. Spiders are very little and very timid. Spiders like Corporal Zulu (I have not yet identified his family and genus yet) like to stay on the ceiling and stay out of trouble. Deep breaths. Calm, Hawaii, ocean waves, margaritas, teddy bears, back massages. Okay, I think I'm okay now. Okay. Ohhhhkay.

      Corporal Zulu has begun his descent from the ceiling!   Corporal Zulu is the name we have given to the big scary spider that is hanging from the ceiling in Davis' and my room.  He used to be sitting innoculously in the corner, far away from beds and closets and such. But now he has moved to the center of the room! We are all terrified of him. I have sworn that the next time he is within reach I will capture him and take him away. Unfortunately, deep in my heart I know I lack the guts to do such a thing. This is the problem with being a wuss. Corporal Zulu will dominate my life until he is removed from the ceiling. When will he make his move?!?! He's waiting to kill us all, I know it. I can see it in his beady little eyes...

      a good evening, spent at the union with bethany, emily and ben, and ben's two friends from nicaragua, maria and becca.  many funny moments (as happens with people who don't speak a language as well), and overall entirely enjoyable!

      current source of   extreme   happiness:  talked to collin and roomate greg (also attractive) while wearing sexy black clothing (for LMS gig).  also, i just saw ian and andy, on their way to "practice" (trans=drink beer at union). Which reminds again that I am excited for school to start and to see everyone again. I also saw BJ earlier. He was obsessing about the Twins and being able to look up Twins scores on the new humanities computer.   unfortunately, all this happiness is wasting away because my roomates are watching a movie and I have no one to annoy. Time to make phone calls.

      currently wondering:   how am i going to get to my LMS gig on the east side tonight?   current source of happiness:  1) talked to collin 2) almost finished with  Catch 22  3) had wonderful hour-an-a-half warmup session in which i played two songs by ear (i'm learning!) and ALMOST hit a high F (necessary for playing DeMeij T-bone Concerto)  current source of bewilderment: just woke up from nap

      Hmm...Davis now has a "comment" link on her page, where you can post a comment relating to a specific blog and whatnot. neato. I would like such a thing! It's research time. :)  the freshmen are coming, the freshmen are coming!!!!! I rode past Good Ol' Ogg Hall today, and people are moving in. Hehehe. Pretty soon groups of kids, dressed to kill and looking about nervously as they try to give off the air of "cool and casual college kid," will be parading the streets searching for their first big party.  I can't believe this will be my third year of college.  In middle school I thought I'd never be a high schooler, in high school I only  dreamed  about college (if i even thought about it at all outside of senior year), and now, good grief, I'm halfway done. Pretty soon I have to go out and be an ADULT....which scares the pants off of me. I think the adult world is the most depressing of all. Who wants responsibility, and bills, and a full time job? No wonder some people never want to leave college.  Gotta make your twenties last...stay young, stay beautiful, keep partying.  The Great American Dream.

      alive, and once again back in Mad-town! it's back to PRACTICING, which went extraordinarily well this morning and I shall be returning for another go tonight.  Home was...well, it was iffy whether or not it was worth it. I did get to see Megan, Marisa, Natalie, Tara, Dan, Katie, Jon, Jennii (i think that's everyone), I did go waterskiing, I did get to the beach. On the other hand, I missed Pastor Mark, Sean and Jessie, I didn't practice very much, and I got a terrible sunburn.   Well, life is full of such pros and cons. That's the way it goes. Natalie did give me some French verb cards, from which I have been studying frequently and my French is returning with great speed. Hurray! I am excited to be in a language class again.  I am just excited...you can already tell that this town is picking up. I ran into Mr. Smith in front of Cafe Royale; we had a nice chat about summer. He really is a funny funny guy. He's just hard to hear from the back row of wind ensemble so you can't tell whether or not he's insulting you.  I ran into Sean Greene and Justin on my way to practicing, and Dan and a vocalist, Chris, in the library.  At the library I found a score to Fancy Free! Now, if only Jason will give me my tape back...  My brief time at home has reawakened my eyes as to how unique Madison really is.  The people here are just...different. It's an atmosphere, it's fun. You see the same people over and over again. Ah yes.  I guess I do have two homes. :)

      argh, life:   JeanV999: But you do need that complication to make life a little more complete, though! Llama721: the roller coaster of life has not yet seen fit to throw a complicated romance curve into my riding enjoyment. call it bad feng shui, what you will.  JeanV999: *lol* Very poetically put. Llama721: perhaps there is a wastepaper basket in my love life corner JeanV999: Yes, and then maybe the shredder of heartbreak will be unplugged off the wall? Llama721: indubitably JeanV999: Get it off you, really, just find somebody that you can have a decent time with, take the plunge, then dump him if you want, and it will really feel like you got through an important part of life, even if it's a little artificial Llama721: look, i'd love to, really.  Llama721: it's not like i'm not trying JeanV999: But you DO sound upset :-) Llama721: i just get frustrated because EVERYONE, not just you, darling, fawns about how wonderful and fun i am and how oh dear, why doesn't she have a boyfriend? and it just works exactly the wrong way in my head Llama721: because that's all great and wonderful but let's face the truth here, people, they aren't lining up at my door or anything.  Hans then goes on to say that, once again, he doesn't understand why the above statement isn't so. And that, given the opportunity, yes, he would sleep with me. Thanks Hans. I do appreciate it and I am not insulted about anything. I entirely agree, life is nothing if not thoroughly infused with "complications" and we'd never learn anything if it wasn't. As it is I am tired of watching my friends deal with "complications" and I would like a shot at my own.   and so on. ha-rumph.

      hey hey hey buddha stew!  yesterday I went waterskiing with Megan and Marisa! I'm sore. I'm hearing from muscles in my back that I didn't even know existed. I didn't do so hot...I got up three times for about ten seconds average. But it was fun!   Had to talk Jennii back into the bonfire...she was concerned that it would be a waste to save a pit and not have very many people show up, as the situation is suggesting currently. But, in my humble opinion, a bonfire is always fun (except for that one with the frisbee and Jakob, that infernal Swedish idiot..I have nothing against Swedish people, just Jakob) so we shall go through with it anyhow.  huzzah!!

      I bought some sassy new clothes today.  JC Penney is having a big sale, and on top of the discounts and the ten percent off coupon, my mom gets twenty percert for working there...so I went nuts. I got some sexy black boots. Oh yes. I feel like a badass in these boots. Ooooh yes. Badass. Oh. Yes. Uhhh-huh, baby-o.  Well, I have momentarily tamed my female urge to shop. Megan is back! Marisa and I picked her up at the airport and we sat in Balboa Park for a while. We're up to no good again this evening, after supper has been accomplished by our respective families. Huzzah. Maybe I can come up with a reason to wear my sexy badass boots. Hmmm.....

      i had two crazy dreams last night. one was scary! and the other was frustrating. They both involved, as the main character, this guy who resembled in many ways the guy from the party at HQ that Davis, B and I were checking out (I think his name was Nate, but, like everyone else at that party he refused to make eye-contact with me so I know nothing else about him). Anyway, to the dreams:   The first, I was exploring some sort of fishing community, and the only way to travel on it was to swing back and forth to each platform, where a different fisherman (or woman) was working. I was on this old man's platform, and his was a little farther away than the others from the one following, so I was having trouble working up the courage to swing across. But finally I took my window, and *plop!* I fell in. They all laughed at me, and especially when I tried to get up on the platform and kept tipping it (apparently there was no one fishing on this one). They told me I was scaring the fish...so I looked down into the water and suddenly I was sitting at a table, underwater! I could breathe. I think it was a ping-pong table. At any rate, the marine life was amazing...weird sea creatures floating around blithely in that weird-sea-creature way. I was talking to someone on the other side of the table. I don't know who it was. While I was talking this creature that looked like a cross between a jellyfish, an octopus, and a squid swam up and climbed up the wall on my right side (apparently i was now in some sort of submerged gaming room). I looked over at it (admiring its oddness, of course), and it had changed! Now it was a cross between a jellyfish, an octopus, a squid, and a man! Not just any man, oh no, but the incredibly gorgeous man mentioned earlier in the blog. He was mostly man, but he had weird little tentacles in and was sort of gelatinous. The person I was talking to (who at this point became Sarah Florino) said, "Be careful about the tentacles, they sting. And I should know because..." and then she kept talking but I didn't hear her because Jellyfish/Octopus/Squid Man was moving in my direction. And he starting teasing me about something, and then, out of nowhere, he starts tickling me! But it hurts, because he has stinging tentacles. (at this point I'm sure I starting thrashing around in my bed) I start freaking out....I can't move without getting stung more, I can't push his away so I start screaming, "Get away from me, GET AWAY! Get away, get away!" Which, of course, snaps me awake, sweating and terribly grossed-out. It's 7:45...to early to get up! So i go back to sleep. Dreaming once again...  This time I'm in my own house, and my parents have been so kind as to let a few people stay overnight. The only problem is, the only person I know is Davis! And the good-looking guy, no longer with tentacles and fully solid. There are four others, two girls, two guys, and they are young, 16, 17. They pair off (of course) and my parents have a horrific time trying to prevent sex happening on their floors. Meanwhile, I'm in the bathroom, and I don't have any pants on, for some reason. The hot guy walks in on me, and is completely non-plussed. So I'm not either, I guess (I didn't seem to mind at the moment). I don't say a word to him. Suddenly, he looks at me disgustedly and exclaims "Well, you don't have to hit on me! What are you thinking?" I look at him bewilderly and he runs out of the bathroom. I put some pants on, and help my parents play sex police for a while, but then I run across Davis and the boy talking and they both look up at me and smile. Davis has shorter hair.  I shrug, and leave...and suddenly I'm lying on my bed, once again not wearing any pants.  And the boy walks in again, emits an expression of rage, and shouts "Again! Stop flirting with me!" Now, I'm pretty pissed off at this point, so I get up, put on pants (good grief) and look at myself in the mirror. I have long, blonde hair! And the face isn't exactly mine either. But this doesn't faze me, I just say, "wow, my hair's growing fast" and walk into the living room. Once there, I proceed to shout obsenities and insults at the boy, citing that "you wouldn't know if someone was flirting with you if they hit you with a truck and screamed it at you through a megaphone!" Screaming, again, awakens me. Frustration, anger, and small amounts of self-doubt assail me.   And those, darlings, are my dreams. I think I can come to a conclusion about both, but for the sake of time and blog space, i shan't right now. :)

      ah well, the Zoo never worked out. They left just as I was leaving the airport...a fact which annoys me just a little (why couldn't they wait half an hour?) but then there was no way for them to know! Ah well, I talked to Jessie on the phone last night.  I did get my teeth cleaned today! hurray! i love going to the dentist. I know this sounds odd and not at all American but I do. Kathy, the hygenist, is hilarious and Dr. Aanuerud is pretty cool. Mostly it's just because, ever since I got my braces off, I've had this obsession with keeping my teeth clean and shiny. Hmm. My wisdom teeth, in keeping with my dental history, are underdeveloped and slow to erupt. They don't have any roots yet! And from how it looks, I don't have any upper ones at all. At any rate, this is the "perfect time" to get wisdom teeth out, when they don't have any roots. Yargh. Ok, we'll think about that when it gets closer to Christmas Vacation.   *Rumble rumble!* My tummy is hungry. I hope dinner is ready soon.

      I am home! Ah but which home, you ask, as I have been known to say that Madison is as much my home as San Diego...now that I repeat this I see it isn't true. Madison is my home away from home...but not completely, not sufficiently.  San Diego shall always be my home. I knew this the minute I stepped outside...and breathed the very air that surrounds my home town. The sky was that shade of blue that only California can accomplish, the sun was...well, sunny, and the ocean and downtown of course have remained the astonishing and beautiful creations that they are. Upon arriving I met my dad, and he informed me that, yes indeed, Megan is going to be home this weekend! And I will see Jessie and hopefully others (Jon, Nat, Tara...) tonight. On the ride home I laughed outloud at two memories that flashed into my head. The first was Jeff thinking the Cadillac's trunk wasn't shut completely (when in fact it is automatic and shuts on its own) and getting his fingers stuck underneath!!! The second was a most likely little remembered conversation I had with Mike about where to go for Prom dinner...he suggested this place he knew of that was near the 163-15 split.  I was puzzled because there is next to NOTHING at the split for at least two miles either direction (except for Miramar)...ah, so we had a joke about the invisible floating restaurant above the split.   As much as San Diego is still home...my actual house is not. It's changed. I've changed. I can't be a college student there because I was a high school kid in the same physical space; there's too much discrepancy between "was" and "is" that I have trouble adjusting. I figure this is the same type of thing every kid has coming home after long absences.  Still, it's remarkable to actually experience the things everyone told you you'd be experiencing at some point or another.  So home has become the whole town, the memories, and the fun I know is inherent in these streets I know so well...while reliving old happy memories you create new ones. La Jolla is always La Jolla (even though the squirrels have taken over and declared martial law), the Zoo is always World-Famous, and even my high school has things to offer (going back and making fun of the kids in band camp)...ah San Diego. I am extremely lucky to have grown up in such a place. I am extremely lucky at any rate, and I must never forget it!

      Buddha Stew is so pretty. I am proud of my color coding acheivements. Although there is so much more I can do. Ah...but that's what going home is for! Time on your hands  and  a cable modem. Although I just noticed that if I want to abbreviate Buddha Stew it's BS...which I guess is fitting in many ways.   Well!!! Yesterday I took the plunge. I signed myself up for French 203. I'm scared! I haven't studied french for a year and a summer. That's a long time. I tried to remember some verbs today, and I even had trouble with  etre ! Ah well, I will do mass studying for the next three weeks and it'll all be okay. I also have an auditon date and time:  August 31st, at 3:20 pm. In Mills Hall. Mills! EeeeK! Big, loud, scary Mills Hall. Yikes. Ok, ok, calm. It'll all be okay...  No news. I have just eaten a peach and I am, therefore, content. Almost finished with  The Brothers Karamozov .  It is very good! I can't put it down for more than two hours or I get antsy. Dmitri's trial will start soon, and my guess as to who murdered Fydor Karamozov was right! Although...I still have another two hundred pages to go, and Dostoyevsky is oh-so-good at plot twists. I'd like to finish it before tomorrow, so I can start a new book on the plane. I went to the University Book Store on Saturday and, lo and behold, they were having a 1/2 price book sale. So here's a list of what I bought:    The Tao of Pooh  and  The Te of Piglet , both by Benjamin Hoff;  The Dharma Bums  by my favorite Beat, Jack Kerouac;  The Unbearable Lightness of Being , Milan Kundera;  Hocus Pocus , Kurt Vonnegut;  Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas , Tom Robbins;  Lolita , Vladimir Nabokov;  and a book of selected poems by Allen Ginsberg.   I haven't decided which one to start next. The problem is, I said I would start  Catch 22  as soon as I finished Brothers, and after that,  The Sound and the Fury .  But here I am with all these books I desperately want to read right way, and I think Heller and Faulkner are going to have to wait another long while. I'm leaning toward Vonnegut, but the Kundera sounds awfully tempting. Help!

      the big question of the weekend has been:  What to get Grant for his birthday?  I am starting to get an inkling of an idea...we shall see. I was going to get him a winter hat (as he has none and it is very pitiful and makes me cold just to look at him) but "we don't start getting those in until the end of September" was the response I've gotten from the places I've looked. Sigh.   Grant's birthday means it is Chris' too! Perhaps a phone call to Boston will be made...and, Hurray! today is the last day of Drum Corps. Perhaps we'll start seeing some old friends more regularly now. Can't wait for move-in time, when everyone will start ringing our doorbell and visiting again.    I yelled at Ryan yesterday, but he laughed at me. Ok, so it was kind of funny. He called to find out if there was a party at Issac's, and I had no idea so I said, "how the hell should I know if there's a party at Issac's?!?!" But he didn't hear me (something up with his phone)  so I had to repeat it about five times and each time I got angrier until finally he did hear me and he chuckled, that Ryan-chuckle thing that usually delights me but just ended up being terribly annoying at the time. Anyway, didn't go to Issac's, and didn't call Ryan back (as he said, call me if you're going, and not, call me either way mwahahahaha!). thought about other things. mostly about how to get back at Kris Nonn for ragging on me all the time. So far, I have not come up with any solutions. Tonight is the last night I have to put up with it though, it's all good.  We are having a party after the show...hopefully people will come and have a good time. At any rate, it's time to go out into the world and get some fresh air.

      hmm...in an effort to drown out the musical crap I heard on z104 at work today, I came home and cleaned the kitchen to the American Graffitti soundtrack. Good music never fails. :)  not too much longer til I go home! The weather today in Madison is perfect San Diego:  a bit of a chill to the air but still sunny and warm. Beautiful.  Only two more days of OTT and then, basically, I go home! Hurray!   There isn't a lot to be said today...so I shan't force it.

      scoobadobadowaaaadibadascoowadi ba bida skeewadah  another hoooooooooottt day in madison wisconsin. waaa dahbiba twadi skeedoba  i'm thinking about singing, whistling, and all other musical type things i do in public without really realizing that i do them. i just do. it's part of my nature to burst into song or whistle whatever i've just been practicing. the only reason i became aware of the "oddness" of this (in other people's eyes) is that i completely startled a girl sitting on a bench in humanities today. i don't think she expected anyone to come out of a room whistling. she looked at my strangely, and as i walked past, she smiled humorously, as though i was quaint. inwardly, i laughed, so i started singing outloud. hwahaadobadowa...i like singing. improvising stuff, mostly. would i still like it if i heard what my voice sounded like to other people? i hope so. ah well, let 'em suffer.

      see lauren. see lauren bored. see lauren also hot, sweaty, and not really tired enough to go to bed. sooooo....here's what lauren's going to do:  she's going to open to a random page in  how to do (almost) everything  and tell all the world how to do it. ready? here goes the flippage....alright...everyone prepare yourself to learn (drumroll please):    How to Throw a Football  Throwing a football poses a problem for many people because of the ball's size and unique shape.  But with a little practice, you can throw like a pro.  More or less.   Steps 1) Grip the football by interlacing your fingers between the football's laces and seams.  2) Protect the ball by cradling it with two hands, and hold it just under your chin as you step back to throw.  3) Cock your throwing arm back with your elbow bent. 4) Extend your free arm in fornt of you for balance; point the arm and hand at your target.  5) Keep your shoulders level for a short pass (10 yards or less); dip the shoulder of your throwing arm for longer distances.  6) Snap your arm forward and floow through with your shoulders and hips as your weight shifts to your front foot.  7) Release the ball when your arm is slightly above your head and out to the side.  8) Add velocity and spiral to the ball by flicking your wrist and fingers just as you release it.  9) Finish with your index finger pointing forward and down, and with your palm facing the ground.   Congratulations everybody, you can now throw a football. Stay tuned for more interesting unrelated How-To instructions.   Anyway, I got a great email from Tara today.  I'm going to put a quote of hers in the quote spot. I quite enjoy it.  Ice Princesses Unite!

      well, yesterday was a fun-packed day! Emily and I took off for Chicago via the 5 am Van Galder bus (or van gelder as i am so fond of misspelling it) and once there, met up with her friend Harrison and his brother Lee. We hung out at Navy Pier and rode the Ferris Wheel, explored the Aquarium (it took us at least forty-five minutes of waiting in line to get in), saw a movie, walked Grant Park, and all that fun stuff.  Harrison is a very entertaining person and reminds me of Mike Muna in a lot of ways, and is totally the opposite at the same time (much less rock'n'roll lifestyle ;).  His brother was a sweetheart too. So it was a good day. The bus ride back I spent trying to make a decision. Before all of my personal tradegy on Sunday night, I had been mentally preparing the sort of things I wanted to say to Ryan if I ever had the courage to pin him down.  You know, stuff like "Not only did you break my heart, but you totally went against your word..." or "i can't stand seeing you again after periods of absence, because I realize I haven't recovered..." blah blah blah.  No. I think before I do that (and in order to give myself a situation in which I could say such things) I have to be a little extreme first. You can all shoot me if you think I'm wrong or if this is a horrible plan that will backfire and leave me twice as upset as before, please tell me.  I'm just not going to call him, or ask him to do anything with me.  If he comes over I will be perfectly civil but not friendly.  Let him be buds with Emily, which seems to be more on his agenda that being friends with me is.  I know this is horrible and jealous. If you understood how absolutely FED UP I am with this whole situation, I think it might make sense. I just can't do it anymore.  In order to put my heart back together I have to play the Ice Princess (sorry for stealing your role, Megan, I'll get it back to you as soon as I'm through).  I will be happy and busy (yargh,  The Rules )...too busy for him. I swear...I can't have him mucking around with my emotions anymore. The Great Ryan Depression stops now.

      i have so many people i love...for different things, for special things each...people make me happy. but there must be something wrong with me.  when am i on the receiving end of this compliment? i'm not a sparkling conversationalist, i don't even tease well or have dashing wit. always outshone, never in the spotlight. never singled out for anything...but what's the point? i know it's not everything. bt it's something i wish i had...even for a little bit. no, if i try to bring attention to myself i get shot down, or i interrupt something and am ignored (my own fault, i know) or i just start talking nonsense that no one cares to listen to.  sometimes i feel like i shouldn't talk at all.  i can't compete...why should i bother?   i know davis doesn't feel pathetic or lonely about boys, and this is very good. I am proud of you davis....keep it up. unfortunately i feel VERY pathetic and VERY lonely about boys, and i think it's the root of most of my social issues. I don't know...I have wonderful friends, but as is human nature I am greedy and I want more.  It is very difficult to watch your roomate be her wonderful and very charming person (both reasons why i love her) around someone you wish could be yours...and know that you just can't compare, that's it obvious there's nothing left over for you. Jealousy is a feeling I truly despise having...and yet I seem to be so practiced at it.  Why must I be so possessive about people? Is it because I crave attention so badly? I don't need to compete...it just makes things worse. but i do anyway. Tonight was a battle for control...of my own will. The part of me that just wanted to give up and cry it out later won. Which is a good thing in at least one way:  I didn't make a fool of myself or further demolish my connection to either roomate or boy. but now I'm just fed up. I crave love, attention, total involvement. Everything. And as I know that I can't have it (oh, you can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait) unless  am patient and undemanding....well, I guess I'll just have to get over it. Self-pity...my mom always warned me about it. She wouldn't take any of it. Maybe she had a point.

      yes yes, i know that buddha stew has not been very entertaining or even remotely interesting lately, for which I apologize. Not much is happening. OTT is going fine. I am spending a good deal of time making cracks at Kris Nonn (and getting many back in return) and joking around with Justin.  Now here's a weird thing, I just did it:  Words that end in "IN" like Justin, sometimes I spontaneously add a "g" to the end because it makes it more like my last name. Sort of a force of habit. Ah yes. habit.   Boys! I am very annoyed. That's all I have to say about that.   Laughter is such a wonderful thing. I have some friends I would like to hear laugh again (dan and natalie, jessie, megan) because it would make things a little more complete. I wish there was no such thing as absent friends...if i could gather all my friends from all over the country together in one place, i would do it in a flash. but no one place is perfect for everyone, and absence makes the heart grow fonder ("or forgetful" to quote Robin Hood) so I guess I cannot have what I wish for. I would like to see Chris and Mike again (on a regular basis, and preferably not discussing drum corps ;)...actually I am missing a lot about Humanities and the friendliness that goes on there...especially in the hallway by my locker. So much good stuff. I'm currently trying to remember something particularily funny that Sean and I were laughing about once...but it's just not coming to me. I think it has something to do with the time and temperature lady, but i'm not exactly sure what.....OOOOOOH I've got it. It was the Touchtone Enrollment Joke.  OH yes. "HI, and welcome to the University of Wisconsin Touchtone Enrollment System. For a major scale, press one. For a minor scale, press two. For assistance in slide positions, press three. If you have a question about additional techniques, please stay on the line. Thank you."  Ah yes...that was great. that went on for days, I recall. Priceless. Well, now that I've remembered it, I can go to bed happy. :)

      today, Madison WI has been given an excessive heat warning. and good lord, yes it does feel like it. i need to go to walgreens but i'd rather just sit on my bed reading, with the fan blowing right in my face.  i'll get there...i just need to stop being so damned sweaty and hot first. i hope it's not like this tomorrow, when i have to spend eight hours at olbrich beach. grr. two more weeks, only! till i go back home to my parents' air conditioned house. hurrah.

      Dear Bob Saget: I am  pi  years old, and I would like to audition for the talent search you're having on your ugly television program. You are my favorite TV milk and I think you would like my act. I open by playing the beef.  Then I sing "Somewhere Over the Lauren" while juggling three ass munchers.  Then for a really cocksucking finish to my act, I recite Lincoln's Gettsyburg Dick and go offstage waving an American whore. If you give me the chance, I'm sure that I can become another hoochiemama or maybe even another Alex.  And when I become rich and famous, I'll always tell everyone that you gave me my first big enema. Yours Truly, Grant

      yesterday was, in so many words, a miserable rotten no-good bad day.   i hate being depressed (not that anyone particularily digs it) because for me it always happens when there is no one around who is willing to listen. or give hugs. and not even little things (like half-smiles of pleasant surprise to see you) do any bit of good (in this case, it only made the knives sink deeper). sigh.   but today is a new day, a busy day...and hopefully it will be better.   it's ironic that Friday night I loved making music...there was so much thrill and passion and energy...and Saturday night it was hell to even listen to music. Friday night I knew what I wanted; Saturday night I sunk back into indecision.  sigh. little chunks of my heart keeping blacking out or dying of asphyxia. the chunks that manage to revive need a good stiff drink before they can continue with their heartly business. as do i, as do i. (but we can substitute stiff drink with large bowl of ice cream)

      arhahahgrhaargh.   yep, that pretty much sums up how i feel about relationships right now. damn frustrated. grr. arrrgh. arhahahgrhaagh.   sigh.   well, the wonderful news for today is that RFO is cancelled, and as much as I love pounding away at the contrabass balalaika, sometimes it's hard to work up the energy. and this is just one less thing i have to do!!! huzzah. i also have to make an appointment at the edwards factory for next sunday to put together my spiffy new bass trombone!!!! i'm so excited...this is going to be the most fun ever!!! (i know, i know, music nerd, but hey, what can i do?)   we desperately need to go grocery shopping...but i don't know when we'll have time. so i've been eating crackers and ramen noodles. not exactly healthy, but remember i can go out to eat because 1)i can't get any cash out (the bank's closed) and 2)i don't have an atm card at the moment. so....ramen noodles it is, one more night. hurray!   arhahahgrhaagh.

      well, shit. the loneliness is settling in again. do y'all know what i mean by "the loneliness?" (by the way, i just wanted to point out that for some reason, my last three posts have all used the phrase "y'all" and i'm not really sure where it's coming from. hmm) the loneliness for me is mostly just wanting somebody to lean on when i feel sad or stupid (the latter, in the case, is the cause of the former...for an explanation please see #1 of my Top Five Stupidest Things I've Ever Done list), and is compounded by the sight of two other people enjoying each other's company. you know what i mean. the loneliness sucks ass. i have managed to fight the loneliness but now that i can safely say i have recovered from being totally nuts about ryan it has come back with a vengeance. which doesn't really make sense, so let me rethink that. okay...i'm over the period of time where i felt like i had to be completely strict with myself regarding ryan, and now i just get to thinking that it's time for something new. Unfortunately this traps me in a vicious circle. Self-confident, happy lauren is overtaken by jealous, self-loathing lonely lauren whom nobody wants to be with. Yarrgh. whatever shall I do? :) it's alright...it's only one saturday night...  ah, but it's those saturday nights that really kill you...

So I'm telling everyone, go read Mikey's website, and meanwhile, he changes it to what is currently there...which is hiliarious but definitely not what I wanted y'all to read. Still, go see it. There is a tremendously funny comparision of some poor sap pictured in the Onion and the trumpet professor here, John Aley. Ok. Neat.   hmm...going to Milwaukee tonight with Ladies Must Swing...shall prove to be an interesting time, as playing with this group generally is. I have a feeling that I'm going to forget to do something this weekend, but I'm not quite sure what. Hmm...better look into that.

      i highly recommend y'all read Mikey's website, if you haven't already (he is linked at left). He has some very intelligent things to say and everyone should read them.   well! this week has gone by crazy fast. after the events of last week i feel like i'm off a day; i kept thinking today was friday (almost!). russian folk orchestra started tonight...i get to play contrabass balalaika! (That's the huge one) it rocks. I'm having a lot of fun...the parts are easier than secunda (as if that could be possible) so all i really have to do is get the technique down and then i should have it nailed.   ah...i'm tired. now that the party upstairs has subsided, i think i can attempt going to bed with a minimal amount of headache. schmu.

      i just don't know what to write. i have been realizing a lot of things this week, both about myself and about people, and i have discovered in myself such an intense love for all human beings that at times it almost overpowers me. i do not feel hatred, only sorrow...and it seems to me that to hate the perpetrators of this attack is only to aggravate the wound, to widen the rift between people of all backrounds.  the saying i have heard the most of this week is "we cannot fight evil with more evil" and i can't agree more.  it is sad to know that there is no one culture, no one nation that is entirely  innocent of crimes against humanity.  i have been looking inside myself to find the strength and love i know humans are capable of feeling. i am very proud of those who are helping, who are feeling, who are cheering on the survivors and rescuers. i am not proud of those who are looking for revenge. if you want revenge, the greatest and most powerful thing you can do is create peace, feel love. people are looking for a war now, and it tears my heart in two. the most relevant saying i can think of at the moment is: 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you.' peace, love, happiness.

      alright. all the other music majors in the world are out being productive and practicing right now. i should be engaging in this activity as well...in fact i  want  to be, but i have given in to going home and eating pop tarts on this excuse: due to the fact that i played too much on friday (in my post insulting-email-from-bill anger), or rather i played to much over one small period of time, and now i have a small cut on the right side of my inner upper lip...which makes a lot of things difficult (eating, talking...nothing gross!!!), not just playing. i am a little depressed about this fact. no one else is home. the back door was left unlocked, which for a second got my hopes up that i would have someone to commiserate with and therefore not be lonely. but no, it was not to be.   happy though...yes, the CAKE concert was marvelous. it was fantastic. i am still in awe that I have seen them perform live. it was a unique experience for me being a concert where i knew the words to all the songs.  i don't have many favorite single bands...of the two bands which i love and know all their songs, one I have just seen and the other (sublime) no longer exisits as a musical ensemble. so it was great. Unfortunately I was not as close as i would have liked to have been, but i could see, at least (due to the fortuitous placement of a bag of sand near my feet, i was able to give myself a few extra inches). They rocked. I love CAKE. I have a sticker. I love CAKE. I really reaaaally do.

      of everything i accomplish, the most important would be inner strength, character. but today i realize that i am the weakest of the weak. there is no strength in me that is capable of dealing with what needs to be done...and there is not strength even to run away and find something else.  no, i am as weak as i could be:  never moving forward or backward but only standing trembling in one place, unable to understand or reconcile anything. in the real world i will only be trampled and forgotten, all my endeavors will come to nothing and i shall only be ignored. my luck has run out.    what is it i love? what is it i do best? today i don't know anymore. music has offered me little solution. there is so much to learn, it's overwhelming. i'm so far behind, it's like looking up at the top of a mountain and having to climb it, even with a broken leg and a head cold. It could be worse...but it's pretty bad as it is.  such a prize is waiting at the top! but i only sink deeper into the mud. only a few get up, and i'm not one of them. victim of ridiculously high standards? i guess so. but i don't know what else i can do. the day you realize the rest of your life is at stake and there's only two choices open to you (run away, or keep climbing) is pain, hurt...the day you'll make the decision seems impossible and eternally far away. you're just too wrapped up in suffering to figure it out. what do i do? where do i turn? i have answers, but nothing seems to fit (or perhaps i just don't want to hear it).  it's only one day...and how huge it seems to loom when you don't perceive how much other time is waiting behind it in which you have to heal, to recover and to step forward healthy and conquering.   it hurts to hear that you're not good enough....but it hurts even more to know it's true.

      Ah....there's always that period of time after you make a decision that you know will work out for you (whether it be about living life, encounters with the opposite sex, or just plain organizational stuff) where it's stagnant, before things start happening, there is nothing. Just a sort of joyful disappointment that nothing's happened yet.  The "Ice Princess" manuever has worked out well. I am enjoying my freedom from complication and just being happy....I haven't worried about loneliness or self-doubt for a while. It's a very nice feeling. I guess I should just relax, and let nature and fate decide, take their time, and impliment whatever strategy they have for my forthcoming existence.   There is still Bethany sadness...If she reading this she should check out the CAKE tour page, for a nice surprise. :)  Corporal Zulu has taken off somewhere. He's not on his web on the lamp, nor is he camped out above Davis' dresser. No, he seems to be on sabbatical. Which is sad because he was becoming a part of our everyday existence (yes, I'll admit, I talked to him, asked him how his day was, if he'd caught any juicy flies... :), almost like a pet spider. I'd still be afraid of him if we came face to face, but I think we have an understanding that he stays up, and I stay down. So I am a bit disturbed that he has left. Where has he gone? Will he come back? Will we ever see him again?   Only one more day til we find out audition results. I'm more nervous for this than for the actual audition!!! The orchestra is playing Sheherazade and Shostie 5 for the first concert! AHH! What fun. I'd love to play that. I'd also love to be in Wind Ensemble again, because bands are fun when they're good and you play enjoyable music. But we'll see. Fingers crossed.

      Ah yesterday. What a draining, emotional day. I think at the end of it, though, I can say that it was good...sad, but good. We sent Bethany off around 10...and Davis and I sat on the couch and sobbed and sobbed and sobbed. I called in sick for work...well, it was my last day, so I suppose....hehehe. Pulled myself together and went to warmup...not all that exciting. But everytime I talked to someone about Bethany leaving I got a little teary. Went home, ate lunch...got dressed for my audition and went back to Humanities and played. Pretty well!!! I'm happy with how it went. There was a minor crisis about Til Eulenspuihoweveryouspellit:  Miah and Collin had to play it, as Bill thought it was on the audition list (another demerit for Bill!). I had to play it, but as sight-reading.  Becker gave me a huge Becker smile and Smith spent the whole audition looking at me with his myopic-mole nose-scrunch thing. And he said the same thing he said last year:  "much improved, Lauren, much improved" Good...I am so glad that's over. No more worries! Jerry talked me into auditioning for jazz band ("yeah, you should! Because the more people I know in jazz band, the better!"), so I've got to prepare that a little, but I'm not too worried.  They're pretty laid back about that.  I'll play some bass today and then work on the pieces I copied out of Joe's realbook.  After my audition I watched High Fidelity again with Emily, and then she went off on a date (ooh la la) and Abby and I went to one of the new sushi places on state street. Came back, sat around...Mike showed up, and we went to see Phat Phunktion at the Union. There we met up with Chris, Emily, Andy (date), Abby, Teresa, and various other people...Danced...I love Phat Phunktion---they play the absolute best live shows and they are so much fun! In case you aren't from the local Madison music scene (which rocks), PP is a funk/dance/70s type band. It's like Tower of Power mixed up with Jamiroquai. Only better. Yeah...so that was fun. Tired out and ready for bed, I came home and slept without an alarm clock! How wonderful to wake up naturally. So now I'm doing laundry and thinking half-heartedly about getting dressed.   Bethany's Bon Voyage party was a ton of fun. So many people came! It was awesome. Felicia, Mikey, Chris and I sat in the living room playing Charades with the tin I bought from Restoration Hardware...we were playing eariler but it was too loud and too busy....although Jerry trying to do "Ferdinand the Bull" was hilarious! (Prince....Tim! Prince....Rick...Prince...Raging Bull!!)  I think everyone had a good time.   Alright, it's time to go get my laundry. Huzzah! Bethany is arriving in Germany as we speak...yay!

("want some juicy fruit? it calms my road rage.") the concert debut of bernard as well. bien! glad it's over, that concert. old people in homes make me sad. it reminds me of my gramma. i hope that i can take care of myself when i am elderly.  okay. i'm tiiiired. and i have studying to do. (bleh!) studying...geez. i've already been studying! (studying trombone) isn't that enough for you people!!!!!!!! grr, argh, ha-rumph.   prretty pretty please comment!

      I'm trying very hard to have a good year...but so far it is just not happening.   Lesson learned last night: The more you look forward to things, the more disappointing they will be. I also realized that I am absolutely FED UP. Meaning, as much as I try to be myself and have a good time, I always end up concerned about what so-and-so will think about me, do they like me etc etc. So I'm fed up with this attitude. And I just feel very apathetic about everything (except bass trombone). I need some inspiration, I need to feel like I'm going somewhere...everything is so stagnant. I don't understand myself, either. I have nothing to complain about, but in my head there is always something wrong. The ghost of self-pity.   disappointment also extends to people: to friends, to boys, to society, to everyone. it's like dan's quote...but my island just seems to be miles and miles away from everyone else's. continental drift. I wish there wasn't so much in my head...maybe then i would find some peace and happiness. praise to the simple-minded! may we all strive to be less like Rabbit and more like Pooh-Bear.

      "Look at it this way. You, your personality, is an island. Everyone is an island, so we're all a bunch of islands in this big sea..and all we ever get to see of another person is their coastline. Maybe occansionally you'll send in an expedition, chart out some territory, but you'll never really get to the interior of someone else's island." --Dan B, 10/24/01  So I sucked it up and went swimming today, and I'm still waiting for the results. My nose isn't running as much, but the cough is getting deeper. So...oh well. I talked to Arwen and she was super excited about our halloween costumes. I am too. this is going to be fun. I desperately need some orange pants and shoes though. and a little orange scarf, and my ensemble is complete.   boys! (i mistyped that the first time and wrote "buoys") i think i've been reading the sex book too much, now on top of emotional loneliness the physical side is kicking in too. bleh. (jazz band concert very good tonight)  i have weird looking fingers. i've noticed it before, but i just looked again and there they are, in their weirdness. my fingernails are all goofy too, because i never know what to do with them so i just keep them short and then they grow out in new and exciting combinations each time. so my fingers are weird. my feet though, are very cute. i am proud of my feet.   ooookay! tangent, and i'm sure none of you cared. so i'm going to go to bed. just so. g'night.

      i had a thoroughly delightful dinner with Dan today. we went to einstein's and chatted about boys.   i also played bass trombone duets with Terry last night...and it was a blast. he's so amazing. i hope i can someday be at least a fraction of his musicianship. we traded horns for a while (he has an edwards bass too) and talked shop and christan and about how blair bollinger looks like a porn star. fun! i love my new horn.  i would also like to reaffirm how much i love my job (the nat). the people are so much fun. even morning shifts. yes. even those. and i scared some lady while i was doing my breathing exercises up on the stand by myself (you have to do something to keep yourself awake). fun fun fun. i am behind on my swimming though, so i have to go in tomorrow night and do a 1500. yargh. oh well.   still needing help on the comments bar. and don't be afraid to put in comments!!!!

      i will have to say that there is something to be said for not having a voice. you only say what is needed...and how often is that, really? i have had, to be sure, a certain amount of fun going about today writing notes to people and being cheerful. funny, eh? i recommend for a day trying to go with out saying much, and see how refreshing it is! you can say a lot with facial expressions. and little scraps of paper. yeah.   this cheerfulness is also an apology for my previous very whiny post. :)

      yes, i now have a beautiful shiny wonderful bass trombone. in exchange for this, i lost my voice. hehe. yes, it's not so much fun, but it's alright. it was probably not a good idea to drink beer last night (although not so much) and stay up late (2:30), but it was fun. kind of weird at some points, because i felt like just an onlooker, but i learned a lot about boys. went over to griff's and played video games and made prank phone calls to the dorms and such. well, they did. and i sucked at the video games. and then there was wrestling. and i almost fell asleep walking home. and i woke up with absolutely no voice and having to go to a rehearsal. i am becoming more and more convinced that sundays just absolutely blow. sunday nights especially. i mean, i have to work from 5-7, and then afterwards i meet with the pledges, or it's possible it's a sai meeting, or even an inservice for the nat. so no matter what i do, i get to run around and there is absolutely NO time to sit down and nap, which is my number 1 sunday activity. well, i'm just being whiny for the sake of being whiny, but i'm just kind of upset because a good deal of my weekends lately have absolutely sucked and i find myself looking forward to the week. because during the week i have regular sleeping hours and practice hours and such. and i don't freak out about boys and i'm not disappointed because a certain evening didn't go my way. so yeah, weekends suck. maybe next weekend won't. maybe i'll take the opportunity to get incredibly wasted next week and see where it leads me. yeah. great plan, lauren. (at least i won't be the only one: it's halloween and it's homecoming. rock). or maybe i'll just forgo all the festivities and sleep. mmm, sleep.  today was brandon's opera thing at canterbury bookstores. intending to go on time, i fell asleep reading and woke up late...so i went but i didn't feel like talking to anyone (or rather, i couldn't talk to anyone) so i just perused the book shelves and listened to the singing. i feel rather bad about not actually  going , so to speak, but oh well. life's full of little difficulties.   sigh.

      okay, 3 and a half hours of sleep tonight.  so why am i online then, instead of going to bed right away? well, i can't really answer that effectively. mostly i just thought it wouldn't make that much difference either way. so what follows will be a series of seemingly random exclamations, but which actually pertain to the events of this evening.   boys!!!!!  sex books!!! cats!!!  bass trombone!!! hurray!!!!  okay, bedtime!!!!!!!!! huzzah!!!!!

      ah, trombone-getting tomorrow! hurray! unfortunately i cannot go tonight because i could not find a sub for work, so now i have to make a one-day elgin trip, which is unfortunate because i love the s'murphys so and i would like to see them for more than five hours. sigh. ah well.   bad news on the bike: the new keys didn't work and if i want to get it cut i have to bring the lock into the store, which means i have to break the porch. hm. unfortunately we don't have anything convient with which to break the porch, so i've been kicking at it with my foot but that doesn't seem to work very well. argh.   a grip of mikey quotes lately, here's another: "oh, that's embodiment of all evil too, just in a convient pocket-sized form." regarding the confusing aspects of  the exorcist.   the game got more confusing today. first of all, i'm not sure how to take this, but how come homeless people are the only people that ever hit on me? it's weird. i was walking through homeless and druggie park on my way to the bike shop, and this guy walks up and says, "hey baby, where you been all my life." "zero points for creativity." i should have said, but instead i just ignored him. and then another guy askes for some change and i told him i didnt have any (which is true) and so then he says "that's, fine you're still looking good, baby!" (eek) "uh, great, have a good day." "you know that baby, right? Mm-hmm." this all ties back into that guy outside of knuckheads this summer who wanted me to buy him dinner and made similar comments. geez, people! should i be flattered, freaked out, or nonchalant?  second game confusion: was niles hitting on me at the donut table today? hm.  confused because the person who's supposed to be doing that sort of thing (translation: boy lauren wants to like her) was standing only three feet away. not that i minded the niles conversation. oh boys. you're so silly. here's lauren, intelligent witty charming, and oh yeah, what a niiiiiice ass, and no action!! let's get cracking, kids. i'm running of young carefree college time.   too much for some of you? kittens. roly-poly puppies. baby birds. sandcastles.

      shitty shit shittyness. my health is deteriorating into the sick zone. now, this is not so hot. nobody likes being sick, so you know how it goes. it sucks. especially when you have to play in perf class on monday and you already suck at your piece enough that getting sick isn't going to help anything. well, poo on my immune system! fucker.   mikey wants to know about "the game." ask me in person sometime, i'd be more than happy to tell you. it might envolve a long personal history of my misadventures in the world of boys. be prepared.   still no bike key, still no trombone. argh! i hate waiting. argh. okay. dishes to do, beds to sleep in. g'night

      hm...what to say? i met with the pledges for sai tonight, and i am very excited about them. they have a lot of energy and organization and i think it'll be a good year. i am very excited about sai this year...we finally got our butts in gear (sufficient leadership) and decided to make something out of this fraternity. hurray! i'm proud to be a part of it.   davis' recital was AWESOME. i wish I had been on the other side of the piano, but page turning was fun too. the brahms trio was excellent. hurray for them!   i am still tired. i think i've finally entered the perpetually tired zone stage of the college semester...which is way later than usual, but i won't complain about that. maybe i just should go to bed...mmm, bed.   well, all else to say is, i really really reeeeeeeeeeeeeeaally hope i get my trombone this coming weekend. reeeeallly. reeally really.

      i bought some stuff for my halloween costume today:  a cool orange plaid coat, and a fuzzy orange shirt. I already have a beret, so I can be LALA ORANGE from the Rainbow Brite gang. Hehehe.   it has been a weekend of kitty-cats: i am cat-sitting alana's, rocky and niles. and emily's brother rob and his fiancee just got two kittens! They are adorable. I'm pining away for a kitten now. we'll see...maybe if it works out with rob's allergies we can find a way to deal with emily's as well and then the cat house can have real cats!!!  i am extremely tired! it's time for bed.

      so, in contradiction to my response of a few blogs ago, no, it's not worth it. it's all crap and i'm destined for loneliness all my life. might as well get started on my wandering asthetic stage now.

      ah, i'm such a fool. perhaps it would be best if i just learned to accept this and then maybe things would be alright. i just hate being a fool---laughing too loud at things that aren't all that funny, acting nervous, not knowing what to say, saying dumb things, mumbling, showing off...yes, i hate this game. it's a stupid game. the trouble is, i'm either not playing or losing miserably...i never get past the first stage. when i'm not playing, i'm depressed about it; when i am playing, i hate it. dammit.

      I have a new horn!!!!  A beautiful, shiny new Edward's bass trombone...customized to my playing style and the best professional horn you could ever get! It is also one of two bass trombones in the WORLD that possesses the new and revolutionary (okay, maybe not revolutionary) "edge" bracing, which frees up the sound and feel. Which means I can't have it quite yet; they have to make another edge valve casing before they can send it to me. It's the most beautiful exciting thing in the whole wide world.   I would have to say that my experience at Edwards was the coolest thing...EVER. Christan is the man and the room is awesome, and we got free posters and hats, and I got to sign my name underneath Mark Fisher's! (Lyric Fricking Opera of Fricking Chicago) Damn. I'm still hyping on how cool that is...I want to work there, man, I want to put things together like that and meet Joe Alessi and Blair Bollinger....argh. Ah geez.   So...that's the big excitement! The other big excitement is that I'm getting my tenor slide fixed tomorrow, and it's donut-day. Mm...

      haha! i'm writing from the "communication kiosk" in the lounge. hehe. i just went to breakfast with my dad. hopefully he'll be able to come back on tuesday to take me to elkhorn to assemble a bass trombone. we'll see. it depends if christian is available and if i can switch my lesson to a different day.  hopefully chris and mike aren't too busy and can come too. we'll see.   i laughed so hard last night i almost peed my pants on numerous occasions. chris stopped by and then we went over to griffin's where some phi mu alpha guys were hanging and watching Orgazmo. (hmm...interesting) after the movie we played this horribly violent video game (i can't remember what it was called but it's mortal kombat style, kick-the-crap-out-of-your-opponent), but it was so funny....so funny. one of the characters (Yoshumitsu!) could pogo stick on his sword, and this other dude (Voldo) who reminded me uncannily of the gimp from pulp fiction in a harlequin suit could walk around on his knees. it was so fricking funny. most of the time i couldn't play effectively because i was laughing so hard. ah geez. i laugh just thinking about it. hehehe.   ah well, all this kiosking has delayed me from practicing yet again. must go , must  regain sense of motivation and desire to become a good musician. sigh.

      mikey, you're the greatest. i love you bunches. :)  very very very bad football game today. I'm sure if Babar is reading this, she's extremely happy that our cocky football team got ass-whooped by indiana...haha. it's sort of ironic. anyway, the football game sucked, but heidi, her friend megan and i stayed for the fifth quarter and then we followed the band back, skipping and dancing the whole way. it was fun. my dad is in town...we went to dinner with his friend dean, and it was interesting...well, he's my dad, what can i say. we've never exactly gotten along the greatest...yeah, either we're too alike or too different, whatever it is, we're never on the same page and we end up irritating the crap out of each other. I wish my family was closer together.  A lot of people ask me how I can come so far away for school...don't I miss my family? well...i do. but it's weird. it's more like being disconnected. but it's just the three of us and my dad and i always fight, my mom and i try our best not to let that get in the way...i'm not sure how they are together. it seems like they irritate each other a lot, as well. my dad doesn't really take me seriously...which is quite frustrating when you're trying to develop some sort of greater relationship with him and all he does is shoot you down. i wish i had siblings. i wish my extended family were bigger and closer, too...i rely on my friends so much for these reasons, and sometimes i think that's why things get so easily strained...it also makes the loneliness that much more acute. please don't worry about me though. i've learned how to handle it. :)   happy ending note: F. I think F is a happy note. I like F. Here's to F!!!

      hurray! tonight was waterpolo night at the nat. a big mutual crap-kicking contest! waterpolo rocks, it's so vicious. there's no fouling, and if you want someone to drop the ball, you just hold them underwater til they give in. it rocks. my shoulder is acting up though, which is bad. it sucks---i never had swimmer's shoulder when i actually considered myself a swimmer and swam on average 8 times a week, but now that i go like once a week it flares up. grrr. ah old age.  at any rate, i'm tired out in that good aerobic sort of way, and ready to go to bed for it's only seven and a half more hours til it's back to the nat! hurray, hurrah! hehe...yeah, i really don't want to get up at 6 tomorrow, but i chose it, i must live with it.  g'night folks.

      the problem with relationships is that, at their core, they are based on physical attractiveness. you can be with someone all the time, but it's not a "relationship" until you realize you want to sleep with them too.  you can start out liking someone for being clever or witty, and these qualities will lead more and more to you finding something in their physical appearance that makes them attractive to you.  of course, you can always start out by thinking that someone's a damn fine piece of ass, too, and then come to appreciate their more delicate qualities.   so! conversation with collin today, he intends on asking a cheerleader out on a date this weekend. "not because she's a cheerleader, because also, she's cute! and nice." cute...what a high standard to have to live up to. (by the way, mild disappointment from me but it's not like i ever expect anything from anyone anymore) i mean...on top of being witty and charming and nice i've got to be  cute,  too? oh dear. cute was an oversight in my genetic code. cute didn't get figured into the double helix and therefore has missed its mark completely. cute. bah! who needs it.   i would like to point out, so that i'm not a hypocrite, that yes, i do have expectations for cuteness in the opposite sex as well. sort of a double-edged sword. kind of painful to hold on to if you grab it in the wrong place.

      i don't understand why exactly, but tonight i just hit one of those moods...everything piled up just seems so huge all i feel like doing is bawling my eyes out. and of course everytime that happens i get lonely too and it ends up that there is inevitably no one to give hugs. or at least the right person is indisposed. as was the case tonight and good grief! i'm going insane! i dunno. fetal position sounds pretty good right now. just so.

      home! (well, second home) i have decided to devote today to the study of music, as i have not done such for several days. but first i have to get over all the obstacles in my way...grr, i can't find my barrettes, i ran out of contact solution, the kitchen smells like cooked spinach which has nearly obliterated my appetite for breakfast, even though i'm devastatingly hungry, my dress can't be exchanged....argh argh argh. oh well. i thought i would complain a little and get it out of my system.   Last night Davis Alex and I had an adventure! We trekked out to serene and historic Marshall (I have no idea if it is either, but bear with me in my attempts at dramatic effect) to witness what might be the last show I Voted For Kodos would ever do. After some minor mishaps regarding not having enough money to get in, we managed to enter this quaint little junior high gymnasium and discover that we were the oldest and most conservatively dressed kids in the room (discounting the chaperones, of course...chaperones!!! hahah). Nevertheless, Kodos put on a good show, but we left at their break because we were tired (now i do feel old). We threw some dodge balls at them from backstage first, and Alex attempted to steal Ross's bass.  We played on the (wet) playground equipment for a while (hopscotch! uneven bars! wobbly bridges!) and then headed back to boring old Madison. And that was my evening of ska-filled fun.   I realized when we walked into that gym how much I've changed since high school. Everyone looked so young. A year and a half ago I would have loved it in there. I would have been dressed the part, I would have danced the part...well, now i'm just an old college kid, with my "generic college vest" as Toby coined it, and my flat uninteresting hairdo and all that. Weird! Still, we were the envy of all the kiddies, sauntering up to the stage and saying "hi" to Nick and Ross. hehe...well, Cheers to growing up.

      I'm rereading some of my old blog archives, and I just realized two things:  1) I miss getting long thoughtful Ben emails  2)My best blogging was done when I was still in Prof Dunne's Intro to Buddhism class.   I highly recommend the week of March 18th-24th. Home of the infamous "Ryan" blog and the discussion on intersubjective samadhi. Very good stuff, if I may say so myself. I haven't been quite up to par since (and that's a shame because it was only my second week of blogging).  well...I am desperate to get back to Madison but I have to patient for another half a day. Sigh!

      a very merry thanksgiving! it has been relatively calm here at my aunt and uncle's place--good food, plenty of it. actually we went to my aunt's brother's house in Oostburg...what a name for a town! Oostburg. ha! well, Rebecca's been okay. Yesterday she threw a mirror at my head! That was kind of nifty, especially when it pegged me just below the eye. I was, surprisingly, I'm sure, incredibly displeased and therefore refused to speak to her for a while. It worked like a charm...she was a sweetheart for the rest of the evening and she even apologized! She's never done that before. At any rate, today she was a little jealous that I was playing with her other cousin Samantha, because she thought I wasn't paying attention to her. So that got a little rough. But all in all (minus the flying mirrors) she's been alright.   I've been thinking a lot about Jerry (because I miss him!) but also about relationships, and I think I need some help. I think I've forgotten how to be a girlfriend, there's been too many years between him and Dave and I can't remember.... I mean...I need to relax. And I need to find a sense of security. Of course, it's bound to be awkward in a five-days old relationship. We need to get to know each other a little better too. Project! Ha! A project. Neat-o. When I talked to my parents, they were very negative about Jerry's nose ring. But I talked to my mom the next day and she apologized and made me feel very good! I love my mom. She's a cool cat. Also, on the ironic side of things...anyone from high school remember how my crushes always seemed to have names starting with "J?" (Jon R, that one Jesse kid from US History, Jaime, etc etc)--well, here life goes and throws me a curve! This time it works out. :) What does that tell you? I dunno--we'll see.   Still having Bill troubles, but I emailed Sean, my private teacher at home, and asked him if I could call and get some advice. So that's this weekend. This entire situation is making me feel very helpless. What am I going to do if we can't resolve our issues? I'm working very hard this year, and I can actually see improvement for once in my playing, but I feel like all of this is dragging me down and it's going to hurt me in the professional long run. I just don't know what to do right now. When I emailed him and asked if we could discuss in person some of this stuff, he emailed back with "what's to discuss?" and then a long tirade on what exactly I should do next, etc. So in my reply I told him that I still think we should meet...which means I need to have my shit together before then. I can't wait to talk to Sean! He'll be a tremendous help. I wish he were my professor...he's hip (even down to wearing socks with sandals), he actually keeps up with the professional and teaching worlds and introduces new techniques to his kids, he's not old and stubborn, he's enthusiastic, his jokes aren't dumb, he buys you beer. All positives, in my book. :) Well, everyone cross your fingers for me!   Back to the world of cousin...hurray, Barbies!

      hehe. i'm posting from davis' computer! she and chris are listening to some music history stuff so they need to tie up the phone line. anyway, there will be pizza tonight! i need it. it's recovery food. recovery from not sleeping or eating very well, recovery from professor troubles (which have only gotten worse since my bitch post of 11/15), etc etc. i should be practicing my conducting stuff, i as i get to go in class tomorrow, but my little yamaha piano's speakers are busted and i can't get any sound out of it. so that sucks and it means i have to get up earlier tomorrow morning so i can warm up and practice conducting. i'm way behind in this class. i haven't done any video taping in two weeks and i hardly ever practice. i really need to go see him about assymmetrical beat patterns and cueing...but argh! it's so easy to slack. :)   ah well. this is the kind of night you just want pizza and some lovin'. well, at least there will be pizza. the lovin' is finishing his sculpture project. damn, davis' computer screen is reallly extra bright. or maybe my eyes are just tired. hurray for the babble. i wish jessie were online. i could get in some quality really tired babble right now and she'd appreciate it. where is the pizza!?!?!

      another successful trombone studio party!!! much drunkeness all around! chairs breaking! packing-peanut throwing! singing along to frank sinatra!   the two funniest things that happened all evening are probably these:  Apparently (i was not present for any of this as I was witnessing the second funny event) LJ and Davis both sat on of the kitchen chairs together, and it started to bend a little. So no one was supposed to sit on it, but Davis forget and did anyway...and it collapsed upon her! She got scared that I would be mad about it, so LJ took it outside and put it in the backyard. Sunday morning I was wandering around the kitchen when I realized that we only had three kitchen chairs...and the other was decidedly absent from all rooms of the house. I shrugged, and walked out the back door only to find the poor chair, disabled, in the grass near the cellar door.   The second funny event involves Sean O'Hara climbing into a large cardboard box and then falling over, spilling styrofoam pellets everywhere. You had to be there. It was hilarious.   There is a good deal of happiness going down in Lauren's life right now. I knew if I whined about being lonely enough someone would pick up on it. Hehe...just kidding. But, I would just like to say this: Jerry you make me very happy!

      I've always considered myself a fairly responsible and trustworthy person--i'm not usually late, i don't forget commitments, i take care of conflicts--but apparently my professor feels differently. Now, because I feel this way about myself, I react very negatively to lectures from said professor about my poor-decision making skills, especially when it is an obvious misunderstanding. I agreed to play in the orchestra concerts on Dec 6th and 8th, only to find out the next week that the 6th is also the night of our russian folk orchestra concert. Now, even though the RFO is a non-SOM group, I have been playing with them for three semesters and owe more responsibility to Victor than I do to the orchestra. Nevertheless, I have agreed to play these concerts, and they are low on trombones so my backing out would surely cause trouble. It's most likely that I can do both...the RFO gig is the CREECA christmas party and can be scheduled for earlier in the evening, which I told Bill and said that it would work out, I just had to confirm with Victor. So he angers me for jumping to conclusions and assuming that my doubts were an automatic failure to be responsible. This is on top of the fact that he just put me on the bass trombone part without asking---and hmm, let's see, if I remember correctly, we had a conversation about this way back when, oh yes, and I told Bill that I love playing bass but I am originally a tenor player. This means if he needs a bass player he should ask me, not just assume that I should do it ("because I have a horn"). I don't mind, just let me know! I'm not likely to say no, but I appreciate being consulted about which instrument I have to bring.  He's done the same thing for some trombone choir stuff...which means at our concert in december I'm going to have to haul two (2) trombones up to the capital, warm up two (2) horns, and figure out logistics of placing and storing these two (2) horns. And then I again have to haul back two (2) horns to humanities. If I played the flute or something, that'd be fine. Dandy. No worries about tired hands or stessed tendons, easy. So he damn well better give one of my horns (and it's going to be Bernard 'cause there ain't no way I'm carrying his heavy ass half a mile) a ride to the concert. Well, anyway, he's just so adept at pissing me off. I'm not sure what I'm going to do to stay sane for the next three semesters. Maybe I'll take my out jury one semester early....  My basic concern here is:  It would be extremely easy for me to get out of the RFO concert. Victor's a pussycat...he has another contrabass player who is pretty solid on his notes and it's not like I'm all that great. But i don't want to back out. As long as I've been taking responsibility for my own shit, running into a conflict has meant that I give in to the commitment I'm more afraid of breaking rather than the one that is most important to me. And I always feel terrible about it. Well, learn from your mistakes! I don't want to give in this time. I will feel much better about my capability to be a functioning and responsible adult-type person.

      good morning! i've been thinking, and i feel pretty calm today. So:  I would like to make a formal apology for my behavior of the last five or so days. Especially for yesterday. Yesterday all that anxiousness and happiness and worry and everything else caught up to me and I freaked. I panicked. And it is totally undeserving. I've realized that if you go around so worked up you lose your appetite (no matter how hungry you are) everytime food is put in front of you, you start to go a little insane. It also makes you hungrier. :) I've realized that if you go around with your hopes on frickin' Mars (as mine have been), you're setting yourself up for a lot of disappointment, heartbreak not the least of these.  I've realized that the games are all inside  my  head, and no one else's. I've realized that it's time to relax and roll with what happens...no matter how far away it may seem.   Does that sound healthier? I would imagine so. And I bet this sounds even better:  it's time to go eat some breakfast. :)

      again, with the games! again, with me always finding something to be stressed out or anxious about!   i'm playing a game of two-person tag (as he has confirmed he is playing), and i chased the other person around and around and tagged him, he's it! and he sat down under a tree and went to sleep. nice time for a nap when lauren's emotions are all in turmoil! arhahahgrhaargh. okay, i must stop panicking. it's a busy week, boys are slow, there's lots of reasonable excuses. all the games are in my head. i guess what makes it hardest for me is that when i see him he acts very nonchalant about everything and that forces me into an attitude of coolness as well, and so it goes (except for today when i spilled water all over myself). this is saying that i see him frequently which is not true, i've only seen him twice since friday. that too, is driving me insane. Jerry you are driving me insane!!!!!!!!! aaaaaaaaahhh!!!  patience is a virtue, but impatience is a talent, and i have perfected it.

      a very merry tuesday buddha stewers! i'm rather tired--i keep waking up around 3 am and not being able to go back to sleep for a long time, but miraculously this might be the first time all year i've been able to get in a nap. brass quintet has been cancelled as mikey has a jazz band gig, so i have plenty of time to chill out, practice, etc...and there's water polo tonight! there hasn't been h2o polo in many weeks. hangin' with the nat cats, yeee-ah. which means i can nail down arwen on a time to come over for tea. now that i actually have something exciting to talk about.   okay, so i just found a staple in my keyboard. what? a staple? who's been dropping staples in my keyboard? grr...  congratulations, grant, on making the concerto finals!   nap time mmm mm mm. :)

      Lauren's Senseless but Still Very Exciting News for Today, November 11:   I have officially named both my tenor and my bass trombones! My bass is named Bernard (said with a little Jaja Gabor type accent--swallow the r and stress the d), and my tenor Bianca. Now, someone might think...hmm, that sounds familiar, and then you'll go and pull out your copy of Disney's  The Rescuers  and say, "hey! Bernard and Bianca!!! Hey!!" and you'll be right, because yes, my trombones were named after two cartoon mice. Not for any specific tribute to the movie, which I haven't seen in...oh...seven years or so. Bernard got his name first, and it has a little more meaning at the moment...it's paying homage to good old RB High and it's alliterative (Bernard the Bass Bone). Bianca...well, that just came to me yesterday when I was spending a little quality time with her (she's been feeling a little neglected lately, as I adjust to Bernard) and I realized that in the movie, Bernard and Bianca are lovers. Well, I want my trombones to get along well (with me in the middle), so I figured that it was perfect!! Bianca has to get used to it...she's been nameless (and, frankly, sexless) for so long, but I think she likes it and it'll all be good.   now, not every musician names their instrument.  I realize how crazy this all sounds. But i think we should love our horns and use them as friends and extensions of our music. anyway, i do think it's kind of nuts but i like it. I'm very proud of my names. Bernard and Bianca.

      Good Morning! I decided to get rid of my comment function. I don't think it was working right and plus it looked really bad. So if you want to talk to me you'll have to do it the old fashioned way, email. (hehe)  needless to say, i'm feeling pretty happy. schmurific. mahvelous. and sort of sick to my stomach too, in that pleasant kind of way. Neat. Perhaps I will get out to JC Penney today. This will require some doing. I hope I don't have to take the bus. But...it's all right because this is turning out to be a very very good weekend because I hardly have anything planned!! No football game, I don't have to play in master class on monday, no SAI meeting (although the party last night was very very fun)...the only thing I really have to do is work, and that's alright (even though Brian isn't there tomorrow and therefore I can't be amused by his random thoughts on cribbage playing) because I like work. I even got to sleep as long as I wanted to today! that hasn't happened on a saturday since summer. So for once, a weekend as it was meant to be, relaxing. I think we are having a "chill" tonight. Our house gets volunteered for a lot of chills, it seems. The more the merrier!  In perfect honesty I think I should stop writing because all I can string together this morning are little choppy sentences that betray no sort of emotion, even though there is a good deal of (happy) emotion wreaking havoc inside of me. So....perhaps I should go do some practicing. :)

(we're all thinking positive thoughts on this one) hopefully this will not be another Jon Rathsam experience and I will not get rejected for a family film festival.  wish me luck!!!!

      before i start to bitch and moan i will have to say that today was the BEST football game i've ever been too. the crowd was loud as all hell, the wave got all the way to the reverse (split didn't work out so well), we were sitting 20 rows up from the field and i could see everything that was happening in the band, and the game was interesting for once...and we kicked ass! hurray! so that's good. the rest of the evening has been a little rocky.   i got home from sai intending to hang with abby, but she forgot about a prior commitment so had to back out. so i started to wash the dishes, which proved to be a near disaster...i dropped five plates and the cake pan all at once and there was chocolate and soup everywhere. and for some reason this just made me snap...suddenly i felt very angry and very lonely and i didn't know what to do. i needed to talk to someone. so i called mikey and chris, hoping one at least would go to the jazz jam with me. nobody home! alex calls for davis, few minutes later davis comes home, etc. alex davis and i go to jazz jam, yay, some good laughs. watch e.t. with grant and emily. chris shows up, falls asleep. time for bed now...still need to talk to someone but no-one is ever around any more. i hate pushing my problems on people but i hate being alone and upset more. i don't know what to do. i'm very tired of all this, lauren's vicious cycle of self-defeat. not sure how to get it to stop though. i miss bethany. i miss emily and davis. i suppose that's life though. why do people grow apart? don't we love one another? i love my friends so much (the soft-spots around my heart) i think it is my downfall...is there such a thing as loving too deeply?

      the party is over! tonight we threw a surprise party for Alex (happy birthday baby!) and now I am all by myself! (tis the way it always is) emily is at grant's and davis is at alex's. so. it was a fun night, though. not the usual crowd, but fun! there was wrestling and sex book talk and jokes and all the good stuff that makes a party sweet. so....now it's definitely time to go to bed, because i'm going to the game with kathryn and heidi tomorrow and we're meeting for breakfast at 9:30 (yuck!)!!  So I will swallow up all the lonely empty houseness i am feeling and put that energy into sleeping. hurrah.

      hurray! seeing nat'ly and jessie tonight, much happiness here. also we are going to disneyland on thursday. rock on! disneyland with nat and jess is my favorite thing in the whole wide world. almost. well, close. it's pretty damn fun, anyhow.   okay so the half-nekkid picture of jason is no longer gracing the internet, ah well, it certainly was something to see. (top half, just so you're not creeped out) my return date to madison is getting earlier and earlier. i keep realizing things: oh yeah rent's due on the 15th, the phone bill around then too, we need to find a house pronto, davis is lonely, i miss her and jerry and everyone, and on and on. also home has been rather uninteresting, parents are driving me insane, only childness is driving me insane. at school it's nice to live with friends.  divertisment , if you will. at home it's parents. parents are not letting go. it's getting rather rough but perhaps i can handle it for a few more weeks. we'll see. nevertheless, i will sacrifice sun and warm weather for a little madison style fun. :)

      good thing to do when bored:  go to google.com, type in the name of someone you know, and see what happens. You can find many amazing things. For instance, how many of you knew that Mike Zens is a bodybuilder? And that Sean O'Hara is a horticulturist, tattoo artist,  and  former race car driver? And that there is a half-nekkid picture of Jason Hausback floating around on the internet? And don't forget that Chris McGann is an ace reporter in Seatle! Hehe. yes. This is excellent entertainment. I highly recommend it.

      doo do doo do doo  there is very little to entertain me in my house. i must get out! OUT! hehe. well, i'm sick of reading and watching tv, and you can only do so many puzzles (besides, my fingers get cold)...well, yeah. and of course there are the ponderances, the little negative thoughts (i think i scared jerry a bit with those...but, what else are you going to think about when you have nothing to do?)...sigh. i should call megan. it was proposed that we all go ice skating tonight. sounds neat. hope it happens.   kt and i went to borders yesterday, and i blew my gift card on lots and lots of cds. good stuff. i am especially excited about The Beta Band and my Prokofiev symphonies (all seven, rock). so now i have some new music to replenish my stale old collection.   hmm. yep, even i'm boring. i can't even entertain myself. well, sheeet.

      Hm. what to say?   Well, first off, a big welcome home to me, as i made it without adventure from madison to san diego. since i got home so soon before christmas, there hasn't been much adventure to make up for it, either. hung out with megan sarah and mary on sunday night...much fun. i was mercilessly grilled about jerry. my mom did the same the next day. we went shopping--i got some new clothes, which i needed, and some cds, which i wanted, and all is good. lunch at oscars. mm, mm, yummy. pretty tame christmas, well, it is my family after all, and we're never anything but sullen or grumpy when in the same room together. it's fun. or not. I got a gift card to Borders, though, which i am very excited about and will probably spend all of within the next couple of days. i need new music, desperately. i've got some: jerry gave me a john coltrane compilation, i bought a chris thomas king cd (although not the one i was thinking i wanted) yesterday, the soundtrack to Oh Brother and (St) Coltrane's Giant Steps I bought in the airport, and today I got Herbie Hancock's Maiden Voyage as a "present" (i picked it out). So maybe I will be less dissatisfied with my music collection now that it has been refreshed a bit. Excellent.   I was disappointed by LotR. As accurate as it was to the book, and as impressive the visuals, there was something missing. Or maybe there was too much. I can't decide. I must have read those books at least 18, 19 times. It's fixed in my imagination as this giant, this behemoth of a magical world...and of course everyone's imagination works different ways. So maybe the creators missed my boat but have delighted someone else. Probably. I'm kind of a snob about the books I read. I think, especially for a classic of literature such as Tolkien's work, you should read the book before you let the movie put the pictures in your head. So some of the people in the theatre annoyed me...the little "what's going on?" and "that was the end?" comments floating around...grr! But I do think it's funny that some people have still failed to understand that it's a TRILOGY, which means, oh yes you lucky audience you, you get THREE films instead of just one. No, the story doesn't end with Sam and Frodo wandering off into Mordor...there is much much much more to come...Well, I suppose I'm being crabby about it. READ THE BOOKS, PEOPLE!  I mean it. I really really mean it. This is important. READ THE BOOKS. Don't rely on the media to shape your conception of things. break free. the greatest tool you have is your ability to create your own impressions, to come away with your own understanding. This is why you read, this is why you let your mind work toward entertaining you rather than sitting for hours in front of a tv screen, a glutton of images and sounds...interact with the world. live it.   i suppose i could also argue that reading books has led me to spend many hours curled up in a chair, rejecting social responsiblities, causing me to be somewhat crabby about having to, oh say, put the book down to go eat dinner...and what am i doing now, after all? just sitting in front of a screen which also feeds me information and images painlessly without requiring much thought, rambling. Well...I have nothing to say to that. :)

      Just discovered something interesting. Well, interesting, rather ironic, and, if you wish to interpret it so, somewhat symbolic. It is this:  On October 7th I posted the cryptic messages "Is it worth it" and "Yes, it is worth it, but only if I am not shy about it" in reference to my inner struggle about Jerry being resolved (I had on that day decided I would like him, come what may). October 7th is Ryan's birthday. What can we take out of this? Or is Lauren, having read perhaps too many books and having, perhaps, too much time to think, overanalyzing this coincidence? After all, she had recovered from the Ryan-mishap a good two months before. I would like, for the record, to take this as conclusive evidence that all emotional holes caused by the previously mentioned boy have been healed over and filled. Much satisfaction here. We at 510 N Henry #1 are all very happy about this, and, therefore, have cause to celebrate.

      I have been brainstorming for quite some time as to how I should update/improve/revitalize Buddha Stew. And I have realized that Madison is sucking up my creative energy and that any changes I make must wait until I get home and have way to much time on my hands. The problem is that Buddha Stew has lost its buddha stewiness and is, therefore, quite uninteresting and definitely not at all thought provoking. I guess there's only so much you can say about weather and how great you think your boyfriend is. What happened to the rants! The angst! The  poshlost !  The discussions of intersubjective samadhi and buddhist meditation! Sigh. The fact is, I have become your Jane-average college girl living a generally happy existence. And no stupid or weird things have happened to me lately so I can't even rant about that. Grr. What shall I do, faithful readers? Not-so-faithful readers? First-time comers?   So, I guess I will have to be patient, and, if I get home ("if" being used in this context to dramatize the current state of my plane ticket, which is "lost") perhaps I will have some great adventure to relate. We shall see. Patience, patience my dears.

      mucking around on the internet, when i should be studying i guess, well maybe i'm taking a break, yeah, let's say that.   so far it looks like my gpa might go up this semester, but then again i haven't taken my african final nor has my conducting/pedagogy grade been posted. but at least it won't suck. :) and my dad will be happy and i go about my business not really worrying about things. gpa! i shudder to think that my musical achievement can be graded. that means holding me up to a standard of general musical achievement and i certainly can't attest to any sort of greatness or excellence in the matter. my musical achievement is monstrously slow. grr.   hans is asking me difficult questions again, so i must devote my thinking time to that. toodles.

      They should make all universities and colleges have uniform holiday breaks.

      Happy Birthday Frank Sinatra!  Tonight Jerry Abby Tony and I went to see the play that Douglas was stage managing. "Two Words, Confusing," and it was very very funny. Highly enjoyable. I don't really have anything more to say about it. Which is no offence to the play or Doug, of course, but more of a "shit i'm really very tired and my eyes hurt" sort of thing.   I feel like it's Friday. I wish it were Friday! Then classes would be over and we would have finally had our BQ "recital" and I could start drinking. And maybe I'd have more than ten minutes of time alone with Jerry. Yeah, that'd be nice. Humph. I've pretty much got everything finished, work-wise, so now I'm just sitting around waiting for everyone else to be done, and it's turning out to be awfully boring. There is quite a bit of thinking/studying I have to do for African Storyteller...but I think I can put most of it off until the weekend is over. Until my jury on Monday is over, actually.   I really really really really want to eat a pizza right now. I've been smelling pizza off and on for about 5 hours and it's driving me insane. Because I want a pizza. now. Unfortunately I am ALL ALONE and there is no one who will split the cost of a pizza with me. Sigh. C'est la vie. Perhaps instead I will eat....ah hell, there's nothing that would satisfy me as much as a pizza would. Damn.

      Howdy all Today was a pretty excellent day, if I may say so. It's not like anything amazing happened, or anything funny, but it just remains in my mind as being rather good.  I was thinking that perhaps I should notice this more, as opposed to walking around in my cloud of grumpiness and not taking pleasure in the smaller things.   So what was so good about today, you ask? Well, just a few things. 1)Last day of trombone choir 2)I finished my conducting video tape 3)I actually got through all the stuff I needed to practice for the first time in...oh, two weeks and... 4)I saw NATE DOGG at the Nat tonight. It rocked. I haven't seen him since July. He still owes me a beer or two though, for that bike accident incident. Hehe. Good times! Nate! I hope he comes back and works more next semester. There need to be more conversations like the lettuce one. Confused? You'll probably find the answer in a blog from late June/early July. Nate kicks a lot of ass. While I was at the nat I also swam a 100 freestyle in 1:14...which considering my out of shapeness, is not too bad! It's only 12 seconds or so more than what I used to do in high school. I was pretty impressed. Y'all should be too. :)  So all in all I am satisfied with my Monday Dec 10th experience. I don't really have much more to say about that...so, I shan't, but perhaps I will pop on over to Top Five and post something new....  happy tuesday!

      I am now part of a prestigious new drum midwest drum corps! Check out the link at left--it's the 2308 University 12th Lancers! We rock. I'm part of the tenor line and I just have to say:  DRUMLINE RULES! hehe. Now I can be a dick and smoke a lot of pot and disrespect the directors. Of course this is all drummer stereotyping I have carried over from high school and is not true at all of the very diligent and respectable people that make up the country's drumlines. I get to make my own quad set...I'm looking for a bunch of randomly sized coffee cans. I have (chop)sticks and Buster wrote me a solo! Oh yeah. Lancers are the coolest. Go check it out...positions are filling up fast. :)  Friday night and not much to do...not much sleep last night so I took a three hour nap this afternoon and then sat through an hour and a half of the trumpet departmental...both of which have made me feel very much in need of physical activity. Emily and I are considering having a dance party.   Speaking of physical activity, today in BQ Mikey and I invented a new sport. It involves throwing an object at a person with a trashcan on their head, and they have to catch it in the trashcan. I'm not sure what we're going to call it, but believe you me, this new sport will have taken the nation by storm before you know it. Oh yes, just you wait.

      Well, inexplicably, I got sick yesterday and have spent the past day and a half moaning and feeling miserable...taking the afternoon off currently (although I have to go back to humanities for this &#$@** symphony rehearsal) and have actually accomplished some things. I watched Sleeping Beauty and read my pedagogy book and picked out my two pieces for conducting on thursday. So maybe being sick won't put me back as far as I thought it would. Still, my jury piece is in bad shape (or rather, I'm in bad shape...not only am I sick and have terrible high range anyway, I also split my lip last night in the middle of a particularily violent sneeze. grr) and I cancelled my rehearsal with Scott...hmm, well, next week shouldn't be too bad. I just have to get my conducting video done and all is good. And finals week can start and end and then I can go home!!!  Jerry stopped in unannounced last night, to see how I was, and made me feel tons better. Thanks kiddo! :)

      hello! :) :)  yes, it was a marvelous evening! dinner was good, the dance itself was extremely fun (entertainment provided by ian and chase), jerry looked very sexy and i had no major dress mishaps (the only mishaps relating to my shoes).    jerry showed up at 6:30 for dinner with the other kids at 7, there was some confusion and lateness getting to the restaurant but it all worked out. made it to the dance around 10:30 (still recurring lateness) and proceeded to boogie! jerry and i made up a whole bunch of dances...our version of flamengo dancing took the floor by storm, i'm sure. the dj was a little...well, dorky, but he played fun music for the most part...although it's not hard to make dancing to lame music fun.  i'll honestly say it was the most fun i've ever had at a dance! thank god high school is behind us. :)  afterwards we went over to abby's and watched the end of the Labrynth, and walked back to my place. we were both tired so we curled up in my bed and stayed that way until 1:30 this afternoon...  well, i don't know what else to say. happy? you betcha, bucky. ;)

      jerry is being difficult. he doesn't mind me walking a few blocks in the shitty weather, snow/rain/ice crap, oh but if i ask him to do it, ooooh watch out.  besides, i go there all the time, and i don't feel particularily comfortable there (just, "the girlfriend" to the roomates) so i'm a bit tired of it. okay, and the fact that i've only just now gotten home (after putting in a marathon day: two power lectures, 4 hours of practice, errands, etc) makes me not want to leave so much. so i'm just venting a bit and i know he's going to read this (hey sugar) and he had a long day too, of course, so it's all in good fun. but i need a back massage and who better? hehe...  debating whether or not to attend the movie fun at abby's tonight...on the one hand good social fun, on the other i'm beat and i want to get up a little earlier to practice tomorrow. it's also, as i mentioned, very shitty outside. cuddling sounds good. a book and some warm blankets. we shall see...

      difficult desicion to make: to waterpolo or not to waterpolo?  pros (5):  exercise; good semi-clean fun (it's never waterpolo unless you absolutely cream someone or hold them underwater mercilessly whilst your team scores a point); chance to see people i don't have shifts with this semester; an opportunity to leave the house, humanities building, and any other places/feelings i need to escape; gives me a free week of not-swimming  cons (4):  it's too cold to bike, and the bus is a pain in the ass and won't get me home until near 11; if i don't get home until 11 I won't have much time to do anything else that evening (incl. spend time with jerry); promised myself I would swim every other day anyway; i'm feeling lazy  so, i think it's defintely in favor of going, and the bus issue makes me want to bike anyway, although i'm afraid that i'll freeze my ass off if i do and be crabby anyway. why couldn't it have stayed nice for just a few more days? ah, wisconsin, i have two words for you: you suck. figure out your weather patterns and then get back to me.

      okay, i know most of my blogs have been pretty bitchy and/or sad recently, but really, i'm alright. it's easier to talk about things you are upset about...well, anyway i feel pretty terrible today. i'm worried. jerry and i had a great great great time last night, much happiness, many smiles...i would be all warm and glowing about that today but i'm worried. and i had these dreams last night, they were all about rejected love and depression...one was so realistic i woke up and nearly started crying...in it jerry had to think about something and we went to bed and he couldn't sleep so he got up and started writing poetry...which was all about me. I woke up and tried to read some of it, and it was beautiful, sublime, but it was all written on balloons (analyze that) and he was systematically popping each one and as I read the one I was holding, all the words about me turned into past tense and I realized he was trying to get rid of me, so I started begging him to tell me what was wrong...all he said was "no, this wasn't real, you're just my secretary" (okay, that was kind of weird but in the dream i freaked out about it) and that's when I woke up. And it took me a good long time to realize that it wasn't real, and that jerry was still there beside me and everything was okay. I hope. I hate my goddammed subconscious. It takes a minor worry and makes it into the end of the world. And now I'm just terribly preoccupied about everything and the last thing I want to do is go practice, although it's one of the things I'm worried about, and oh yeah, I might have lost the pool keys today at work, which is NOT GOOD AT ALL and dammit I'm just fucking up everything today.   It is time for a fuck of frustration and worry:  FUCK!   if i had the proper html knowledge to make that any bigger, I would.

      will our apartment-hunting woes never end?   we are having much trouble finding a place. especially in the gilman street area...it is just frustratingly difficult. the first place we wanted was taken not hours before we got there with the sufficient funds, the second place we didn't even get to look at, and the other two places we've checked out are total shitholes. davis and i have been frantically calling rental places and setting up apointments and negotiating costs and trying to figure out just what the hell we're going to do. now we're thinking, what's around in three bedroom that two people can share (davis and i don't mind)? the probably i have is, i really want to live in the area we are now. i love it. it's pretty and calm and close to the lake and state street and it just makes me happy. of course, right now i just want a place to live, i want to stop worrying, blah blah blah. so sunday there is a showing at a house on west dayton, which isn't so bad, it's cheap and not far away. so we'll see. arrrgh. hoping this will be settled by the end of next week...

      i was going along, minding my only business, happy as a clam, and then out of nowhere this really shitty mood descended and took over my whole day and made it one big fucked-up experience. It's all the fault of that damn Kopprasch exercise. Why can't I frigging do it? What the hell is wrong with me? I'll bet everyone other college trombonist in the world can do it. I bet they can do it without thinking about it. So why can't I? does it mean I suck? does it mean I shouldn't be playing trombone? What the hell!?!?!?! On top of this I found out that I'm playing nothing but second parts once again in Wind ensemble, and it makes me really not want to be there anymore. I can't stand it. I don't want to go. I'm tired and I'm sick of music. I don't want to deal with Smith. I don't want to sit in my chair and feel like I'm the least hardworking player in the school. I don't want to think about how I am or am not progressing. I don't know how I will handle this...  and all this suffering (ah, but a buddhist would say, "suffering is not innate") has left me wanting to do one thing, and one thing only: lie on a couch with jerry and not think about anything except being in someone's arms and being comfortable. no worries. and it is not to be!!! because of course he has a life and doesn't need me to feed him (even though sometimes i wonder about that) and will find his own dinner even though that was only an excuse to get to see him and to feel a little bit better. and i've lost my resolve to make anything to eat myself... and i have to go to the library and read for renaissance. shit. i get to feeling sometimes that i'm going to be totally overwhelmed by all the stuff i have to do, even though it's totally doable and not hard, it just requires organization and perserverence, but all my head wants to do is let things slide, fuck 'em and take a nap. i am a slacker in a bad mood.   not a good combination.

      First day of classes! Already swamped with things to do and remember, but other than that I think my classes are great and that my schedule will allow me to do and remember these things I am swamped with. :)  Renaissance Music with Crook is going to be intense, I think...but fun. Brandon is back! And in my class! That is excitement right there. Prof Dunne already pulled out the chair metaphor in Buddhism...but I think this class will be cool because it is much smaller and there will be more discussion and personal attention and stuff. It made me sort of giddy to be in class with him again, because he is absolutely frigging hilarious weird. I don't know if I can describe it...but damn, he's funny. He made us introduce ourselves to another class member, which I appreciated because then I didn't have to do it myself...since I didn't know anyone who was going to keep me awake? Hehe...but now I know at least one person, so it's all good.   Had a lesson with Bill...actually just the first lesson chat session, so we went over stuff I want to do this semester and what we're working on. So far so good. He gave me some good feedback on the grad schools I'm thinking about, and said he would put me in touch with the professors at UCLA and Colorado and would help me out with UA. So now I know two people who can help me in at UCLA...Sean's got connections there too, of course. I've decided I want to look into a place that has a good history program, too, because despite all my fighting it in high school, I'm realizing that I really really really love history. Especially music history. So I'm going to talk to Crook about that, too.   What else? Many things to do..I have to start thinking about new member recruitment for SAI, and planning out my recital (gotta call vince fuh), and living for next year...if we get the money soon we'll be able to get the place we want...on Carroll, four bedrooms big bathroom huge porch...so here's hoping for that. Gotta go order some music...I think I'll do that right now...hehe.

      i have many many words floating around in my head right now, but expressing them feels wrong to me. i guess that's just a long winded way to say that i feel overly thoughtful and reserved this evening.  "it all comes from reading the right sort of books" as c.s. lewis would say.

      Jennii asked me to inform those interested that her adventures in Prague will be updated at this website: http://www.littlegiraffe.blogspot.com, instead of at her regular site. enjoy!  I fail to understand why I am so pissy tonight. I hate being pissy. I alienate everyone. I think that the combination of there being nothing to do....and there again being nothing to do has driven me insane. All I've done for the past four nights is watch movies. I don't want to watch any more movies. The daytime is fine, I go practice, I run errands, I read. But nighttime makes me restless and I want to be out and socializing and having a good time. It's just not working. So I get pissy and I offend people and then I want to cry and I have no notion of what will make me feel better, except to socialize, but oh yeah, I alienated everyone so that won't work. Then I get pissy again. Then I get mad at people that are just there, had nothing to do with my pissiness, but maybe they could do something to make it better but they aren't, because it's not their fault and they don't feel they have to do anything to make me feel better. You see, it's all one big vicious cycle and it SUCKS ASS. I really want school to start. I don't want to have to be burdened with the responsibility of having to come up with something to do every evening. Weekends are easy. But weekdays during non-school times, that's hard. Grr. Argh. Grrrr.   Okay, maybe I'll just sit on my bed and stare at the ceiling. Anyone who feels like calling is perfectly welcome to and I will be glad to hear from you. Otherwise, do have a good night and enjoy it pissiness-free.

      gorgeous today! if tomorrow is so (and it probably will be) marisa and i are going to torrey pines to do some hiking. i am definitely needing some exercise. nat jess and i went to see beauty and the beast on the IMAX in irvine. It was big. and pretty. and loud. very enjoyable. many laughs, because they are my girls. tonight we are mini-golfing, with some other people (jonny! :). i went and got checked up on at the mouth-surgeon place today, and everything is fine, but they gave me a little syringe thing to "clean out my holes." i'm sorry, but the phrase "clean out my holes" just sounds bad. baaaad. i keep hitting this one spot when i brush my teeth and it starts bleeding. it's obnoxious. i would like it to stop. anyway, apparently i have to do mouth exercises or something to make sure i can get my mouth fully open again. this is what i gathered. he didn't exactly say this, but it was implied. hmmm...okay, commence opening and closing jaw as far as possible...now. strrrrretch...and close. strrrrrretch...and close. hehe..this reminds me of that silly article in redbook (which i was only reading to pass time in the lobby of the mouth-guy, mind you) about how women can strengthen their vaginas (PC muscles) to guarrantee better orgasm. hmm..no, i am not going to demonstrate!! heh heh heh. oooh people are so silly. so silly. i love it.   well, i ought to go "clean out my holes." go read about how tara is going to war against her toaster. tis funny.

      I am highly entertained by Adam, Megan and Tara's webposts for today. I laughed aloud at each of them. Especially Adam's and the line "which just goes to prove that my house was built on top of a meth lab." Maybe y'all won't find them as funny. But I still recommend them.   Marisa and I went out to lunch and both realized the same thing: we are having a perfectly normal and happy time (well I am when I have enough painkillers) at home, except when we get on the phone/internet with our significant others back at school. That's when the missing depression hits. Weird. Take it as flattery, boys.

      So in keeping with the posts on social disorders I have come to the conclusion that I am cursed, and what I am cursed with is this: I love people too deeply.  Because I love so deeply I worry. I worry that I am not enough. I worry that it is not mutual. I have put people up on pedestals because they are so special to me I must worship them in my secret heart of hearts. But There! I have put them up so high they have to look down on me and I am diminished. There is less of me! They are so special they have no need of me. But I need to be needed! (or do I?) They are on the pedestal, I am on the ground looking up, and crying because I am not special. I want to be special. Isn't there something about me unique or different that someone can love? I am flawed and ignorant and selfish. Does anyone else worry that they are not enough?   Because I cannot see myself go through life, my actions and my judgements, I cannot know how I appear to other people. I can only try to be what I value most in others: compassionate. It is not easy to see that the good outweighs the bad. It is not easy to be without thinking, it is not easy to think without feeling. May I be granted the wisdom to know where I am going, and if I do not, may I be granted the strength to accept what lies in my path.

      hehe..i have this little patch of skin on my chin that doesn't have any feeling in it. it's gone to sleep. it's weird. this is by far the only enjoyable side effect of the whole tooth ordeal. *poke, poke* yep, no chin feeling. hehehe  watched wonderful reruns of oldskool Nickelodeon game shows today, Finder's Keepers and Guts and Figure it Out and so forth. Took Jessie to work and then Natalie and I entertained her by dancing around to the kid songs on the Zany Brainy radio. It was much entertainment, except for the fact that the reason I was loopy was because pain was overtaking my head and making my ears want to explode. And Natalie had only just woken up. We were an excellent pair. Now she and Dan are coming over to watch some movies, so it should be a good time.   So yah, everything else is pretty lame. My dad and I are going to the symphony on thursday night, which should be a good time. They are "testing out" new music directors, so they have the candidates give concerts...this one is some canadian guy and they are playing Rach 2 and Beethoven 3. It should be a good show, I'm looking forward to it. Still I am looking forward to Sunday. I think I am driving Jerry crazy online. I am driving myself crazy. Everything is crazy. Even my dreams are crazy. Crazy fucked-up. (lauren bursts into popular Britney Spears song and starts dancing around in a weird factory restaurant thing with Melissa Joan Hart)

      ah....talking to jerry on the phone has made me feel a bit more lively and antsy, so now i feel like i ought to do something tonight, even though i still look like a chipmunk and can't chew or open my mouth very wide. :) unfortunately i missed katie! i thought she was going back to school tomorrow, but i think i had her confused with someone else, or just confused in general.but she's gone already. sigh. i want to be gone!  marisa wants to do something, i know...well, i should find something to do instead of watching tv again. we'll see.   davis, your page is down. how come?

      again, for lack of anything better to do other than putting ice packs on my cheeks, I have organized my website. The links to my friend's pages are now in alphabetical order, and I have added Jerry's website of silly poetry whether he likes it or not. :) Tara also is creating a website so i am anticipating this arrival as well.   feeling pretty good today, minus the random spells of dizziness and nausea, even though i look terrible. one of my cheeks is more swollen than the other. it's kind of neat, kind of not really. eating is only slightly easier, and i'm still sticking to soups and applesauce. supposedly tomorrow is the last day of swelling so maybe then i can go out in public. we'll see. for now it's nice to sit around and demand things of my parents and not get yelled at for it :) ah, yes, tis excellent, this invalid life...

      my dad got fired from his job at jackinthebox today. for no good reason, other than that his bosses didn't like him. hurray for california and employment at will. it's weird. i'm not worried but it didn't seem like something that would ever happen. i was more worried back in sixth grade when the e. coli scare was happening. it seems that i get less worried about things the older i am. that doesn't make sense to me, because the more you know about something, the more you understand the consequences. then again, maybe it does make sense, because you know that there are more options and it doesn't seem so much like the end of the world. i dunno. i've stopped worrying about stuff that isn't small enough. :) i'll still be able to go to school and all that. maybe i'll pay more of the rent. that's not so bad. i have two jobs, and for both of them i get a raise this coming semester because the university is cool like that. i don't worry about money. i can live without things. it's just surreal. then it gets me wondering. i think i should understand all this stuff. all this how to make it in the real world stuff. i can't forsee myself being terribly rich and famous; my trombone skills aren't good enough for that, but then again i just want to be happy somewhere. i had an idea the other day. for a radio station that plays a greater mix of "classical" (and i would come up with a new term for that) music, not just the stuff everyone knows or is the most relaxing. i think that would be fun. maybe i can be a professor. i like music history...what am i going to go to grad school for? who knows. it's hard to believe that i can make it as a performer in anything but Podunk Symphony Orchestra, with all the competition out there. I want to be in a brass quintet, most of all. But I wouldn't mind doing whatever, as long as it was with music. as long as i could be a part of the family...that's what i love best about music, it ties everyone who does it together. look at all my friends at school! only one or two aren't in music school.   i guess the thought here is, i don't really see myself being successful, but successful in the sense that i have a lot of money and respect or whatever. money and security and tax forms and health insurance...i will do all these things, but i won't worry about them. it is of no importance to me. now i'm remembering the essay i wrote for my UC applications, way back when...all about "the path least travelled" and how "i'll never do anything if it doesn't make me happy." i still believe it. it's been a bit buried lately, but i still believe it. and now i have a definition of happiness...yeah, i think i can figure this life thing out, it just takes a little time and a lot of patience. no worries, i've got both.

      arrgh. mouth surgery. curse its bloody name. i have just had my wisdom teeth removed, and now i am recovering. it all went well but as per usual my mouth will not stop with the blood and the drool and it is making me a little nauseous. guaze is annoying. and it tastes bad. but oh well. now hopefully i can avoid all types of surgery for a good long time to come.   yesterday at disneyland we all had a blast. it goes up on my top disney trips. "Day of the Running Gag"...good times. I bought some stuff, which I don't usually do, but oh well, we can all break rules the day before mouth surgery. I guess I should probably go put some more cold packs on my chipmunk cheeks. more when i am feeling up to it. :)

We sent each other those very IM messages...AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME!!!!! That is FUCKING WEIRD, man! We should start a cult or something. I mean, how many people use the phrase "i'm going to hit the hay" in the first place? No, this is spooky. SPOO-KY. Spooky. Whew. How will I be able to sleep?!?

      most entertaining moment for today, january 2nd, 2002:  arwen offroading in the target parking lot.   we had just spent half an hour laughing at the mini drama occuring on the other side of the glass inside the cold stone creamery. having three 16 year old girls getting bitched out by their thirtysomething tight-shorts wearing male boss is quite a show. cause for enjoyment were also the car show-offs in the parking lot:  the guy with his car too lowered to go over the speed bumps, and the guy joyriding in a van...hanging out the opening sliding door. so for her own showing off, arwen drives her brother's car over the little grassy knoll in front of her parking spot. four wheel drive, baby. ahhh yee-ah.   this is entertainment folks: high school kids. who needs tv with them around?

      this week went friggin fast. and this isn't just a "wow, i can't believe how fast this week went" sort of thing. i'm feeling like i stepped into some sort of time continuum in which i couldn't feel the passage of days and then stepped out and all of the sudden it was thursday night. i mean, posting on sunday seems like i did it yesterday. and it's not like things haven't been happening this week that would make it slower or more memorable. i had a concert on tuesday, steve mead was here wowing us all with his euphonium genius...it's crazy but it makes my head spin. i'm feeling better---my stomach is still upset a bit but not so much as the past couple of days. now, my head hurts because i don't really know what's going on with jerry and i want to--but he's been awfully pensive and i'm worried. i don't know if he wants to hang tonight or not but either way he needs to let me know what's going through his head so i can relax, so we both can relax and enjoy each other's company again.  today also i felt like a raving grocery/housecleaning bitch and i didn't mean to be, so i'm sorry davis. everything is frustrating me right now and it is coming out in small stupid things. on a good note my high range is much improved today. but that's about it. i'm tired and i'd like a hug and a smile from jerry just so i know that everything's going to be swell.

      weird sort of sick day. i felt really dizzy for a long time and now my stomach hurts. but it's also hungry, bleh.   spring break plans have finalized! Jerry and I (and possibly Grant and Emily) are going to Chicago for a few days to see the sights (jerry has to go to an art show for one of his classes) and relax. We're staying at the Murphy's place, and even though they aren't going to be in town they are letting us use their house. They rock! And Jerry's getting his car from home for the week,so we are all set! Looking forward to it, although not too much because my recital is the weekend after and I don't feel at all prepared for that to happen. yargh. We shall see.   I was supposed to call Megan tonight but I couldn't find her number :( Argh life. So now I am online trying to get ahead (or at least caught up) in all my email sending and scholarship ap stuff. Fun fun fun. I think I should attempt to catch up on buddhism reading too. And I should get up early too, so I can run some errands and still practice. yikes. What am I still doing online? :)

      Lauren feels special. This is my answer to worry. Feel special about something spectacular.   I am coming to realize (in both music history and everyday life) that people like to give titles to things in order to categorize them, to make them simpler and to be able to deal with things in black and white. But this isn't how the world works! Just about everything occurs in shades of gray. Lines are crossed one way and not another, or in both directions, or not at all. What's true for one person isn't necessarily true for another, but in order to talk about things with each other, we have to create some conventional standards. For understanding.  You can't put limits on life.

      I had the craziest dream last night. Disneyland had turned M.C. Escher and everything was wild. The park was on four spinning disks--but get this, the disks were finite to the top and bottom but ran infinitely in either direction side to side. So, there was a long path that cut the circle in half, and this never ended. more Paths went in other directions. I was there with Jessie and Natalie (of course) and we were on the "D" disk, which was sponsored by Donald or something. Anyway, from there it just turned into a scene from a Piers Anthony novel. We walked along the long path and it went over rivers and valleys and at one point, a beach volleyball game. And then we realized we had to get back so we followed this path that led back to the castle. There were more weird bits to the dream, but I thought the idea of an "infinite Disneyland" was pretty cool.  In the beginning of the dream (before it morphed into disneyland weirdness) I was a semi-blind girl who had been abandoned by her mother in a mall, and I was eventually adopted into some school for orphaned children. Anyway, I was apparently the heroine (or one of them) of a book, called "Three Cinderellas," because I went through this formulaic search for meaning, beginning with the discovery that I could actually see clearly if I tried, apparently I had a disease that made my eyes stay half closed all the time but I could fight it and I did. And then I went to the library to research who my mom was so I could find her and tell her I loved her or something. There was a weird scene involving a bandaid and a locker room shower, but I don't think I can clarify that enough to put it down. So, lesson learned here? Too much wine last night--;)

      HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY  My week has gotten better as of 4:30 this afternoon. We have officially found a place to live next fall. it is ours, we are guaranteed it. it is a bit far (413 E Johnson) but it is close to James Madison Park and Pinkus McBride and on the bus line. Four bedrooms, bathtub (!!!), hardwood floors, two balconies..it's all good now. The landlord rocks. he's super cool. My stress level has just decreased by 100 points.   Also I got flowers today! They are very pretty and they smell excellent (they are right by my puter so i am smelling their sweet fragrance as i type) and they were a surprise! Jerry and I are moving our V-day celebratories to Saturday because we are both booked tonight. So, at the risk of sounding mushy or sickeningly happy, i shall stop there.   any other news? just waiting for saturday because i don't have to work and that means lying in bed and not having to worry about things. aahhhh weekends, bless thy magnificent school-lessness.

      water polo tonight! kick ass. I took some hits to the face but represented, getting better at this whole fuzzy-vision contact sport thing.   had a crazy dream with megan in it the other night, but i can't remember enough of it to put it down. tomorrow going to look at a place which will hopefully suit our needs for next fall...i'm sick of looking! so here's hoping.  no other news (is good news). must sleep!

      I feel like there hasn't been anything terribly interesting to write about lately. just me, my schoolwork, jerry, my trombones, sleeping. no big entertaining gettogethers (although the lounge experience on tuesday was excellent and quite on par with the terry/jamey/ian days...ian! i miss him being around the SOM) or parties or anything. jerry made me dinner last saturday, and we each drank a bottle of wine, which was quite amusing...he passed out not long after (because he's a lightweight, ha ha! :). It was rather an excellent evening. went to the hockey game the day before with mikey, emily and chris, and that was a good good time as well.   megan, on the subject of people missing you, i do too! and i miss tara. i like reading your blogs because it brings me nearer to you, but it makes me sad too, because it's not close enough. i hope you guys can come and visit me soon (dci finals, tara?) because i had fun in davis and now it's your turn! hehe. anyway, you guys are doing exciting things and me, it's just my same-old life, practice practice practice. working at the nat is still tons of fun...although i don't have any shifts with anna amy or ryan, and arwen's in england, so that's a little sad. but i do get to work with becker (who rocks: becker quote of the week--"girls are trouble") and kate and matt and becky, so it's all good. the nat is a refreshing place to be for me, not only because the people rock but because it gives me another dimension outside of music. and i need that. i love the community the music school has given me but it feels like my connections in it are getting smaller, that we're not socializing as much--i guess that goes back to the whole "no parties" thing. there just aren't very many. and I can see why. 323 1/2 is long past, ian and bj are student teaching, and no one else seems to want to make the effort...although jason mentioned he was thinking about it. and we are definitely a party place...good times here all around, but we're ass-poor collectively and don't have enough to supply alcohol. it would have to be a strongly assured BYOB. Hmm...scares me a bit. Maybe I should start stocking up. yargh.   well, good enough ramble for now. i'm going to go dig up some food and sit around and wait for something neat to happen. cheers!

      **reminder to self** never again agree to spend the last weekend of spring break with extended family in milwaukee.  Am in Brown Deer visiting aunt  uncle and cousins...yes that's right i have a new cousin. His name is JJ (Jonathan Jarvis) and he's the coolest kid ever! Adopted, just turned a year old, he loves everyone and he's super happy. Exactly the opposite of Rebecca. That child gets worse every time I see her. And my time with JJ is limited because of her "Trouble Adjusting" to having a younger brother all of the sudden. Sigh. I definitely could have used today in Madison--practicing, working on my paper, spending time with my other JJ (hehe), keeping caught up on stuff--as it is i am going to struggle to keep up and still play a stellar recital this week. Well, that's life, I'll get it all done, and pretty soon the semester will be over! Oh I can't wait...And no more relatives!!

      slipping into a funk again--my mind feels ill. i don't feel particularily alive or happy, and i'm afraid of the future...of what? i don't know. i've done a lot of crying and i'm not even sure if i should be. i feel like a big emotional burden to jerry and myself, i spend so much time taking him for granted and then all of the sudden i have a serious 24 hours of crisis that something's going to happen, that i'm going to lose him. so i get all worked up. and then everything else comes crashing down on me. am i really cut out to be a musician? am i good to my friends and family? am i a good person all around? what the hell is wrong with me? i need a good night's sleep and a hug but i'm afraid the hug will only make me want to cry even more. i don't really want to go to milwaukee to see my family but i promised...it takes time off all the stuff i have to do next week that i could get ahead with. must suck it up and be worthwhile! i ask again, what the hell is wrong with me? why can't i be cheerful and happy, where did my calm buddha nature go? stop, thoughts, stop tormenting me!!!

      I am infinitely excited to be getting out of town for a few days! Jerry and I are headed to the Windy City tomorrow so he can go see a show in the Modern Institute of Art. We're staying at the Murphy's place, which means a great big house all to ourselves...I can't wait to go because I am tired of being here and tired of school and winter weather (not that the weather will be any better there, but at least it's winter weather in a different setting). And after break, the days will fly by and then it will be summer again! Hurray for glorious summer, my favorite season. All I want to have to focus on is playing trombone and going to work. And then I can fill the rest of my time with bike rides and frisbee and friends, parties, games, trips to the park, falling asleep outside....and on and on :)  I have summer fever something awful right now. I hate winter coats and hats (although I do like my scarf hehe) and I like shorts and sandals and tshirts. Can you tell I'm a CA girl through and through? All I need is the sun warming my bones, and everything will be absolutely groovy. Oh Summer, I pay thee Homage...please speed thy glorious self hither, and soon!   oh yes, i need a vacation :)

I wish I could make more of a production out of it (ie famous quotes, best blogs, etc), but I am just too busy and too tired.

      i don't particularily want to deal with brass quintet tonight. i know there is going to be anger, and misunderstanding, and things might not go very well. i am hoping that everyone (namely chris and davis) will keep their tempers and we can put the past week behind us, move on, and be a strong performing ensemble. this is my hope--not necessarily what will happen, i suppose. i know that there is a lot i can do to keep things smooth, and i know that this is my duty since in many ways i only aggravated a situation that was starting to heal over.  the situation as it stands is: rehearsal (and coaching) was cancelled last wednesday night because miah had an emergency and needed Chris to travel with him. now, granted we hadn't had coaching on monday because of the trumpet masterclass, but this is acceptable, someone was in need and chris stepped up to help. The problem was he didn't notify us. He told Mike, and Stevens, but not Davis Sean or I. The three of us and John show up for coaching, and no Mike or Chris. John told us to rehearse anyway, so we did, got some work done, and called it a night.  Despite this I felt like we needed to schedule another rehearsal, pronto, some talk was tossed around about friday early evening, never went through, so we waited til saturday night to schedule a rehearsal for sunday night. circumstances in this instance were kind of rare--i had an inservice til 9 and mikey had to work til 10. so we couldn't pull it off. I went to the inservice, came home, and got the message via Davis around 10 that Chris wanted to rehearse at 7:30 the next morning. Now, I have said before that I am prepared to dedicate a lot of time to this quintet, but 7:30 makes me cringe. This is the part where I'm not sure whether I should feel selfish or justified: 7:30 am is early, but being there at 7:30 means you have to get up at least by 6:45 to be ready/well-adjusted for the rest of the day. If you want to warm-up before, well, add another hour earlier to that. Getting the message at 10 meant I wouldn't get enough sleep and thereby the rest of my day would be a trial---and on Mondays I have a lot of day to get through. I also am thinking about my recital, and how it takes precedence over lots of things. If I'm crabby on Monday, I won't practice well Monday night, the rest of my week will be off in terms of sleep, and there is the potential of getting sick. I'm not being a hypochondriac, or overly anxious, I'm just conscious that I have to take care of my body for the next month to insure that I am in best possible health for my recital. I know that one 7:30 am rehearsal will not harm this. but here's the other side of the coin: don't make me get up at 6:30 on a monday morning just because you don't think you can get your head out of your ass for a coaching. If you are unsure about your notes, practice them. if you can't count your part, put a metronome with it. welcome the real world--one rehearsal, one concert. bam. that's all you get. now i understand that i have often ranted about being prepared for meetings with john, and it's not like i am a stellar first class musician who can read her music down without error. but at some point we have to take responsibility for our own playing and make it work. calling an early am rehearsal, in my opinion, will not solve anything.    so, am i right or am i just being pig-headed? in a way this was an exercise to get my thoughts organized before BQ. in another way i suppose i should have just agreed to the early rehearsal and we'd be done with it. i'd be tired, but i'd survive. to a certain degree i owe the quintet an apology. we can't be so stubborn in life that we never see eye to eye. chris owes davis an apology, davis owes chris an apology. i am hoping that this is quick and easy and we can put it behind us and start playing music and being good friends again, because those are the two most important things.

      Another week that sped by! But this one is alright, because I finally have a pianist for my recital, and things are good. so no worries. i have to work a lot--but that is good because i have to pay off my debts (bass trombone) and be able to fund my recital (lots of money to show off these days)...it's all good good good.  our toilet is backed up which is a big shit (literally and figuratively) because i have to use it very badly, so i am sitting here waiting for jerry to call back so i can go to his place and use his bathroom. sad, isn't it? ah well. well, it would be a good night to go out and party or do some sociable things, but i think i will be equally content with just watching a movie. hm. well, we'll see. :)

      WOOOOOOO  Okay, my renaissance paper is due on thursday and after that everything will be groovy, right? heh heh heh. hardly likely...well, it will be for a while at least. Until the next paper and set of tests rolls around. Jerry is off touring Wisconsin this week with the Jazz band. It is lovely outside, the humanities building is about 95 degrees (including the concert halls, hurray for wind ensemble!), and i am wearing shorts and a tank top. and new flip-flops! lovely. It is supposed to be even warmer tomorrow. tonight i am required to go sit through the trombone departmental, okay, so it won't be so bad but i don't want to leave the house again as it will be even more difficult to get started on the last half of my paper. i suppose i'm not really doing anything now except blogging...but hey, i did do a little researching over supper. Ah. Well I am going to pick up study food at Walgreens (they are selling 2 packages of red vines for three dollars) and maybe that will help (nothing like a stomach ache for good writing skills).  Ah well, I am happy it is spring!!

      Outside, it is lovely. My walk takes on a lighter step, i lift my head up and my eyes feel bright, the sky is blue, it's sunny, everyone's happy, there's nothing like it. it's spring. I feel like giving everyone hugs. A tingling feeling goes down my back when I realize that soon it's going to be summer and I'll be happy and everything pressing will be not so much or done completely and it'll all be wonderful. And then i come into the humanities building and check my email and realize that I HAVE SHITLOADS TO DO!!!! ahhhhh!!! Okay, calm, deep breaths. remember that once you make it through April everything will be wonderful. Your recital is done (and went well), all you have to do is take a test, write two papers, and then take two more tests, play in numerous recitals, and then...you're done! Ah were it so simple....

      My grandma Hazel's funeral was today. I met tons of relatives I've never seen before, and caught up with those I haven't seen in ages. Let me say that  I am entirely delighted with my mom's side of the family. They are all great people. Happy and crazy and funny all at once. My mom's cousins Nancy and Carl are my favorites--they live in Chippewa Falls and are good chums with Sarah and her family. I saw my cousin Todd!!!! I haven't seen him since I was six. He's thirtyish now, and he and his wife are expecting their first child. It was great to see him. In my memory he was always a hep cat...and he remains so after seeing him again. Cousin Tom (my mom's cousin, relation to me? I guess great-cousin or something) joked a lot about talking my parents into getting me a car. Twas good times. My dad's parents, my grandparents Ed and Sarah, are getting old too. Sarah is senile, and talks to herself and makes nonsense noises to me as if I were twelve. It was very sobering to spend time with them...grandpa turned 82 yesterday. They are the opposite in health: Ed has all his faculties but his body is disentegrating, and Sarah has lost her mind but is the perfection of health. It was a bit trying to see them. It  caused me to write a lot of poetry, which I will post sometime when I get back to Madison.   This is my first funeral. I think I have been very lucky so far, but now it starts. My grandparents are old. It was strange, to sit and see my grandma Hazel laid out and thinking, as I held my mom's hand, that someday I have to go through this with her and my dad. And I have no brothers or sisters to help me out. It will be very lonely I think, even with other people there. I never knew my grandpa Gilbert, he died when my mom was a teenager. But I was glad to feel like part of a clan, today, like generations of love and hope and experience extend back from me into the past, that I am not just one girl in the world but that I have people to back me up. I have never felt that before. Even when we lived in the midwest my parents and I seldom saw more than immediate family. I never realized how much I missed it until today. I hope that from now on I will never be apart or be separated from them for too long. I hope it won't be another twelve years until I see Todd again. I hope that Nancy will have that Gatzke (yes, we are very polish on that side) family reunion in July. And my kids will always know their family, no matter how far apart. I hope that the next time we meet will not be another funeral but a celebration of togetherness and life. I miss my grandma, but she is better this way...so many health problems and unhappiness and memory loss she had for the last seven years, and I struggle to remember her as she was when I was younger and she had health and mind on her side. But nevertheless I know she raised three good kids and if she hadn't, I wouldn't be here in the same form as I am now. I thank her for that, and I hope that she is happy and that she gets some pretty wings to fly down and visit us on sometime soon. Or, should the Buddhist perception of things be true, I hope her soul is reborn someplace close to me, and that I will know her again.   Schmu!

      Well, a brief week spent at home...it was to be longer but my grandma passed away and my parents and i are flying to wisconsin tomorrow for the funeral, and then I will just go back to Madison a week early. I saw Natalie and Dan, Katie, and Adam, I got a fierce sunburn (oh cursed wisconsin sun, thou hast weakened me), I went to the beach, I saw three movies (and fell in love with Peter Parker/Tobey Maguire),I read tons of books, including three rereads that I remember shaped a lot of my fancy childhood notions about who I was and who I wanted to be: The Emily books by L.M. Montgomery. I cried about missing Jerry a couple times, I cried about having to leave early, before Katie's party and before Jessie comes back, and I cried for lots of silly things too. It seems like I do that a lot lately, like my emotions have been laid bare...but then again it's always been awfully hard for me not to cry and I shouldn't  suppose that this is any particular time in my life. Jerry is playing the song that he is playing at the wedding we are going to in June. It's really lame. If I ever get married there will be no such thing. Maybe I will arrange Bernstein's Pas de deux theme from Fancy Free for brass quintet. I've always thought that was the most thrilling piece of music ever written. It evokes in me the feeling I get when a romance is just starting..there is a lot of thrill and sexual tension, and so much expectation.  I will miss San Diego this time. There's a way the sky looks that I have never seen in Wisconsin or anywhere. And the air just feels...like home. I guess that it. Integral parts of me belong here and I can never deny them. There is too much ocean in my soul. Colors are more vibrant, little things delight me more. I can feel at home in my body like I never can anywhere else. It's comfortable. I suppose it comes of growing up someplace, and learning so many things...tis the atmosphere that loves us and shapes us, that makes us and helps us be.

      Everything is done. I've finished all my finals, turned in my paper, and packed my suitcase. One more school year has completed. It's weird. Not being one to get all sentimental about the endless passage of time, I'm just floating around in wonderment. Summer is here, and I've been desperately waiting for it. It doesn't promise all the fun that last summer was, but it will be good, relaxing. It's funny---I go into summer with such a Buddhist perspective on things (well, having just taken a class on it helps i suppose) and it all seems so calm and clear. Lots of changes have taken place, and not all of them seem good or constructive, but in some way, everything will be alright. As I was walking to turn in my paper today, a man was on library mall preaching about coming to Christ and worshipping the Lord. And I thought, "Out of great compassion for the sake of all sentient beings I undertake the path to Fully Enlightened Buddhahood." It was almost subconscious the way it popped into my head. I felt sorry for the man, whose level of understanding of ultimate reality is focused in samsara. More and more of me is bracing the ideals of Buddhism and, while I don't take so much to the actual practices, the rituals and the meditations, it seems that I can make my own religion based upon the good traits of all human thought.  Maybe someday when I am totally disillusioned with relationships and my failing musical career I will give it all up and become a bhikkuni. What the hell, right? But first I'll figure out if I can be happy in my own self.

      softball game today! we lost again, but put in a good showing. Got in my mandatory exercise for the year---well, that's not entirely true but it feels so good to run around and feel healthy. I think I will try to do some of that every day this summer, besides swimming and bike riding. Lots of frisbee playing is in order. It looks like it might finally be spring (knock on wood)!!! And I am looking forward to coming home too and spending some quality beach time. I am saving my brain for finals and papers and such so maybe I will come up with some gems of wisdom after i get all that done. :) I LOVE SPRING!!

      Ah yes! a typical humid hot wisconsin summer day. I love summer. no really, I do! Lots of relaxation. and I can finally cross off my list that email to Stoner that I've been putting off for a month. For the weekend I went to Jerry's hometown near La Crosse, Galesville. I had a super good time. We went to the wedding of one of his old high school teachers, hung out, played with cats, and just basically had a good time. Today I am free of work because the pool has some problem...anyway there is no water in it so no one can swim!! hehe. Tomorrow I only have to do one shift, the evening one. So this is a nice break. I'm hoping to contrive some other ways of making my working days shorter for the rest of the summer. ;)   Practicing is going pretty well. I am hopefully taking my horns down to Elkhorn sometime soon for repairs, and then Bernard will stop being annoying with the loose screw and Bianca will finally have her chem bath.   I almost feel like going to the SERF to swim...since I work every shift I never have more than 20 minutes in the water...but I imagine it will be incredibly crowded because the Nat is closed. Ah well.  I recently read a book that has put a lot of my obscure thoughts into words, and expanded on them quite a good deal. I recommend it:  Even Cowgirls Get the Blues  by Tom Robbins. It makes me what to go live in the wilderness somewhere, deny civilization and lead a happy and enlightened life in the environs of nature.   just so, it is time for dinner :)

      Adam's link updated at left. Adam is keeping me busy updating his links. What's next?!?!  I just made the world's worst Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich. The PB and the J were alright, but the bread made it very difficult. First of all it wasn't pre-sliced so I had to cut it myself and one sliced ended up being way too thick and the other too thin, and the first slice was sort of stale, and the crust was really thick so every time I bit into it I lost a bit of jelly somewhere. Plus the bread was sourdough, which doesn't work too well with PB and J. Yargh. Annoying? you bet.   The most exciting thing today is that the pool is closed, temporarily, due to extreme temperatures on the deck. Something or someone happened to the heating system and unfortunately when we opened at 6:30 this morning it was about 110 degrees. So we closed the pool, and until this is fixed I don't have to go to work. Yeeehaw! Bee-u-tiful.

      Well, it certainly wasn't any sort of premonition, just an educated guess, but when I said that my attendance at funerals had only just begun with my grandma's, I didn't expect the next to be so soon! My grandpa passed away yesterday. So Friday I will be at my second funeral of the month. I don't know...like with my gramma, I didnt' really feel anything until the actual service, and I think it will be the same this time too. I don't really feel anything but worn out right now. Worn out of thinking about mortality and other such things. Once I get outside and feel alive again, young and healthy, I think the feeling will pass. But it's so hard to know what to say and do and how to be.

      *does the summer dance*  started work today...hurray for seeing 6 am! aw, twasn't that bad, although i came home and crashed in bed again and had some crazy dreams. I didn't think I could make it without going back to sleep, although that was my goal. It was pouring this morning and by the time I got to the Nat I was soaked and unhappy, but I have since recovered. I'm thinking about snoozing again for a little bit and then getting started practicing. Then it's back to the nat for my final shift (hey, this day hasn't been too long...although those fifteen minutes sitting with Betsy who was tired and didn't say anything were probably longer-seeming than the rest of the day) and then dinner and more practicing and then perhaps a run with Jerry-monster? It depends on if it refrains from raining again. Well, I am wasting valuble nap-time. Adios!

      Hello all. Sorry for leaving you hanging on the birthday stuff. Well, it was FUN and it's great to be 21. Lots of freedom which is awesome. Lots of people buying me drinks. Sweet!  For the past couple of weeks I've been thinking about putting Buddha Stew to rest. I am having a hard time posting everything that goes through my head and am starting to realize that I don't have to put it out on a line for all to see, I think I"ve matured past that point. I've been writing in my paper journal a lot more. I'm also turning into a bit of a "technophobe" which is a silly term really, I shudder to apply it to myself...but I guess what I mean is that I don't need this...all this complicated technology to make my life easier. It all seems so decadent. All of life in America seems too decadent these days. So much crap that people don't need, but buy anyway, so many attitudes that buy into consumerism and diversity and politics, and I just can't take it anymore. It makes me somewhat nauseous. I mean...well, there's this guy in NY trying to sue the major fast food companies because he's obese and has health problems. How ridiculous can we get? And we all so hyped up on destroying our "enemies" and freeing the world of  terrorists, because, automatically, because we are such a great nation and so accomplished and wealthly and blah blah blah, we, and our way of life, are always right, always supreme. If this fat guys case stands up in court, that's it, I will move out of this stupid country to some secluded village in Switzerland, and live happily ever after. But Americans...oh we just make me sort of sick. Got to go someplace where they've got things...well, maybe not figured out, exactly, but at least in better perspective.   Well, that's a rant, for you. What it all sums up to is this: I love Buddha Stew but it is becoming more apparent that I don't need it anymore, that maybe no one really reads it anyway, and that it's just a modern  convience that I shouldn't complicate things with. I think maybe someday I will write a book, and I will call it...Buddha Stew. What a metaphor. What a great fricking metaphor. :)

      FIVE MORE DAYS!!!  til the big 21. Hurray! I am thrilled about my party, and painting, and maxwell street days, and i think it will be a great weekend. It sounds like I should have a good number of people show up, and maybe some surprises, who knows!?!? Golden birthday, here I come!  Got a postcard from Megan the other day. Prince William on the front! Figures! Hehe. I laughed aloud when I saw it. Wish I were in Europe. Wish I had time to go home too, before the summer ends...but, well, it doesn't look so good for that happening. Too much busy-ness. I am excited to move, even though it will be a hassle to get all of our crap out of the house. For some reason I am totally psyched up about this bookshelf I'm going to get. I dunno. I just have so many damn books. They need a home of their own. :)   What else is new? not much! I wish summer weren't going by so fast...but that is its nature, and I suppose there's nothing I can do to stop it. Yarrgh. I will try to post more. Although I'm not sure anyone is really reading. Ah well.

      Whoops! Haven't posted in a while. Well, Here's the news:   Got back from a fun family weekend up in Chippewa Falls...waterskiied, swam, ate brats drank beer had fun. Glad to be back. Familyed out.   Took my horns to the Edwards factory today! Christan is the man. Dude. My bass is all fixed up and my tenor got a total recalibration. I am awaiting my valve section which needed some work.   Well, it's hot and gross and I've felt like just one big headache. I am sad that I will be roomateless again as of friday, and this time for the long haul. I want to go to Europe! Should have thought about that. Ah well. Spending enough money on horns and stuff. But it's almost birthday time, my favorite favorite day of the year, and I am looking forward to it...I shall be throwing a party, and hopefully lots of people will show up and get drunk and have a good time. Yay.   Well, I think a spell of lying on my bed and not thinking about anything might be a good idea. Toodles.

      I have been reading some of my old blogs, and have come to the conclusion that my life was much more interesting and I was a much sillier person then. Now I am all settled into this relationship with Jerry and I don't bitch and moan about boys or ramble on about self-esteem. Plus I am all feminist now. haha. Yes, I'm a stodgy patriarchy-hating bitch. yay me. Anyway, my college days are over (for now). I graduated yesterday. Good Buddha! That's a weird thought. I don't have to go to school anymore, if I don't want to. I will, but I don't have to! I can make a meager living off my Bachelor of Music degree or simply quit all that and become an exotic dancer! Hurray! Life is good. Tomorrow I am flying home to SD, Jerry is coming too, and after about a week we are driving (in my car, MY car!) to Michigan where we will be counselors at Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp. Hurray again! That should be fun. I wish I had thought it out a bit more, because recently (what with the onset of warm weather and green foilage) I have realized that summer in Madison is really one of my favorite things. Ever. Of course if I stayed there would be no Jerry but there would be Bethany and Em and Dan and lots more people. Hm. BUt I am committed now and anyway, it will be quite fun. I look forward to it. Unfortunately I will have no email or internet access. So no Buddha Stew again. Ah sigh. IT will be okay.  Anyway, a early morning tomorrow. perhaps i will post from San Diego. Cheers

      I have added, at left, the link to the coolest band ever that I am in (ha gotcha there), which is Googaloo. We have a gig! My first gig (well not really, but okay, whatever). It's a halloween party (which isn't on halloween).  I don't think we're getting paid, but I think we get free drinks and stuff. Whatever.   Anyway I would like to apologize for the very depressing posting I did last night. Everything will be okay at some point and I just get used to having lots of time in which I can do other things, like practice (groan). Because that's not always the case when social activity is present. Most of the time my horn loses out. So I will shush my whiney mouth and get on with it. Speaking of, I  should  actually practice...  you know what's a funny word? peanutweasel. hahaha

      I am so so so lonely. I'm trying hard to reach out to people I know here, but it's difficult, everyone's got a life and there's no room for me to barge in, lay out all my loneliness, and expect friendship. I miss everyone in Madison and I'm longing for the day when miraculously Jerry and I can have a phone conversation that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and without awkward pauses. Life is going on without me and I'm stuck here, no progress, no love, no nothing. I thought maybe by this week I would have a job and be teaching, but neither happened, and I don't want to bother Sean again, I know he's busy, and he can't be responsible for setting up my musical life.  I keep telling myself that this is just a transition, next year it will be go go go and I'll have people and work and life will take me with it. But it's so hard, because I've spent so long being a social person and needing people to share moments with...Jerry tells me he wants me to be happy. All I want is a friend to share some conversation with in person, someone who'll take me out of the house and wake me up and shake the cobwebs off of me. And it's not like I'm not going out myself, and looking for people. I just feel really...lost. I can practice and exercise all I want, but that doesn't add up to companionship. And I have this cell phone, I prostituted myself to the cell phone industry, but why? No one ever calls it. It's not like I need it to keep track of my busy social life. My parents have a phone line, and that'd be free for me to use. What's my deal? It's become the symbol of my loneliness. Cell phone, sitting silently.  It looks at me like I'm crazy. It just wants to be used. Talked to. It wants to be busy. Kind of like me, too.

      i'm sad.  philadelphia  is a sad movie. *sob*  well i have hippocrappy oaf rehearsal tomorrow and i'm going to stand up for my right to not be bored or annoyed and tell them to find a different 'bonist.   also!!! my parents are going to palm springs, randomly, until tuesday. HURRAY I HAVE THE HOUSE TO MYSELF!!! now if I only had someone to share it with, like friends. Sigh.   kind of weird, but jerry was all sickly yesterday and now i'm feeling a very bad vibe coming the region of my throat. and i'm getting all achy. no good. what i'm wondering is where would such an illness be contracted from, as i am not in contact with anyone except my parents. grr. maybe jerry is telepathically sending me sickness since he knows we can't physically infect each other any more.   i am going to go sob for a while about  philadelphia,  then i am sleeping.

      Jerry has started a new and different blog, which is now what the link at left will take you to. happy reading.  Man, I am  having the strangest dreams...really cool dreams, but where the fuck are they coming from? Last night I dreamt I was a twin, and my brother could fly and I could run really fast. Only we were in trouble for something big, and trying to escape. But my brother got knocked out and I had to put him and all our belongings in a shopping cart and run to a hotel. And there was lots of lightning everywhere. In my dream I was having trouble thinking of a hotel in RB. I still am. Is there even a hotel in RB? Hm. Might be useful to know if I ever get in trouble and have to stuff everything into a shopping cart and go.

      Isn't it kind of funny the way deodorants all die the same death? As you pop off the lid, the oval-shaped remainder of your depleted anti-perspirant flies majestically through the air and lands at your feet, cracked and broken, as though that flight were its one last attempt at greatness. It can no longer be stuffed back into the container, as has been done once or twice before, but only scraped up from the floor and tossed away. Oh deoderant, what wonders did you carry with you, nevermore to be revealed? Shall I ever grace my armpits more with your sweet scent?

      greetings well last night I got call from Lenny (in Googaloo, the band that I LIKE) apologizing profusely for not telling me that they had for this week changed the rehearsal to Wednesday night.  Could I come? Oh sure, what was I doing besides watching the Recall Candidates debate? (This whole thing is very stupid. I am NOT voting for Arnold) So anyway, I packed up my stuff and headed over. It was a good rehearsal. I played a few really bad solos, because as you may know, I have had no practice or training whatsoever in improv. Gr. It will get better, I just need to think a little bit while I'm soloing and not just start playing notes. The just playing notes part will come. Anyway, this group is fun, I really am glad I'm in it. After we took a break we jammed again, like last week. This time I really just focused on the notes and played a couple of licks that were almost not square. Hehe. Oh, and I correctly identified the chords without having to be told. I really think somewhere hidden in my dense musical head is a perfect pitch rockstar. Or at least really kicking relative pitch.  I chatted with Natalie online yesterday, and realized that she's coming home in December already! I thought she would be in France all year. Well, that's cool, because I know Natalie will hang out with me. :) I called Dan but I know if I want to do anything with him I will have to keep calling until I actually talk to him.  After I got home from rehearsal I watched Mullholland Drive. Ok, I missed the first half hour. Is that bad?  because I am totally confused. I mean...what the fuck?!?!?  It freaked the shit out of me.  Anyway, I'm mostly just passing time because I'm staking out my AIM. For some reason, although I clicked the button that says "start AIM when internet starts" to NOT do that, it still does. Or so I think. It hasn't come on yet, leading me to believe that perhaps it is something my parents are doing accidentally.  Well, I give up. I slept in way late today, I should go swimming but maybe I will do that tonight. I should do yoga too but I've lost some motivation to do all the things I've been religiously doing the past too weeks. I knew it, the motivated stage has given way to my characteristic lazy bum stage. Push through, girl!! rrrrowrrrr!

      At right, please notice that I have added Jessie's beautiful journal to my links. Please click and enjoy her adventures in Glasgow.  The funny thing is, now I have all of Jerry's sibling's names on my link list, even if they aren't really his sisters. So Jennii Jessie and Jerry. Hah! That crazy family with the J names.  I'm super starving because I went off to a yoga class this morning and didn't eat. My parents want me to go up to Dana Point for lunch with them. Well. That's very nice. But I think they are gluttons for punishment. I mean, we'll just get cranky with each other and I'll be mad because dad will do something or say something and if I comment on well then I'm the bad guy and mom will sulk, or try hard to be cheerful and it will all go to hell. I'd rather stay. I'm not prepared to make conversation this morning, partly because I have not much to say and I don't want to talk about my friends back at UW because that will make me sad. Grr.  So of course it will hurt their feelings if I say I don't want to go, but it will be torture if I do. I was planning on getting a haircut and practicing.  I'm being so good about playing my horns! (knock on wood) I'm up to about two hours a day. Of course last night was extremely frustrating. I think I may be pushing my chops a bit hard, but it's good for them. Get in shape dammit! I need to get into a good grad school.   I applied for work at Borders. I have a good feeling about this one, but of course that doesn't mean much. I just think maybe finally someone will hire me. I'm pissed about the lifeguarding gig because I am MORE than qualified for it. Grr. Look, I just want a job, ok? So I can spend the money on things like music and cds and plane tickets to wisconsin. Or Scotland :) Grrr

      okay, so i guess i was deep and introspective on my last blog.  can't promise that everytime! well I've decided to give it a go here in SD for a while, even though I get terribly unhappy when i think of Madison and talking to Jerry on the phone or IM is like pulling teeth (come to think of, most of my trying to talk to jerry is like pulling teeth)....I guess I can be a bum for a year. Anyway, Sean called me and is going to help me get set teaching private lessons, and he's going to help me with grad school auditions. So I'll be busy doing that (now that I've picked up my dusty trombone again, I'll have a lot of work to do!). Also I posted my info on a website, and so far two bands have asked me to be their trombone player!!! So as long as I'm busy and playing, I think I'll be okay. In the meantime I am occupying myself with cleaning out my room and closet.  I've decided to live at home for a while since I don't think I can afford living expenses on top of car and food and credit card expenses. Oh well. I rearranged my furniture and tossed a whole ton of stuff (including my desk, which will be sold at a garage sale along with most of the contents of my childhood toy collection). Today I am tackling the closet.  Once I have cleaned the closet, I can tackle the immense load of stuff that I brought back from school that is still sitting, packed, in the family room taking up space. So my parents should appreciate that.  As interesting as that is... Well it's time to practice.

      Well well well (deep subject) Inspired by Davis, I have revived good old Buddha Stew. I guess it never really went under; like a good and faithful companion it has remained, quietly, uncomplaining until the day I would again take up the reigns and write silly random stuff again.  And why I am I back?  Well, for one I am extremely bored, and lonely. I have returned to San Diego after spending a summer at Blue Lake, before which I graduated from the prestigious University of Wisconsin-Madison with a degree in Music Performance (trombone). Several reasons prompted me to leave my dear Madison behind, most of which are rather shady and I'm beginning to think it was a bad idea in the first place. I mean, right now I'm living at home, jobless, friendless,  gigless,  counting the hours until I get a place, job, friend, gig. Meantime I am thinking casually about graduate school (in which case I should practice) and considering the possibility of putting all my stuff back in the Contour, saying "fuck it" to this damn expensive and overpopulated city, and heading back east to *gasp-dare I say it?* the place that I now consider home.  Yes Wisconsin. Now how, you ask, could any self-respecting California girl reject the land of Dreams and Beautiful Blue Ocean Vistas for the land of Cheese and Farms? My answer:  FUCK YOU. You've obviously never spent a good amount of time there. I am sick of the question. Go stick your head in a goat's butt.  Perhaps you are wondering from wither come all this unmitigated hostility?  My answer: You are a tool. I could use to hammer up my shelving units.  Alright, enough of that. My brain has been wandering around and around in my skull searching desperately for something else to think about, but that's hard. What's life about anyway? Where's my direction, my purpose? Do I have any? Should I be talking or should I shut up and throw back a cold one (berghoff, please) and join the rest of America in not questioning, not caring, not giving a shit about anything? Why not watch the damn reality shows and the damn dating shows and the damn reality dating shows?  The answer is:    what a headfuck this is, eh? Of course I could wander on an on but where would I get. I want to go home. I want Jerry and the cats and Scanner Dan and Expresso and Himal Chuli and the lounge and drunken football games and... hell I guess I want to be a college student again.  Well I said I would be. Next year. So what's stopping me from sitting on my stupid tush for a year until I get to go off and start over? Why not waste time?  Answer, please.

       tomorrow is another day...   But it's the day I'll be in Madison! HURRAY. Excellent. I can hardly wait.   Well, we've been trapped inside for three days as most everything is closed and besides it's too smoky and ashy to go outside: air quality is super low. Today is better-I can see the sky and the smoke clouds are father away. However, yesterday was terrible. The little village of Cuyamaca was entirely wiped out by the fire and today Julian (home of excellent apple pies) is being threatened. They're not expecting this fire to be entirely contained until mid-November. Lord.   In my sitting at home time (I must admit, it's not much different from what I usually do; the only difference is both my parents are home and tensions high-another story entirely) I have been exploring the world wide webberverse (thanks, Jake Morgendorffer, for that classic) of feminism. I've been frequenting the (s)hitlist at Bitch Magazine and reading a blog from another Lauren who has some very insightful things to say about just about everything. www.feministe.us  I've also ploughed through  Slut  by Leora Tanenbaum, which we had to read sections of for WS102. It's an excellent book, and man, it makes me wish I could change the way high schools operate in terms of sexuality and gender roles. I was lucky enough to escape a lot of harassment in HS, but I know I was affected by the attitudes of "good" girl and "bad" girl and desperately fought to suppress all notions of sex and any feelings I had sexually. At the same time, though I desperately wanted boys to notice me and measured my self worth in those terms. I think I came out on the good end of things: I did well in school and valued my girlfriends first and foremost (there were those moments where we were all jealous and vindictive at some point, though) and had my own opinions and so on. But so much time was wasted worrying about boys, when I could have been doing so many other worthwhile things. I dunno. I'm not as bad as some. I carried it with me into college and ironically only started to see past that when I actually had a boyfriend. But that's why being with Jerry is so awesome-we built a relationship built on each other's strengths. Plus I took Women's Studies and man, what an eye-opener. So I've started back in on  The Gender Knot , Allan Johnson (which should be required reading for EVERYONE), which is quite a task. But it certainly raises awareness of patriarchy and how it is so complex and hard to break down--basically because people won't acknowledge it. They think feminism is at its end because, look how much progress there's been. Women have sexual freedom (ha! One look at the Kobe Bryant rape case will tell you that there's still sexism hard at work), have important positions in companies, etc. But how much of that is just tokenism, and how much have people's opinions really changed? Look at commercials. Gender roles are still rigidly enforced. "Momma's got the magic of Clorox bleach." Any beer commercial. Men drink beer, women want them. And what about sitcoms? Lots of stay-at-home moms there. Now, of course you can stay at home and be a feminist. Feminism gives you the right to choose your lifestyle. But I think advertising and media plays an important role in showing people how they should behave. A woman on the Bitch shitlist made a good point: In the last twenty years our culture has gone from being a patriarchy society to a consumer society that is built on the tenets of patriarchy. So, basically, things may have changed but advertisers and media execs market patriarchal views (such as "momma's got the magic") because they're relying on statistics that show them women stay at home, women, even if they do work, do all the cleaning and laundry and cooking. And why would men want to? They're being told that this is, has and always will be women's work. With commercials out there showing only women doing these things, would the average Joe (homophobic, manly, however else stereotypically you want to think of him) go out and buy, and then subsequently use, Clorox bleach? Maybe more enlightened husbands and fathers do. But there's still a prevailing attitude out there that says who does what and how.  Then I read this TERRIBLE article, linked from another site, about how women "can't have it all" and are choosing more and more to be stay-at-home moms. No mention in the article is given to how fathers play a role in this phenomenon. To me it suggests this: Women are staying home with children because more and more they are being made to feel guilty about not doing so. About being "bad" moms. I don't think there's as much societal pressure out there to be a "good" father. Plus, it's very hard to find a company that will offer paternity leave but every company is required to have maternity leave. What's up with that? So we're still stuck in the conception that men hunt and bring home meat, and women gather grasses and raise children? I think that's exactly what it is. And let's get into this cult of the "real man," shall we? That backlash to feminism that says, "oh no, now you're discriminating against men, boo hoo, look at us poor men, now women won't drool all over us and make us dinner, whimper whimper." The same cult that says let's stop all this now, you've had enough change, look at all the women execs, etc etc etc. The same cult that says any show of emotion, any weakness is feminine, and therefore homosexual (I've never really followed that logic, it always seemed to me the weakest link in the homophobia justification).  I could go on and on. I'm sure I've pissed off someone (you liberal feminist bitch you! you deserve to be raped! i bet you're ugly and fat too!) but that's the way it goes and those people don't know how to argue anyhow. I don't hate men. There, I've said it. I think men are great. I think the men I know are great, and I respect and admire them to the end of the world. What I don't think is great is setting up gender rules and expectations. I don't think it's great to being having a good conversation with a guy and then realize that he's just nodding and looking at my chest (translation: there's a time and a place for flirtation). I don't think it's great to be thought weak or stupid, to be expected to clean up after a man, to look sexy but only for the gaze of men, and to only want it when they do. All of these things have no place in the social order: they are concepts that you define for yourself and within the boundaries of relationships and daily life. Society has no business telling me what I should be. Only I have that business. That's what feminism is for me.  the "women can't have it all" article http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/219-10282003-186329.html

       who needs a scapegoat?   I think it's despicable that there always has to be someone to blame. It always has to be someone's fault, people are unable to accept things as they are. They want someone whom they can lash out at, sue, slander,  hate . Just so they don't have to get on with their lives and face facts.   There's still a lot of danger from the fire but the wind has died down and some people have been allowed back in affected areas. So now we've got the finger-pointers, the people who want justice served. So some guy was lost in the wilds and lit a signal fire, supposedly. So he's been arrested. Now, sure it's a dumb thing to light a fire when surrounded by dry, scrubby brush. But here's the thing:  dry scrubby brush  wants  to be set fire to. It's that time, and nature wants to clear things out a bit. So there's been no rain, and along comes a Santa Ana with enough dry strong winds to fan any, I repeat  any  sparks there might be. It doesn't take much. These are all natural environmental fires. Also, there are fires raging all over southern California. You can't tell me and expect me to believe that a hunter in Eastern SD lit a fire that burned down Ventura county. Bullshit. I know that they suspect arson in some of the fires up in LA. But this isn't arson, this is just a dumb fuck who got scared and did something stupid. I hope that people are calm and sane enough to understand that he cannot be held responsible for all of the damage that's been done. This is a combination of factors that would have happened even if human hands weren't involved. A bit of broken glass in a bush, the sun reflects off of it, and boom, that bush is on fire. It's easy enough to create scenarios where someone doesn't actually LIGHT the fire to see that this was going to happen.   Also, people are blaming Governor Davis. Now that's just plain ridiculous. I am sick of this state that so obviously thinks that all of its problems are caused by one man. I saw on the news one guy say "Aren't you glad you voted for Arnold?" You sir, I know you will never read this, but you sir, make me sick. You make me want to vomit all over your stupid head. So he and some other nitwits think that Davis withheld some government airplanes that could have helped. So Davis gets on and says that basically he's doing what he can but those planes are under federal jurisdiction and he can't just send them off where he wants. And then the fire chief gets on and says, with or without those planes there's not much we could have done. It's so out of control, with the wind, that some things are out of human hands. I don't understand why people can't just accept this. We live on an unpredictable planet, but we've gotten complacent. We want to know that we'll never die, we'll never be inconvenienced, and if we are, well then it's somebody's fault that they didn't stop it. I think that's a lazy way of thinking and I think it's cowardly. Suck it up. Fire is unpredictable, it's dangerous, and in this environment, it's uncontrollable.   I think it's terrible that people have lost homes and memories, cars, even lives. This is definitely a catastrophe. But (except for lives) these things can be replaced or rebuilt, if you have the courage to understand that you have yourself, you have your family, and that's what counts. Please don't place blame, unless it's perfectly obvious that someone fucked up and it caused your personal loss. Do not, for the love of Buddha, go blaming the firefighters like that dipshit in Crest, who lost like six properties (ok, that does suck, but what are you doing with six properties?). He's got it in his head that his homes could have been saved but the firefighters weren't competent, or something. Let's look at the bigger pictures, shall we? There are fires EVERYWHERE. Not just at your house. They are stretched thin as they'll go, and part of the reason they were unprepared is that some of our resources were sent north to help with fires in LA and Orange County.   This is no one person's fault. This is the result of a combination of factors that couldn't be prevented and we have to accept that, and understand that nature is bigger than us and it will kill you. So deal with it, or get the fuck out of the way. Take a little time to be thankful for what you have, not what's been taken from you.

       san diego is burning...   no, seriously, it is. well, the eastern portion. scripps ranch and mira mesa. crazy mad fires everywhere. ramona. the sky is orange. the freeways are closed. ash is falling everywhere. it's windy as fuck.  after the gig last night (which went pretty well i think, except for being shoved into a tiny loft with a railing exactly at the right place for slide discomfort), I drove over to Adam's in El Cajon, as he was having a party. Got pretty wasted. Ugh. I really don't want to ever be that tore up again. I talked to Chris Galaviz, which was weird. He tried to get me to go home with him, which was annoying. Anyway, it's strange (and kind of crappy for him) to be graduated from college a whole year before my freshman section leader. He's three years older. Oh well. It was nice to talk trombone for a while but I'm definitely done with random high school people for a while.   anyway, so i spent the night at Adam's and woke up the next morning to this. fire, everywhere. Getting home was a nightmare. I15 closed down at Balboa Ave, so I took that to 163, which closed two miles later at the 52. That whole corridor, from Miramar to RB, is just shut down. So I had to go to the 805 and hook up with the 5 (wow, we have a lot of damn freeways), at which point I cheated (otherwise I would have had to take 5 to 76 to 15, which is the freeway equivalent of making a U-turn in SD) and took Del Dios back to Escondido and then down. (Del Dios, for my non-SD readers, is a little strip of a road that winds around from the west, Del Mar, to the east, Escondido. In my area of the city, if you want to get to the coast you either have to go way south and then west, or north and then west. you can't just go west, because of the endangered natcatcher. long story. Del Dios is kind of a short cut, and it's very pretty. takes you past such historical sites as the Del Mar racetrack and the Heaven's Gate house) Anyway, it's all crazy and my mom's worried, she said she could see - SEE - flames from the grocery store. That's scary. If it gets any worse we might be told to evacuate, although I don't think we're in any real danger. The problem in the areas with the fire is the scrub, the dry brush and the big eucalyptus tress. Scripps Ranch is pretty much drowning in trees. Jessie's family lives there, so I'm concerned about them.   Brush fires are always a problem out here, and this one's pretty big. It's hard to contain because there are many small fires and the wind is out of control, so new ones keep starting. Lots of houses have already burned and more will go, for sure.   well, i'm going to go drink 823987 more glasses of water. and try not to barf.

       data, sometimes a cake...is just a cake.   Yeah, so I just watched the final episode of Star Trek TNG. Well not all of it (plus I think I have it lying around on tape somewhere) but anyway that was WEIRD AS FUCK. But cool. That was a good show and I don't care if I'm a nerd for saying it (Davis will support me on this one). I remember watching that when it aired with Megan, and us getting a kick out of the line, "with mint frosting." Also how Warf looked so uncomfortable holding that cat. Har har.   I am DYING to leave this house. All I want, I've realized, is to be LEFT ALONE by my parents. That means no questions, no TV on at all hours, no doing chores unless I feel like it.   Okay. So I'm being unfair. But I have adjusted to living without them and I have come to realize that I enjoy living someplace where I know I will not be bothered. It gives me a chance to recoup after a long day, wake up in an early morning, and do whatever I please as far as cooking, cleaning, sitting on my ass, masturbating, whatever. Right now I reeeeally, REALLY want my own place. For my own sanity. And for their mental health. Please. Buddha. Argh.  The thing is, I'm not totally anti-social. But I think the cats can attest to this: I need my solitude sometimes. It helps me be social at other times. It's not like I'm always holed up, and it's not usually for any particular reason. Sometimes I just gotta be alone. And here, at home, it's in your face all the time, "What's new? what did you do today? how's Jerry? Talk to anyone from school?" And on and on. And I know they're not being nosy, or trying to annoy me, it's my fault for being crabby and not wanting to talk to anyone.   Ironically, of course, I don't want to be lonely or alone all the time, which is what is happening now. So you think I would crave those few moments of human interaction with my dear and loving parents. But for some reason it just makes it worse. I'm grateful for the free place to stay and the free food and everything, but at the same time I itch at being so indebted to them. As if I didn't already owe them for 22-odd years of school, toys, books, music, university, trombones, etc. I'd like to be self-sufficient, because I know I be, so right now my pride is taking some blows. I think I'm going to have a hard time making it a whole year. I'm thinking about shortening it, maybe going back to Madison next summer if it ends up I'm going to school back in the midwest.  I know I can get a job working the city beaches (sounds like i'd be the lake hooker, or something, doesn' it?) and if Jerry goes to BL I can sublet. And if he doesn't well then for sure someone else I know will be subletting, but whatever. These are just idle fantasies and I'm dying to get out of the house even temporarily, so I'm going to do what I usually do in such cases, and go to Borders to get myself some o' dat fine chai they got over dere.

       what dreams may come   ONE MORE WEEK! one more week and I will have friends again. Weeee. :)  Anyway, yesterday I finally took that water test for the Poway lifeguarding job. I rocked it! Oh yeah. Actually it was pretty easy. I think I should be good to go for the job, and I'm totally happy about it. I had forgotten how nice it is to work at a pool, outside, making money and gettin' a tan. Yeeeep. No, seriously, I do like lifeguarding and I am excited to start again.   Speaking of makin' money. I coached again for that middle school I worked at last week, this time for just one girl, so it was more like a private lesson. But anyway, I think that's a lot easier because you can focus more on specific problems. So I get paid for that and for the one I did last week. Excellent! And Monday I am coaching for a high school. So pretty soon the dough will be coming in and I'll be able to pay for some of those bills I'm racking up. Arrgh.   On a slightly odd, personal note, I'm beginning to notice that whenever I have a dream about sex, whether I am participating or not, it always seems to have a very disturbing air about it. For example, it could be totally normal, commonplace sex in a regular old bed, but it's always got this atmosphere of depravity, like there's something wrong. You know how dreams always have an atmosphere to them, whether you know that something bad's going to happen, or that you're totally happy or whatnot. Anyway, my sex dream atmosphere is always negative. Hmm. What conclusions can we draw here? Am I oppressing some aspect of my sexual nature, in still holding on to some ideas that sex is carnal and evil? or maybe I'm predicting that someday something bad will happen to me during sex? Or maybe I'm constantly afraid that I'll be discovered, or punished?   Well who knows. Anyway I much prefer the real thing. So, again I repeat, 7 days! one mere week.

       it's really true   Yes, it's true. You really can have 400 TV channels and have there be nothing worthwhile on.  Take it firsthand folks; it happened to me.   I'm feeling too lazy to practice, and anyway my parents have retired for the evening. Actually I'm feeling rather sleepy myself. I don't want to start in on a new book, because I just demolished a huge one ( The Shelters of Stone , Jean Auel. Fifth installment in that prehistoric romantic tale of Ayla and how she basically invents everything useful as we know it today) and I'm feeling like I need a break. However, there's not much else to do. I could study for the GRE, that might be useful. Or play a computer game.   Honestly, I'm not really sure just what I should do with myself. Couldn't get myself to the pool in time to swim, don't really have any money with which to go out and buy myself things. Or entertain others. Have already completely cleaned and sorted closets. I could race marbles. Or color. Watch a movie. Stand on my head and recite Shakespeare. Fart the alphabet. Oh the possibilities.

       and now, it's time for a breakdown...   Well, let's see. I don't have too much to say, except that I did have a fairly good weekend. Last night I hung out with Adam, and got drunk. Yay! How exciting. Well I am a certified lightweight as of now, and I need a few more nights with Adam to get me back on the drinking track. Seriously though, it was a fun time. Watched  A Mighty Wind , which was pretty funny. Sampled some of what San Diego has to offer in microbrews, and missed Wisconsin. It wasn't bad though. Just not Berghoff. :)  Today I learned how to convert a midi file into notation on Cakewalk. Adam from Googaloo has promised to give me a copy of the program so I can start doing it myself, and contribute some new songs to the band. I'm thinking about arranging David Bowie's Fame, although I can't seem to find any midi files that sound even close to the original. Even for a midi file. Anyway, I am proud of my newfound knowledge and I think I will make good use of it!  Well that's me. I am looking forward to my trip to Madison--less than two weeks now!Consequently, Davis' blog today sums up a lot. I empathize, and I wish I could offer some advice. I could use some myself! *sigh* To quote Coldplay: "nobody said it was easy, no one ever said it would be this hard."

       what price, nostalgia?   Staring at a menu for an Italian restaurant placed in my hands by my mother, and being informed that we were ordering in this evening, I was tossed back into a wave of memories and a conclusion that leaves me rather weak and beaten.   The simplicity of this Italian restaurant's menu was a contrast to the vast selection of pasta and sauce combinations found upon the menu of a certain Tutto Pasta, and therefore I was instantly reminded of it. That dark restaurant with so many complicated levels and rooms and a lot of tables shoved into awkward spaces and servers with their club shirts on and the smell of bread and olive oil. I can say I've been there more than five times. But the occasions- that crazy Valentines day stunt we came up with to ensure we were not dateless; Bethany's 21st and the silent acquiensence of the waitress to assume we were all 21 (well for the most part we were); Jerry's 21st--I lived through each of these evenings and many others in a flash and realized suddenly that that dear Madison is lost to me, that I can never live those times again except in shoddy replications that I force upon myself. That in four years I won't know anyone left there, and it will become just another city, another place in the fold, just as San Diego is for me now. I remember missing the memories here too so desperately as a freshman, and now what? It's another place and there's no one here to share it with. As much as I don't want Madison to be that way, I am slowly accepting the fact that what I love so much about it is not itself, but the memories that are attached to places and people.   Of course I dearly love Madison on its own--a quirky little city with its hypocrisies and contradictions--a place where I always know where to go to eat and where to find friends. A place with young kids, a place with old hippies, smoky bars, good music, unpredictable and annoying weather, lakes, beer... The fact is I will never be a college student again. Sure, I'll be a graduate student, but only for a little while, and then what? Do I move again? Do I start completely over and trek across country for job offers that dissipate upon arrival? Do I spend another two months lonely and sad, friendless? Do I worship the memory of the city I have left?  This insecurity has left me exhausted, and of course it stems from the lack of gainful employment or even otherwise useful activity. It almost makes me vow to settle, to find a place to call permanent home. Because I don't want to go through this torture again, this insincerity of living that beats at me day in and day out. I want to start making new memories, and have those memories remain safely hidden in the day to day business of making even more.   Of course life doesn't always work that way, and I am fully understanding of this. Things will always change, and I as a musician will always be forced to change, to move to the job, to be willing to follow it wherever it may appear.  So it appears to be a shoddy choice of employment for me, no? Me the stable cancer, a slow moving crab that rejects change and loves to stay at home and surround myself with the good things. Yep. On this thing I can say that the zodiac rings a bit true. Silly eh? Well there have been sillier things. And I realize now that in order to discover your mistakes, sometimes you have to make them first.

       in which i am not wearing underpants   ahhhhhh  I have just returned from another satisfying rendezvous with the sex-in-shower-head-form. Oh WaterPik showerhead, you are indeed a marvelous creation. Thanks ever so for the relaxation of my cranky neck muscles and pesky shoulder knots. I do praise thee, thou art glorious.  Today I am feeling like my trombone playing is a little out of control. I think this embouchure thing is going to take a long time to get better. Mostly I just feel like I'm getting a hollow sound and my lips aren't comfortable at all. Also my high range sounds like complete crap and very forced. GRR. Well, perservance is the name of the game right now. Just so.   Tomorrow I have my first coaching session, and I'm a little nervous. Well the thing is I not really sure what to do. I don't have any fun music and I don't know if we're working on band stuff, or if I'm supposed to bring stuff in, or what. Hm. I've decided to copy some simple warmup stuff and little tunes from Arban and if we're not working on band music then we'll do that. It's only forty minutes, and I think I should be able to find things to work on with young trombonists. Eep.

       ooom= pah?   Nat McIntosh is playing sousaphone in my head, I swear. I can't get any of his licks to stop roaming around in my mind. It prevented me from sleep for at least two hours.   No seriously folks, that was awesome. It would have been even awesomer if they'd actually been headlining, as opposed to covering for some stupid jam band from SF. Joe said they are trying out a new booking agent and that he's been doing some stupid things. Grrr. So they only played for about an hour, but boy were they on fire (as always). Mostly they played new stuff and it all sounds awesome. I have the new cd,  center:level:roar , which I would definitely listen to right now if I could guarantee that I wouldn't' be wide awake for the next 72 hours.   Actually I might go see them again today, as they are playing around 2ish at Oktoberfest (chhheye, Ia'm Kaahrl Straauhss) and Joe said he would call me if he could get me a free ticket. But it's only five dollars so I think I can manage---especially since he put me "on the list" last night!! Hehe. I've never been "on the list." I thought that was especially awesome. I think he felt bad that we came out for a big show and they were restricted. Anyway, I made a fan out of Dan (he bought both  Unlearn  and the new one), and even Josh Chappie and Shaun Haber looked amused (i think the kicker was when Nat started doing his thing. You know, the  thing  with the crazy whack tuba playing...).   Man, it was a good show though. I mean, it would have been better in Madison, for sure---but what was awesome about last night was that we were so close and it was kind of like getting a private show. My left ear hurts-well my earplugs should be arriving soon in the mail to prevent this from happening again-but it's the price you play for getting to see how tightly that band runs, how they know everything perfect and how extremely talented they all are. This is new music folks! Go check it out if you haven't already.   (now, I have to start plotting my evil plan in which I knock off the other trombonist and get Joe to get Nat to ask me to join the band. eeeexcellllent.)

       things i have learned from  close encounters of the third kind:    1. aliens can play the tuba 2. aliens only abduct men who look like Richard Dreyfuss....come to think of it, the movie only hired men who looked like Richard Dreyfuss, all bushy haired and wide-eyed with side burns. Or maybe that's just the decade.  3. if we really did come into contact with a race that required us to communicate through music, i'd never be out of a job (maybe they want to play some orchestral excerpts with me?). 4. cute kid 5. aliens are suffering from malnutrition (look at those pot bellies!). 6. aviator sunglasses really were fashionable at one point oh yeah, and that one other thing: 7. music really is the universal language! that's right bitches, give it some respect. damn fools.

       it's youngblood day, baby!   Oh boy it's gonna be a good night. Dance dance dance my pants off.   this made me happy, beyond all belief:  last night I went night swimming (sing REM here) and it was nice and quiet and I had the pool to myself. Since I had actually brought clothes with me (usually i just go in my suit and a towel, or suit and shorts for biking) I decided to rinse off really quick in the shower. Well my club has done a great thing. They have installed WaterPik showerheads. With four different massaging spraying options. Let me tell you. That was heaven. I've never had a real massage that good. Just me and the hot water pounding on the spots that hurt. Ooooh baby. Gotta get me one of those. hot damn.

       you fool of a took!   Well I feel better today. I have gotten some things off my chest and maybe that'll help. Last night, as you noticed, I could not sleep so I sat up and watched the extended DVD Fellowship. Whew. Quite a movie. That was four and a half hours of movie fun. It is a good movie--I liked it better the second time (and also the extended version) because I could see more details. I also thought of it as a sort of "companion" to the book rather than a faithful retelling. You know, sort of as a guide to get your imagination going, or a glimpse into how everyone sees things differently.   Well I'm off to the pool so dorky lawyer guy can try to flirt with me again.

       fall cleaning   I took away some of my outdated links--if it was one of your pages and you plan to start up again soon let me know. I only deleted the ones that haven't been updated in more than a year. Yipes!  Well big news for today is that I have decided to abstain from AIM usage for a few days. I feel like I'm becoming dependent on it because I so desperately want to talk to people. Well if you want to talk to me you'll have to call me. End of story. Mostly I am feeling like one of those annoying people that jumps on you the minute you come online and wants to chat chat chat. And it just doesn't substitute. Also I get very frustrated with Jerry, who doesn't talk much anyway, because most of our conversations look like this:   Llama721: what up? Skrtch4brkf: nothing Llama721: nothing here either Skrtch4brkf: cool Llama721: yep Skrtch4brkf: wooooooooo  and so on. There you go, a little taste of how the online distance non-relationship fucked up thingy works.   I'm just kind of angry and tired and crabby because I had a rough night last night---I was really feeling the distance and felt very hopeless. Lots of it turned into anger and trying to think about how I could blame Jerry for what I was feeling, but I can't and I definitely shouldn't.  It's just frustrating because I feel we have nothing to say to each other, and that's more frustrating because I go on all sorts of tangents trying to understand what that means for us. It's so hard to go a day without thinking about how much I miss him. And I get angry again when he says "Be happy" because I can't, because he makes me happy, he completes the puzzle. Now this is not a concession to modern feminine ideology. I know I should make myself happy, but I learned a long time ago that what I need to do to make myself happy is surround myself with good friends and quality people. And although sometimes the faces have changed throughout the years, there are those that I would despair of if they drew away their friendship. For example--Megan. She's the dearest person in the world to me and I can always talk to her, no matter how long it's been.   In the time that I've been with Jerry, he's become my best friend, the one person that knows me, how silly and stupid I can be, without any of the controls I put on for use in other social situations. To not have that here, close to me, is making me shut up inside myself and present a different face to the world. It makes me feel like I'm dying inside. Rotting away.    The truth of it is, I have to live with what I consider the biggest mistake I've ever made. There are small consolations to having moved here- I rely on my trombone for company thus practicing a lot- but in the long run I should have thought about it. I should have known that there would be consequences. I am not, at the current moment, strong enough to deal with them.

       hans und frans vill pump yooo up!   that's it, get me out of this state now. *Sigh* Well it's over and yes the Terminator is governor. Who knows. I'm done talking about it.   A not-so-exciting day. I woke up late as usual and practiced (which i should go do more of), read, fell alseep again (shit, now I'm super groggy), etc. I had a quite morning as both my parents were at work for once. I'm really dying to have a place of my own. I think I've come to the point where I would really enjoy that. In college I always despaired of not having roomates as I thought I would be lonely. Now that I am lonely, I think having my own place would allow me a little freedom. To go out, to have people over, to have a kitty. To have silence when I wanted it, and not have the tv on at all hours (better yet, not to have a tv AT ALL is an option). To once more, have a kitten. Or two. For happiness. Is a kitty. To practice until midnight if I so needed. Of course this would mean more bills, less money and not as much travelling. Well I will become patient and wait it out...next year I should have my own place. Maybe even by next summer. It's very exciting. I can't wait to return to school. Join the crowd again.   Saturn's Day rehearsal was quite entertaining last evening. Three nice guys, good musicians. I am discovering my improvisation side quite nicely, and even becoming a contributing member of making music (I can listen to something now, and quite clearly hear possible licks/hits that would fit in a certain section). I am quite thrilled by this--it means that I can become a more complete musician and maybe even composer someday. At least it bodes well for my teaching lessons.  I got Dan, the drummer, to say he was going to the Youngblood show. T-minus 3 days!!!!!!  Well my horn needs me. Adieu.

       say anything   I have to say that the most beautiful movie I have ever seen is  The Red Violin . Such artistry. True filmmaking, in my opinion. Such a seamless story with such great interplay and buildup...it is beyond words, such a gorgeous gorgeous film.   Anyway, I'm off to a rehearsal tonight for a band called Saturn's Day. They are kind of funkish like Googaloo, only as of now I think I'm the only horn player and they are expecting me to come up with some licks and all. I'm listening to their cd now; it sounds very good so it should be a nice experience. However I'm not sure how creative I am feeling--but maybe it'll be better once I get my horn in hand.   I have been playing quite a lot since I fixed my embouchure problem, and it's really nice. I think I will definitely give a recital sometime before the year is out, or early next year Januaryish. So people are home and can come. I'm not really picking out too much rep--instead I've pulled up some old pieces to work up. These I also plan on using for grad school auditions. Sean and I were supposed to meet tomorrow night, unfortunately he had to cancel as he's subbing for the Redlands symphony. Ah well. Not my only disappointment of the day:   The lifeguarding gig called---they are postponing water tests and interviews at this time. Until hopefully sometime in the next few weeks. Ahem. Gr. Arrrgh. Is this not,  is this not , the stupidest thing you have EVER heard? I mean, first off, they didn't process the aps for three weeks. Then when they called for an interview, it was scheduled a week later. Now, it's all on the fly again. So what I'm wondering is, who do they think is applying for this job? It must be mostly high schoolers, people they think they can keep waiting or something. It's ridiculous. I guess if I hang on long enough and get a job maybe no one will be left as competition. Still, it was promising and I liked the idea of having limit work commitment so that I could practice more. ARRGH. Well whatever. They obviously have their heads up their asses.   Oh yes, and I voted today. No against the recall, and for the green party guy, Peter Camejo, in case the recall goes through. Of course he won't win but I really didn't want to vote for Arnold or McClintock or Bustamante because they all appear to be assholes. The upside of it is, of course, that I got an "I voted" sticker. So everything's alright in the end.

       yeah, well i'll recall  you ...   okay, tomorrow finally all of this crap will be over. well i'm sure it won't be over per say...because you'll get all the people with their bitching and moaning about what happened and who's governor (hm, gary coleman, or mary carey?) and blah blah blah. Politics is the most ridiculous thing EVER. I am so sick of this. personally i don't want a body builder as governor--maybe we should learn from missouri's mistakes. i know it's a little unglamorous state but california has got its head up its ass.   my parents, glorious examples of the conservative republican breed, as frustrating the heck out of me. i don't dare express any political opinion for fear i lose either financial support and/or break their dear little hearts. well, it is my opinion that politicians and all other people who like to close their minds and hum along while other people express views and ideas can go fuck themselves. hard. i am too angry and too frustrated to be eloquent. ha-rumph.  i had a good long talk with dan last night; we went out to dinner and dove right into the deep discussions on life, liberty and all the "isms." twas good, and nice to have a friend. :)  well, all my letters are out to the local middle schools and all i have to do now is wait and see. excitement.

       who's lazy ass?  my  lazy ass!   That's right, it's 1:17 pm and I am still in my pajamas! In fact, I only just officially got out of bed! (well I got out of bed from like 10-11 but I was so confused about what to do with myself that I went back to bed in hopes of starting over)  I'm trying to work out my day schedule. You see, I am now forced into leaving the house in my car because I told a little white lie to my neighbor lady. Janet is old and infirm and requires much of her neighbors: drive her to this hair appointment, pick up this box, unhook this bra (that last one is a little disconcerting, but actually not altogther gross or intimidating). Anyway she wanted me to go to a movie with her, but I said I had rehearsal. I'm not really opposed to free movies you see. Some part of me resents that she's seen through me: here is another human being who is lonely and desires social interaction. Mostly I just don't want to drive her around, help her with every little thing, and make conversation about her weak arm getting stronger since she broke it. Make sense? I actually don't mind doing these things too much but today I am particularily full of self-pity and lazy-assness.   I would like to do some of the following:  Have the same kind of great day practicing that I did yesterday Swim Buy blank cds so I can raid the library and start burning that shit up (here is a new wealth of free classical and jazz cds) clean my bathroom organize and complete my bulk mailing to middle schools about private lessons take the online practice GRE  You may notice that only two of these require me to leave the house. So I'm in quite a pickle here (you see I wouldn't mind about the leaving, it's just that sometimes I get the spooky feeling she sits in her living room window and waits for signs of life from her neighbors so she can call them and demand they pick up a bottle of wine for her), but I think this is what will be done:   I will warmup, maybe even do a little extended practicing, then clean my bathroom, then clean myself up a little (not too much) and leave to buy blank cds. I will take my suit and towel with me and go swimming after I have done so, and then come home and do the other stuff. This way I will have been gone about an hour and a half, which should be acceptable.   Okay. remember folks, always tell the truth, and you won't have to make exceptions for yourself.

       well it was saturday night, i guess that makes it alright   what makes me quote prince you ask? well maybe i'll try out putting titles on my blogs, for fun.  anyway, last night i had a long talk with dan which was nice, and then today i talked to josh chappie. i had heard that josh was in town and i thought hey, why not, who needs a social life? (lauren) Anyway I am working on finding as big a posse as I can to descend upon the Youngblood show next weekend. I am so excited, I can't wait. What an incredibly awesome band.   went to the mall, bought some tshirts and my mom was kind enough to buy me a new watch. my old dear watch disappeared somewhere between my car and the terminal at the Milwaukee Airport. Well that made me very sad, so I got the exact same watch. hehe.   practicing is going rather well today, and I'm happy. I went to the OTJ (online trombone journal) and posted about my frustrations with embouchure and all, and someone wrote back with the advice to tighten my corners, they might be loose from playing bass and not readjusting when I played tenor. So I tried that out, and low and behold...well I'm very grateful. I have to start working up all the grad school stuff, and also have something to play for Campbell in a month. Frustrated as I am with my bass playing, I've decided to put it aside until after grad school auditions, or at least until I feel I can play my tenor again comfortably and not screw things up. I'm sad about this; I love Bernard dearly. But I definitely need to focus on this one big thing and really work hard, and he's going to make that difficult.   i am hungry. i desire to eat.

      Well I have had a productive morning!!  Let's see: I have organized, somewhat, my graduate school stuff. At least I kind of know what I need to prepare and all. So my list is as follows: Indiana University UW (of course, the more I miss it the more it becomes appealing) Univ of Michigan DePaul (oooo chicago) ASU (kickass music building) USC--this I am skeptical on but Sean really recommends Terry Craven as a teacher so what the heck.   I'm wondering if I should expand my options a little and look outside of the US. But what I'm hoping is that maybe these options will open up to me as I experience a little more of the professional world, and, hopefully, get taken more seriously as a trombonist. So I think for now I will stay here. I'm kind of excited about what will be known henceforth as the "Midwest Tour" in which I will schedule my auditions for UW, IU, UM and DePaul in the same time period and thus get to visit the Madison kids, Katie, Grant, and maybe Val respectively. Or anyone else in Chicago. The exciting part is that I have a place to stay at all of these schools so it will be fun. yes. fun. :) If only I could rent a car!!! gr.   Also, I polished up my letter to the local middle schools about teaching and sent it off to Sean to have him proof it. I stopped by RBHS last night and got from him a list of all (ALL) the schools in CALIFORNIA (what the fuck), and now I must muck through this ENORMOUSLY LONG LIST and find the ones in SAN DIEGO. Well they have addresses and all. I was pissed off immensely when, after I had finished copying all FIFTY pages I realized that the stupid ^@*%^~@%^$ band office copy machine had continously been cutting off the left hand side of the page, thus depriving me of one third of ALL THE SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. So I ran through and just wrote down the ones in SD. The band office copy machine has been doing this to people since forever. Since I had to copy stuff for marching band and pep band and all the things in between. You'd think it'd be time...but well, arts education, haha, has no money. Anyway, once Sean sends that back to me I can send it out to ALL THE SCHOOLS IN SAN DIEGO and hopefully get some students. And maybe some coaching gigs.   I also am applying for a job at Bernardo Heights Middle School (my alma mater) as a music assistant. Woohoo! It looks like fun: I get to do some conducting and chamber stuff, and basically just assist. In the production of music. Of course it is a middle school band and occasionally I have memories of the terrors we inflicted in middle school upon our poor director. Hm. Well, it's a job anyway.  Last night was Googaloo rehearsal. Only we didn't really rehearse. We went to Adam's house and goofed off, basically. Adam wanted to clean up some charts and put some four-part harmony in, since we have added to the horn section Pierre, on tenor. He's french! He has a french accent! I think he might be scared of us. I told all my naughty jokes to Lenny, since we were pretty bored. We played with rubber chickens.  Adam burned me a Poncho Sanchez-Freddie Hubbard cd. And a Johnny Cash cd but I get that next week. It was quite fun and I feel refreshed and like I have friends, or at least goofing off partners, whom I will see at least once a week.   Well, I'm still stuffy headed and going swimming is unappealing. I think I will do yoga instead, and call that my exercise for today.

      countdowns of my own (inspired by davis): 6 days until the California Recall Election, which is stupid. 10 days til I get to see Youngblood!!!  30 days til I get to go to Madison and party hard. and hopefully get some lovin'.  okay so those are the only two things i have to be excited about, currently. Although let's see if I can make some more:   57 days until thanksgiving, which means I might get to see some friends.  83 days until Natalie comes home from France, which means I will have a friend all the time :)  340-odd days until I attend grad school, and have a life again. Maybe.

      exciting things for today:  the lifeguarding job FINALLY called for a water test and interview. lord almighty. of course it's not til next week which means if I get the job I probably won't start for like two more weeks after that because they are slow as fuck. i repeat: slow as fuck. (my apologies to my younger readers) Good grief it's been three weeks already since I turned that ap in. And I turned it in on the deadline! Grr. Anyway, I hope I get the job because I need money.   I emailed James Campbell (the new trombone prof at UW) to ask for a lesson when I'm out over Halloween. And he's available...so hurray! Now I can judge for myself if he's hot or not. hehe. Anyway, he was very straightforward in the email, telling me what to bring prepared (generally, like excerpts and solos, and a rochut), and I like that. Now...how does one go about getting offered full rides and assistantships with out asking, like Griffin and Grant do? Oh yeah, you have to be some sort of amaaaazing musician or something. Well guess that counts me out.  Ha-rumph.   I am having the hardest time getting out of bed lately. I wake up at a reasonable hour (like 8:30 or 9 or so) and prepare myself to get up and get going...but I just keep falling back asleep! It's not like an "i didn't get enough sleep" feeling. It's more like there's something seriously wrong with me and I'm lethargic and all. Maybe I'm anemic. Hm. Weird.  Anyway, I managed to get up before 10 today and go swimming. For the first time in a few days. So that was nice. I rode my bike there, and it's getting easier to go up those hills.   My Jack anttena ball is missing!! My poor poor Jack who lost all of his facial features except his nose but still valiantly travelled twice across country with me and was loyal to the end. I am sad today, for I have lost a friend. I also have no idea how to spell antena. Antenae? Anttenna. What a weird word. Sigh.  Well, I think I've cooled off enough that I can take a shower. And that sounds mighty appealing.

       today in local news, a social life loomed on the horizon...   ...but experts are expecting that it should pass shortly after the holidays. Stay tuned for updates on the phenomenon's progress through the city and how it will effect you.   Between seeing Bela on Tuesday, talking to Megan for four+ hours on Thursday, having the girls over Friday night, and bowling last night, yes, I am a girl in demand. Or rather, I am demanding that people demand me. Excellent.   Last night Chappie called and invited me to come to 11-1 two dollar bowling at the dear old high school haunt, the Poway Fun Bowl (oh Fun Bowl, how do I love thee). I skipped over after work, bowled about seven frames, and was rudely interrupted by our lane being turned off. Apparently it only goes until 12:30 now. Oh well, at some point in there Dave and Steve showed up, and we packed up and went to Dennys (oh Dennys, how do I love thee). The group, Dave, Steve, Shaun, and Josh, hasn't changed much. They are still silly and random. I enjoyed myself immensely, and it was good to talk to Dave again (is it possible for a mouth to get bigger with age?). Since we broke up (holy five and a half years ago) I've forgotten most of what he's actually like and how our relationship must have been.   Outside of parenthetical side comments on my budding social life, I really don't have too much to say about it. Between this and work, and going to TJ next weekend (hurrah!), I think I will have something resembling a busy schedule. Maintaining trombone playing is the biggest challenge and I definitely need it! Quitting JCP after the holidays should help out a little. I do want to do a recital but I am decidedly slacking in the preparations department. I think I have my pieces almost ready, but as to location, and pianist, um, yeah, and date...well I promise that if you were thinking about visiting for my recital I will keep you posted (This edition of "wink wink nudge nudge" is dedicated to Jason Hausback).  Tired. These have been late nights for poor little old me, especially when usually I've been sleeping until a leisurely 10:30 and leisurely putzing around until noon at which point I get down to the business of leisurely practicing and surfing the internet. Well, I hate to stop boring you with the details, but I must. Time to get ready for work.

       feminist ranting!! hurray!!   On another note, I meant to post about this a while back but life got in the way. You know how it goes.  urlLink This  is what is known as the Gender Genie. It performs a nice bit of scientific magic and determines by syntax and pronoun usage whether an author is male or female.   Guess what? According to the Genie, I am overwhelmingly male. I put in four blog entries, three came up male and the fourth female. To be fair, I didn't really carefully select the entries I put into the program; three were rants (Average Joe, Drugs, and The Beauty Myth) and one was an old school Buddha Stew posting about Ryan. Guess which one came up female?   The Genie measures gender based on an algorhythm and scans texts for pronouns that can determine whether the author is writing about relationships (female) or objects (male). For example, I, you, them, and us are, according to the results, the territory of a female author. Quantifiers or identifiers (one, many, a, the) signify a male author. Because my three rants did not use personal pronouns and contained objective language, they are considered male, but the fourth is an emotional testament to my womanhood as I am most definitely talking about people.   The theories that this program brings to mind (men and women are different! see! now, how can we justify that women are inferior because they talk more about silly people-to-people issues?* [and you all go, whoa there crazy feminist, chill out]) seem to me to be utterly insignificant. Stupid. Can't we spend our research money on something better, like cures for serious diseases? So you've proven that men and women are socialized to talk about different things. You haven't said anything people didn't already know. I resent being told that my writing has to have a gender; it's my writing and it shouldn't matter whether I have a penis or a vagina, or even simply a pair of XX chromosomes. It's another example of how our society is so stoically stuck in this black-and-white division of gender as male and female. Men can write emotionally and women can discuss political matters. It's about time we dropped this debate of "masculine vs feminine" and got on with the business of living.   *this issue has come up in "chicklit," the recent trend of woman authors being categorized together by similar subject matter when oftentimes the novels can be very different and on varying levels of depth. The example given  urlLink here  (go into archives, and click on "Marketing Ms Right") is the difference between  Bridget Jones' Diary  and  The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing . The trend is to market all new books about female singlehood and the antics associated with it as "the next BJD" or "if you like BJD..." even when the books are completely different. BJD and the Guide are definitely different books. Surely they share similarities, but it's harmful to lump all books by woman authors into one place. By doing so you diminish the better works and you assume that no one else would have an interest in reading them (like men, for example, oh dearie). Anyway, read the article, it says it much better than I can.

       a blog about nothing in particular   I have ploughed through my recently acquired issue of  urlLink Bitch , successfully made zucchini and tomato curry, practiced the third movement of the Stevens Sonata (and rocked it, subsequently), eaten cheesecake, and talked to Megan on the phone. Happy Thanksgiving.   I am wondering if I have a particular stance to explore on Thanksgiving.  urlLink Margaret Cho  is not so keen on the genocide and racism associated with a bunch of European pilgrims wiping out the indigenous population and claiming the land. I agree, and I especially feel sympathy with her statement that she is "thankful for every other day of my life." But I'm not totally going to give up on Thanksgiving. I think it should be redefined.  We could use this day to go out and help fix the things we have destroyed, to show that we are truly thankful for them. Help out at a reservation. Clean up a natural resource. Something. But I suppose it'd be hard to give up that day of the year we get to endorse gluttony and watch a bunch of men throw a ball back and forth and run into each other. Oh wait-we already do that every other day of the year? Well then, what's the problem?   [Disclaimer: I like food and I don't think gluttony is by itself a bad thing. However, our culture does not have a healthy attitude about food whatsoever. Consider McDonalds, compared with evergrowing anorexia stats. Message?  I have given up being surprised that society lacks a happy medium. Ai me.]  My curry was good, by the way. I have lots left over. Oh yes, and I have a proposition to make to my friends across the country: If you gift me with your presence this holiday season, I will delightfully return the favor by offering you free room and in town transportation. No other gift exchanges are necessary. Happy after dinner nap, everyone.

       does a great band need showy light effects? what do you think?   concert last night: amazing. What's that Victor Wooten? You think I'm a super trombone player and you want to tour the country showcasing our collective talents? Okay, sign me up. hehehe.  It's great to see musicianship like that on stage. Music that doesn't require words (although I did enjoy the songs that had lyrics) but relies solely on the power of the players, the virtuosity and ensemble tightness together. My question to you is: what do you think about flashy stage effects? Are they necessary for a band that so obviously can stand on its own? Or do they dumb down the audience, directing people's attention to a certain player or creating different "moods" that are already expressed in the music?   I appreciate the subtle effects at the beginning and ends of songs, and I did like the opening sequence with the lights when they weren't on stage. But during the songs, I thought the light effects were a little obsessive. Almost to the point of being annoying and distracting me from things I wanted to hear. For example, if the ensemble got soft, the lights would dim and add blues and pinks. If it was hot, fast, and intense, the lights got bright and danced around a lot. Lots of times if one player was soloing, the spotlights would cut off the other musicians. Or a hit in the music would be accompanied by hits in the lights, flashes.   I personally think this was stupid. Bela doesn't need that, his band works so tightly and perfectly to create moods and feature players that he is cheapened somewhat by the effects. For me, I want to see what ALL of the players on stage are doing at certain moment, and I don't want a lighting system to tell me when to look at someone. Sure, Jeff Coffin's playing a solo, but hey, isn't Futureman doing something different with that whatchamacallit, how does that thing work? Oh wait, I can't see it because they cut off the lights in that part of the stage.   I think you could also argue that the light effects are part of the artistry of the show. A gesamtkunstwerk, if you will. But I got the impression that it was more pandering to the audience's lazy side, the part that watches a lot of movies with intense visual effects and music tuning in at the right moment to let you know when the villain enters. Those kinds of movies, or any kind of movie, is gesamtkunstwerk too, no? A total work of art involving visual and aural effects in many combinations. But how far do we take such works? How far is too far, where you're simply handing emotions to the audience on a platter? I know that Wagner had something different in mind for gesamtkunstwerk; using a movie is the closest analogy of our present time I could think of.   So while the Flecktones stage effects were by no means crazy aerial stunts and fog machines, I can't help feeling cheated by the flashiness. A little insulted perhaps. Of course, I'm used to hearing music on its own, in concert halls and bars. Much of my perspective comes from a classical training and I have more concept of musical forms than the average Joe, I suppose. My dad and I had a conversation the other day about how, when he would go to see my band concerts, he always felt like the music was over his head, and that we should play more common tunes like marches and standards. While I shudder at this (what musician wants to play marches at every concert? Not me that's for sure) I can see that he is coming from a background with little to no musical experience or knowledge. Sometimes art music has to be understood to be appreciated fully. I agree with Davis that art music is lessened by its presence in commercials and movies, but I see it as part of the growing trend of caring only about music if it can be used to portray emotion when combined with a visual effect (or,as the case may be, sell beef). What is needed is more music education, more music appreciation, and less selling out. Hard enough to do as it is. Now throw in a little Britney Spears and stir. Sensationalism. Ye-haw.  An interesting side note though: think about a scene in a movie, say a horror film. The protagonist is entering a scary scene, it's dark, windy, the trees are all bent and twisty, etc. Cue a string bass. Low note, no vibrato. The music builds and builds, leading us to expect that at any minute a crazy chainsaw-wielding mass murderer will leap from a tree and commence bloodshed. Now imagine this same scene, without the music. You might still expect something freaky to happen, but without the characteristic low string note, you might not anticipate it quite so much. Now, take the music without the scene, and you still get the shivers, no? Because music has a power on its own that cinematic effects do not. Music will allow your imagination the full extent of possibility, while a visual scene is often limited to the meaning the director intended.   My conclusion: Music=awesome. Bela Fleck=awesome. Sensationalism=bad.

       ups and downs   In the shower this morning I got all sad because I remembered last Thanksgiving and hanging out with Jerry and his family, and it was tons of fun. Unlike this Thanksgiving, which will be a long day of cooking (but I'm making zucchini curry for myself!) followed by a meal in which I will inevitably piss off my father, and then we will clean up and spend the rest of the evening in separate rooms watching TV.   Then I realized that I didn't have to be anywhere today and starting practicing, and I was (sort of) happy again. Then Prof David Jackson, at UM, called me, and talked to me about studying with him. He was super nice and definitely made me more interested in the program (it was at the bottom of my list, to be sure). After I finished up practicing I wrote up my repertoire list, personal statement, and revised my performance resume, and packaged off my UM application! It's done baby, and only two left to do, but now that I've written the PS they'll be easy. Then I have to get started on financial aid forms.   Yesterday I had a moment. I realized that it was silly of my to be working the JC Penny job when I was offered a very lucrative gig  playing trombone  for twice as much money as I would make in a weekend picking up clothes. So I got offered a job  doing what I want to be doing professionally  and instead I got a minimun wage job folding sweaters? WTF, mate? All because I was little bit afraid, not of going to Mexico or whatnot, but of giving up my weekends. What the hell do I do on weekends anyway? Jack shit. Nothing, zip, nada. So I'm full of it, and I need the money. So I asked the guy if he still needed me, and he does. And he's willing to work out the weekends I need off to go to auditions. Unfortunately I forgot to tell him I wouldn't be starting this weekend but next, so I hope he's not pissed off at me that I replied with, oh well um shit, sorry, can't do it this weekend.   This means I have to talk to Penneys, which I'm not too worried about. The thing is, I'm holiday help and the only real disappointment they might have is that my mom works there and I don't want her to be embarrassed or anything. But still, if another of their employees was offered a job doing something related to their field of study, they wouldn't hold them, would they? I'm stepping up, right? I'm also justifying this with "since I'm not too sure what I want to do right now, I should try lots of different things." Maybe Penneys'll want me still to come in like once a week. Whatever, ain't gonna say no to more money. I do have to get Mexican auto insurance, and I'm not sure how much that's going to cost me, but my first Penney's check should hopefully cover it. Besides, the reasoning in my head goes like this:   I have reworked my understanding of this year off to be solely for the purpose of my trombonal improvement. This means I get to freeload off my parents whilst practicing as much as possible and making a little bit of money to tide me over. Working at Penneys does not allow me to practice as much as I need. While it does get me out of the house and away from the continuous TV noise (Matlock and Murder She Wrote reruns, oh my), it also keeps me on my feet for eight hours and away from my trombone for precious practicing time. Ok, so I'm totally riding on privilege. And I'd love to get a place of my own. But I'm going to be patient, and use this year to improve musically so that I get into a school AND get the money I need to finance it. With the TJ gig I have all week to hang out and practice (and can still coach), to get things done, etc, and I get to play a sweet gig with cool music. I think I was silly for passing it up. Plus I don't really care if I piss of JC Penney. If I have to hear that stupid Outkast song one more time while reorganizing the pink shirts that are too crowded on the four-way rack I will run down the hallway screaming and brandishing a hanger. What's cooler than cool? My foot jammed up your ass, Outkast.   AND THE EXCITEMENT OF THE DAY IS: Josh Chappie has just offered me a ticket to see Bela Fleck tomorrow night!!!!!!!!!!! Wowie wow wow. yeah. All I can say.  Friend of the Day: Josh Chappie

       heigh ho, the working life   it's 10:10 and I want to go to bed. I'm exhausted. I worked all day again today, picking up the clothes that people are too fucking inconsiderate to at least leave right-side out, if not on the hanger. Plus I have this bruise on my left hand, in between my thumb and forefinger, from putting hangers there while I hang other things up. The floor in the juniors section (who wears these clothes? they're terrible! so ugly. so tiny!) is crowded beyond belief with clothes racks so every time you walk by an overhung rack ten shirts fall off. AND, because lately the trend is to make shirts that aren't hanger-compatible, they fall off the hanger too. Hanging up women's suits and dresses is the worst. They're all heavy and awkward (i've tripped over a few), and they aren't sorted by brand like the rest of the store. They're sorted by something like fabric, or cut. Ri-goddamn-diculous.   Oh, yeah, and this is my favorite part: I left to go to the bathroom, on my way back folded some sweaters, and walked back into the dressing room to find that Hurricane PregnantWoman had been through, along with Tropical Storms OmigodSixteenYearOld and YoungJetSetTrendyWoman.  In ONE (1) dressing room, there was a pile of maternity clothes on the bench and a heap or two of blouses on the floor. ALL of the blouses were inside out. Several hangers were broken. All of the Misses stuff has to be taken back to the Misses section, and there's a fucking lot of it. I left it there. They can come and get it for all I care. The maternity stuff is easy enough except while I was sorting through one dressing room, ANOTHER pregnant woman came by and left a different dressing room in shambles. Now, the maternity section can't be more than a hundred feet long. It had to have been seriously depleted by this nightmare.   Not really diggin' the job so much. Let's say this, my feet hurt. I was walking and standing for eight hours. Yesterday too. My co-workers are nice, but it's not the kind of job where you get to stand around and chat because JC Penney has sale after sale after sale, and the bargain shoppers are endless. Everytime I go to put one pair of jeans back on the rack, another has shown up in its place. I feel like there is an appropriate metaphor for this phenomenom, but I can't recall it at the moment. Maybe something like removing grains of sand from a beach with a tweezer. Maybe that's it. Argh. Well, I do it again tomorrow and then I have two and a half days off. Neat-o. Because schools are closed I don't have to go in for coaching, so that's nice too. I'm a little bit worried that working such long hours will cost me a lot of practice time, especially since when I get home I just want to stare at the TV until I feel it is a reasonable time to retire. Sigh. Planning on campaigning for smaller chunks.   Today my moving back to Madison meter is leaning back over to going. I am especially missing Jerry and the comfort he would be giving me after such a long day. Being realistic is hard when you're lonely.

       lately, cleaning supplies are starting to seem a little...phallic?   The past two nights I've stayed up late to watch  urlLink Talk Sex  on Oxygen, I've seen a strange trend in cleaning supplies. Nevermind that Oxygen, while being a women's network, still plays on all the old stereotypes of who cleans the house, let's focus on these two products, shall we?   Lysol has come up with a handy new way to clean your toilet. Check  urlLink this  out. The Lysol Ready Brush allows you to squirt cleaning fluid from the tip by pressing the trigger at the base. A white foam emerges from the brush head.   Wow. Now if that ain't phallic, I don't know what is. Except maybe  urlLink  the Dawn Dish Brush , which makes cleaning those hard to reach places in glasses and such easier. The brush head also spins around. No white foam is ejaculated, unfortunately, but you get the picture.  The appearance of both of these ads during a sex show leads me to form the following conclusion: cleaning is definitely sexy! You'll like cleaning if you clean with a penis! Hurray! Or something like that. The Lysol brush cracks me up. They've gotta know what that looks like. C'mon, people. We're not dumbasses.    urlLink Davis  has done a blog about the recent MA ruling that the ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional. Chris, your state is awesome. Anyway, I would also like to do a blog on this but I'm afraid the eight hours I spent putting things on hangers today is preventing my brain from functioning properly. I would just like to say, where the hell do people get off being so goddamn bigoted? Gay people are obviously going to make you have sex with them, and then sodomize your children. If they get married, then we might as well just flush America down the toilet (and then clean it with the Lysol brush). Because God will strike us down with lightening and damnation.   FUCKING bastards. The more I think about it, the more 'separation of church and state' is a load of bullcrap. Bush keeps bringing biblical morals into everything, faith this and that. We say that we're a country of free citizens, but we can't marry whomever we want.  If gay marriage offends some people for religious reasons, they don't have to look. If they say that legalizing these unions will offend and disregard their personal religion, then they are bringing church into the state. If it offends you, look the other goddamn freakin' way! People need their rights, and if Christianity (or someone's messed up version of it) says that certain people are exempt from rights, then Christianity has no place in the US government. I think that we can embrace and use some of the religious mores that our country has been built on. Jesus taught some pretty kickass things, and accepted everyone. The greatest strength humankind has is the ability to shape society, and that means we can shape religion as well. Take the good stuff, and leave the bad, the bigoted, the obsolete. It is the reasonable, loving, common sense kind of thinking that will make our country a place for everyone.   Also. You. who insist that men and women get married to make babies. That. is the most inane justification for banning homosexual marriages I have ever heard.

       that's me, your jc penney recovery girl   tomorrow I start work at JC Penney picking up the shit people leave in piles in the dressing rooms. Yee-haw. It helps to have a family member in the business.  I took a long hike today, through Los Penasquitos Canyon. I hadn't been there before today, and it was beautiful! I walked three miles in to see the waterfall, ate lunch, and then walked back. So I'm sore, but happy. It was a gorgeous day and it was nice to explore. I will have to go back.   I'm giving a little more time to any major decisions such as moving. It's annoying even to me the way I keep wandering back and forth between yes and no, and I think it needs to simmer on the back burner. If I do stay here, I'm definitely getting an apartment. And I think that I'll make my grad school move in the summer, and get settled in. Moving back to Madison is actually starting to look a little like another sacrifice, kind of like Blue Lake, and I think I would regret giving up some of the coaching that I've been doing. Like I said, back burner. Updates as necessary.  I sent off my McGill ap yesterday, and UM will be sent off tomorrow (well, that's what I said I would do, but now that I'm starting at work I might finish it up at night and send it Saturday). That leaves me with just DePaul and ASU, and then financial aid stuff. Last night I FINALLY got to see Sean, and we chatted over dinner about music stuff. He put a lot of things in perspective for me (he tends to do that a lot). Mostly he told me that I shouldn't feel too bad about "wasting" so much time not practicing as an undergrad, because I shouldn't feel that I have to measure up to everyone else's standard of preparation. That maybe my undergrad years were more a time of social learning and having fun, and the real work begins now that I've matured and understand what needs to be done. I completely agree; right now I'm finally feeling the joy of playing and practicing and I can't wait to get back to work as a grad student. Afterward we played some duets and I ran through a little of the Stevens Sonata for him to hear. All's well in the trombone world.   Song that's been stuck in my head all day: Shrug, by Ani DiFranco Really good book I just finished: The Handmaid's Tale, by Margaret Atwood

       i don't really want to talk about this, but maybe i should   those of you wondering what was up with my Nov 16th post will now have your answer.   Despite my ill-advised efforts to keep up a long distance relationship with Jerry, things backfired on Sunday and we had a long and terrible phone conversation in which I pretty much freaked out and said I didn't want to talk for a long long time. That if it was going to be "over" in the sense that we weren't lovers anymore, then I needed some time to recover before I could be friends again.   Monday was miserable and I ended up doing an also ill-advised tearful "why can't we think of something better" phone call. I got schooled by Jerry, who didn't want to hear it. I don't blame him, although I did want some sensitivity.  I called back again, later, and asked if I moved back to Madison we'd be "together." No promises. I said I was planning on moving back. I feel like I'm going to vomit.   I'm standing here, at a crossroads, and I can't do anything but cry. Every decision I consider feels terribly wrong. I think about life without Jerry as my partner and things get fuzzy around the edges and look terribly dim. I think about moving back to Madison and I feel it would be foolish, because what new tortures would I be subjecting myself to? When I'm perfectly familiar with the tortures out here? When I think about staying here until I go to grad school, I want to shoot myself from the hours and months of boredom I foresee. I wish I hadn't ever taken this year off, but let's not dwell in the past. What good can I get out of this?   Well for one, it's time to face facts: Jerry and I had a great relationship. It's not going to work anymore, because our futures are going in different directions. If I move back then we have to do this again. I don't think I can do that. I accept the friendship he is offering. Sometimes you can love a person so much--but it just won't ever work out. Fate? Whatever. I'm afraid of a lot of silly things-how can I do better than Jerry? Afraid of being alone. Of never having that mental connection be so strong. Oh man. Laughter. Spooning. Smiles.  Regardless of my fears, I have to get past this. I learned a lot. I'm not proud of the person love and desperation have made me in the last couple of months. I'm having a hard time forgiving myself for things I've said and thought.   The hardest part is I feel like I have no one to lean on. All I really want is a hug, and a shoulder to cry on until I can get rid of all this pain and guilt and start new. I want someone to tell me that I'm strong, that I can get through this, that there are amazing things ahead. I can think this all to myself, but it's easier to doubt it. What if what if what now, what then, why not, how so, who?   Of course I don't need to define myself with a relationship. I can do better than that. I'm afraid. I'm confused. I'm tired of thinking. I'm tired of crying. I'm tired of being miles and miles away from of all of my friends. I'm tired of time passing and hopes and dreams.   I may not be here for a few days. This was difficult to write and I'm not sure if it's  good thing to post your personal despair on a public site. *sigh* I'm plugging through. I'll make it. Hopefully.

      i don't understand. why does it have to be this way? doesn't this kind of thing take work? i don't want it to end this way. i don't want it to end ever. but i guess that this is the only option-we've stopped listening to each other and we don't agree on what should be done. but i want to fight for this! i want it to work, i don't want to bow out gracefully. i don't have anything else right now. i don't have anything. now I have even less. what's left, life? anything else you want to throw back in my face? why don't you just stop now and give us all a break. fuck you.

       here's little miss posty   I keep forgetting to add this, but I have some other things I want for AKGPT day.  They all fall under the heading of Technology: Mini disc recorder and microphone Portable CD player, with car stereo adaptability (mine stopped working. maybe I shouldn't have stepped on it) Camera-digital? That would be cool. Either than or old school like Emily's Something fun from  urlLink Toys in Babeland  (Warning! do not click if you are sensitive to sexual matters or just plain don't want to see sex toys-whoops did I give it away? har har)  Pretty much these are all parent-type presents. Except of course for that last one. *snicker* Although I'd like to think that if I ever have a daughter I will be hip enough to give her a vibrator.

       welcome back mike zens!   I am very proud to welcome my dear old friend  urlLink Mikey  back to my link list. Let me say some good things about Mikey, because I like him a lot. He is a good guy. He and Katy make the cutest couple ever. For rizzle. To top off his intelligence he is also kind and understanding. He has an A+ giggle, which is one of my favorite characteristics in anybody.   Some of my memorable moments with Mike include: Trashcan random object catching Drawing sheep on bicycles  "Is that what you guys do at night?" That time I agreed to go running with him and couldn't walk for three days afterward  and, perhaps the best thing Mikey has ever done for me:  Snapped me out of my nervous pace-the-hallway almost-chickening-out attitude the day I asked Jerry out. Made me feel like I was awesome, Jerry was worth it, and that nothing ventured...is nothing gained.   Thanks Mike!  You're  awesome. You are Buddha Stew's friend of the day.

       DAMN YOU BLOGGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Well, it wasn't a particularly exciting or enlightening post anyhow.   Let's have a poll, shall we? I am considering moving back to Madison in January. What are your opinions on this? Please refrain from saying things like "Well you should do what makes you happy," and "Well I really can't make that decision for you." Sure you can. Go ahead, tell me what to do. My brain has stopped giving me advice.

       tonight i learned an important lesson   two months of living with parents, having few social engagements, and working with a long distance relationship finally caught up with me tonight. I snapped and beat the crap out of some innocent pillows and blankets.  let me tell you. It felt GREAT. It felt fucking awesome. I needed the release and there's nothing to get your adrenaline going like taking out all your anger. Afterward I collapsed on the floor and was greeted by my dog who was understandably baffled by my outburst. But I felt better. Cooped up energy is not good for you, especially when you're in a negative place emotionally.   and right now-my parents are off with the Loomises at a movie, and I get to listen to music loudly and dance about. Fuck all, ain't it! Of course none of my problems are effectively solved but at least I'm not moping. I would love to have company right now. But I'm not going to dwell on that because I will get angry and frustrated again. And I don't think my pillows would appreciate that.

       in which i provide you with another fun link to peruse, and some other stuff    urlLink God Forbid!!   Actually, I would love to have such a good and on-the-same-page relationship with my parents that I could allow them to freely read and comment on a webpage of mine. But it just isn't meant to be at this stage in life. Although my mom is not as ditzy as the one described in the article, she would comment on every little thing and probably disapprove of little things I said or thought. Hopefully she would also refrain from referencing me to all my relatives. *Sigh*Let's not get into the dad politics right now. I had a long day ("for once!", you all scream in relief) and this is what it looked like:    8:00 AM PST  Sectional coaching at Hidden Valley Middle School. One tuba, one treble clef baritone (my least favorite of the valved brass variety! for lazy converted trumpet players), and one trombonist. Plays too quietly, is pretty impressive actually, and doesn't know notes, respectively. Sectional goes okay although I hate working on Christmas medleys (is that how you spell the plural of medley?) and wish I could take young trombonist aside and teach to play properly. The happiest part is that I got a check! Hurray for that $70 dollars! That's half of my trip to Madison right there. Well, not half, maybe not even a third, but I like to think positively.    12:20 PM PST  The time I was supposed to arrive at Ramona High School for sectional coaching. Such event did not occur as traffic cops at Poway Rd and Espola directed me back INTO Poway instead of happily on my way up the Poway grade to 67 which would transport me efficiently and dutifully into Ramona in half an hour's time. Lauren hauls ass up to 78 only to realize that 78E is ANNOYING AS FUCK and traipses blithely all about Escondido before getting down to its real business of directing people into Ramona. I had also lacked the presence of mind to recall that 78 is easily reached via San Pasqual Valley Road, thereby avoiding all the Escondido sightsee-ery.    1:30 PM PST  The time I actually arrive at RHS, home of the Bulldogs. There was much confusion in actually  finding  the school, as I was led astray by a decoy stadium and directions that pertained only to my having arrived on the 67 as planned. Anyway, I missed the first period of low brass (don't worry, more on them later) but arrived just in time to coach a worthy young man by the name of Dave and his contra. I was jubilant to discover that he had "young blood brass" scribbled on his marching band music, and happy to offer him assistance in getting hold of their music as he expressed difficulty in doing so. Dave and I explore the many facets of brass playing and he proves to be an exceptional kid and a decent player. Daniel James, the director, asks me to stay and coach an after school sectional with the three players I missed while touring the neighborhoods of urban Ramona. (A side note: both Daniel and Jeff, the HVMS director, are very cute in that late twentysomething band director kind of way. I likey) So I agree, and I am subjected to an hour and a half of frustration with the Three Stooges. Freshman, in other words. Freshman boys. Let's not get into the details, for I am afraid reliving the experience would cause me a few gray hairs.    4:00 PM PST  I am released from my torture and free to return to RB where I can relax in peace. Somewhat. My way home (properly, on 67) turns into a tour of the mast extent of the fire damage. Entire hillsides are blackened and I can see the places where houses used to be. It is very humbling. I am grateful that we were spared and I hope that the rebuilding process is not too draining for the victims. At home as usual the TV is on loudly (are my parents going deaf? i think so) and I just want to crawl into my room and subsequently into a book. Which I do. Until I realize that the food items I have at my disposal are unappetizing at this point in time and my parents provide little else to nuture a vegetarian. They are, for example, having hamburgers for dinner. So...   7:00 PM PST  I head off to China Fun and purchase veggie lo mein. Yummers. I eat and then go to Borders which has become my favored escape from the sounds of TV. Plus, I get chai and I get to look at books and music. I like Borders and I don't care if I'm selling out. They do an okay job for a corporation. Anyway, at Borders I start making a mental list of...   Things I want for AKGPT Day*  Books: Manifesta, Richards and Baumgardner Fast Food Nation, Eric Schl....please forgive me I'm too lazy to look up last names Nickled and Dimed, Barbara Erleinbach?--ditto to above Pink Think, Lynn Peril Stupid White Men, Michael Moore Skipping Toward Gomorrah, Dan Savage (thanks to Adam for reminding me)  Movies:  The Hours Bend it like Beckham  Music: Ani Difranco--it occurred to me the other day that although I am a big fan, my ani      listening was always Jerry-sponsored, and thus I have none of her cds except Evolve Brahms German Requiem Shostakovich and Bartok string quartets Prokofiev anything (although I have lots already-you can't get enough of good old Proky!) Mahler (my collection is severely lacking in Mahler goodness!) Bend it Like Beckham soundtrack  *sigh* I would buy all of these things had I the money. I would check out the books from the library if they had them, which they might, but I haven't looked yet. But-both of my parents have birthdays soon and I also completely neglected their anniversary last month.   Oh yeah-*Atheist Kids Get Presents Too. I didn't make that up. I read it somewhere and now I can't remember where. I think it's hilarious. For those of us who've lost the Christmas spirit but still want the goodies.   post spellcheck note: how is Prokofiev in the blogger dictionary but Shostakovich is not? I find that a little weird. Not that Shostakovich isn't in the spellchecker but that even Prokofiev is, when he is generally ranked under Shosty in terms of popularity. Oh well. Go Sergei! You are my dream date, you big hunk(ok, really skinny and weird looking) o' man you!

       now that's just cruel...   I flipped to FM 92.1 on my car radio dial, expecting to hear their usual dose of bad popular rock/punk, and instead got KSON. Country. They turned an independent rock station into a country station? WTF, mate? Think of all the poor San Diegans (mostly males, aged 14-30) who are crying into their pillows today because they can no longer hear the latest Puddle of Mudd. Instead they were forced to listen baffled to 30 seconds of Toby Keith or what have you before they regained the presence of mind to switch to the safety of 91X. This is a travesty, I tell you. There is now a great hole in the middle of what was once the "Great 90s" for when you press seek from 91X you have to go all the way up to 94.9 before you get even some semblance of rock music. Even 93.3 in the middle cannot quell the sorrow, for its collection of bad hiphop and top 40 is no match for the giant that has today fallen, 92.1. Oh the humanity!!!  Actually, despite the dripping sarcasm, I am a little sad, and I'm wondering if they've relocated on the dial. It was one of the last radio stations in SD that wasn't a Clear Channel ass-whupped media mouthpiece. *Sigh* Well, I'll continue with my practice of recycling my tapes of Beatles albums through my tape deck. Maybe even pull out the time-tested En Vogue "Funky Divas" album. And shed a tear, just like that Native American guy did when we trashed his land. Or not.

       well, ain't the internet something?    urlLink  Margaret Cho   has a blog. Kick ass, man! She is so damn hilarious.   I had a funny thought this morning while I was lying in bed waiting for my uncle to be done with the bathroom so I could pee. You know how sometimes guys'll have contests seeing who can grow the best beard? I think women should start having "Best Leg Hair" or "Best Armpit Hair" contests. I think that would be hilarious and maybe even help teach people that woman hair is NOT bad. Plus, you wouldn't get those nasty red shaving bumps for a while.   Well I did promise that I would revise my manifesta. I'm still working on it. Unfortunately right now I have to concentrate on a lot of other things- getting my applications done, writing my personal statement, studying for the GRE, and planning my late December recital. Perhaps somewhere in there I will take a break and get all bitchy again. Sweet.   I am still waiting to hear about this stupid lifeguarding job. I hope it's today, although I have a sinking feeling that they will not hire me. If they do not, I will go ahead and take that Cuban band gig in TJ. Hey, why not? It's money baby, and it gets me out of the house three days a week. Plus it gets me out of doing the terrible terrible youth band thing that I agreed to do. Wait-okay, it's not that terrible. The only terrible thing about it is the two people running it. Mostly Don, the old guy. As I mentioned to Felicia, if you're shakin' you ain't got no place keeping time. Also, "ready, play" doesn't always work so hot. And I get the feeling that Betsy's kind of insane. She gave me like eight hugs in the two hours I was there. The kids are great, and Kyle and Tea seem nice. I think you could do a lot with the band, and it just isn't happening because you can only milk so much knowledge of music out of the same four armed forces marches. (Not to mention my immediate distaste for the glorification of the armed forces and also marches in general)  *sigh* Well, I've got to put together this packet for Profs Smith and Richardson, so they can recommend me into a good music program. ASU is pissing me off for not getting directly back to me with simple information, such as APPLICATION DATES and whether or not recommendation letters are REQUIRED. Fuck fuck fuck. The problem is I really do want to go there, as it is one of my top choices and all. So I don't want to screw up the application. Unfortunately the website has the honor of being extremely uninformative. Typical. Okay, enough bitching, fuck them, I'm going to Montreal, baby! yeah!

       keeping americans living in fear one high school student at a time    urlLink Here's  another ode to stupidity and conservatism.  Hm, what topic out of the many that come to mind when reading about this event should I discuss? Drug culture and our various reactions to it? Police abusing their privileges? Creating an environment in which teenagers can feel trusted and responsible? The education system as a whole-do we consider schools the places that should police our children? Are schools a place where kids can feel comfortable and open? (consider my own high school and the infamous  urlLink panty raid ) Or- hell, why not violate civil rights? It's fun, yeah?   One of Jerry's favorite things to say about drugs goes along these lines: "I was the star student in my school's DARE program, and two years later I was smoking pot." Pretty telling eh? I'm using Jerry as an example because my own shy, non-rebellious teenagerhood doesn't give me any depth of experience. I'm wondering which is more compelling- that DARE and other drug resistance programs don't really "keep kids off drugs," or that we often use scare tactics to educate rather than helping ALL kids to be self-sufficient and self-confident and make their own decisions (while also giving them a real, honest teaching on drugs and addiction).   Now, before you go jumping on my back and saying, "Of course drugs are bad! Do you want our children to become a nation of addicts?" allow me to defend myself. If you raise a child to be confident, responsible, and free-thinking, all the while trusting them to make their own choices and educating them with honest facts, you will likely get an adult (or teenager) who can take things into perspective. If you have an ad campaign that is based on wrongful facts (take the current ad campaign against marijuana- I heard tell of one commercial that said smoking weed led one kid to shoot his best friend in an argument-any of you feel like a shoot out when you smoke up? To me that seems contrary to the effects of a pot high) and scare tactics combined with a generation of kids whose parents are afraid to let them make their own decisions, I predict you will get a fair amount of kids doing drugs.   And do you think this is fair: It is admitted that alcohol and tobacco are just as addicting as most drugs on the market. Like drugs, they create a dependency on an outside stimulant. Yet every day we are bombarded by ads for beer and cigarettes that are perfectly legal. So what message are we sending to kids? "Well, cocaine'll kill you so don't do it. Look at all these pictures of people that have been made  terribly  ugly by cocaine. Oh, but once you're 21*, party like a frat boy and get all the hot chicks with your can of Bud Light!!" (*Oh but we don't care if you do it before, as long as we make money)  I don't think the problem is that alcohol and tobacco shouldn't be legal. I think the problem is choice. Do we have the choice to an education about drugs and their real effects that also allows us to make the decision for ourselves? Or are we presented with scare tactics and false facts when we don't have a choice in the first place?   Disclaimer- I have no real experience with illegal drug use. As I said before I led a happy childhood terrified that someone would offer me drugs and would turn me into nasty slut that got bad grades. I am admittedly underresearched on the topic and am mostly just speculating. To my knowledge my DARE program gave me accurate facts about what would happen to me should I become addicted to heroin. However, I remain insulted by the fact that they chose to present me with these facts in a way that intimated that should I become addicted to heroin I would die a painful and lonely death. That drug addicts are terrible people with evil eyes and bloody noses, and get bad grades. Where's the love, people? Can't we all just get along?    special! two rants for the price of one!    that's right me lovelies. I have one more thing to rant about, but I'll keep this one short, I promise.   I  DESPISE  blanket racist statements such as this one: "Well, it's a nice neighborhood. I suppose you don't get many hispanics? Or are they everywhere these days?"  Makes your blood boil, doesn't it? But, I am ashamed to admit that it came out of the mouth of someone I dearly respect, my uncle Dick.   Makes me want to respond to this later statement- "Well I guess I did see a few Mexicans"- "Oh really? And they weren't stealing or shooting each other? Good lord! What kind of Mexicans are they? Are they dangerous? Should we pass a law about it? Oh dear Lord! I can feel my white privilege slipping as we speak!"  *sigh* Again I say, can't we all just get along?

       lauren, queen of html   or...not really, but at least I'm smart enough to follow instructions and to pick out matching colors. Thanks to  urlLink  BlogSpeak   I now have a comment function! It is compatable with Blogger and requires little maintence. Please use it wisely and post only constructive criticism or positive remarks. I will remove any posts I feel are hateful or contain offensive remarks.  I don't want no trolls!   In the process of adding my comment function I learned that HTML is not as scary as I was previously led to believe. In fact, I am perfectly capable of fixing the problems that arose whilst adding the code. Hurray for me! Now comment, people, or I shall be forced to keeeel you. Like a boat. keel. har har. oh never mind.

       thank you, moopheus    urlLink  This   is hilarious. Check it out. Go PETA! hehe. I think it would have been even better if they'd made "Leo's" voice a little more Bill and Ted, you know?   anyway, that brings me to the point where I think, well with all this other activism stuff I've got going on, why not go green as well? I pretty much already am. Makes pooping easier (Jerry will attest). Right now I'm on sort of a "well I won't buy or make meat for myself but oh, okay, you made a steak? Right on" kind of diet. Hmm. Some cogitating will be done on this.   I have some revisions to make to my Manifesta, which will be arriving in due time and with the necessary research completed. I'm planning on changing my stance a little, and refocusing some energy on different things. Further reading: Gloria Steinem's piece "Sex Lies and Advertising," which I found in her book  Moving Beyond Words . I won't give anything away-tune in later for more.   Rock on. Today I've promised myself a practice session, something that I've been avoiding for a week and a half. Gotta find the love in the trombone man-gotta snap out of the laziness.

       for those of you who were wondering my opinion...   on NBC's new reality tv show  urlLink  Average Joe  .  Last night I was flipping channels and came across this program. I must admit I watched it with some amount of fascination. The premise, if you are unaware, is that one lovely lady will have a chance to pick her "dream guy" from a cast of 16, ala Joe Millionaire. Unfortunately, as the website states, "the joke's on her" because her dream guys are less than beautiful. The show is playing a prank on Melana, who is advertised as being every hetero man's dream girl- a "former NFL cheerleader and beauty queen"-and who was also quoted as saying that she was "looking for a good personality."  Well, Melana has stood up to my expectations and proven herself to be a genuine person-although the camera made much of her initial reaction to seeing an "average" slightly overweight and shiny-skinned man step out of the limo, she remained gracious and friendly throughout the evening. She seems like a great woman, funny, intelligent, and understanding. I think she realized that the show was playing a joke on her and she decided to make the best of it and shove it back in their faces. Those viewers who are looking for the stereotype of a catty, shallow beautiful woman will not find it in Melana.   Now, as far as my opinions on the premise of the show go, let's jump right in, shall we? It's a terrible idea and just one more indication of how far our culture of beauty has gone to make people feel bad about being "average." And that placing a beautiful woman in the company of 16 self-admitted "geeks" and "nerds" who have been played up to be slightly less than Prince Charming is ample material for humor and sensationalism in today's society. Because we all know that beauty and average cannot co-exist. While being terribly insulting to the contestants (were I in their place I would certainly consider breaking contract), it is also insulting to the girl herself by assuming that she will prove the stereotypes about her.   But perhaps the producers did expect Melana to be gracious and friendly. In this case they are challenging society's impressions of "average" and "beautiful." Maybe they are "average joes" themselves and want to see the "nice guy finish first." But that also assumes that "nice" and "gorgeous" are mutually exclusive, while these guys being ugly or fat makes them the cream of the emotional crop (never mind that one guy's comment "oh yeah, I'm gonna get some hot ass"). I think the whole premise is faulty, and it is up to Melana to prove that none of these things are important. Unfortunately, I can see how this will all get blown out of proportion and a huge deal will be made out of "beauty and the beast" or whatnot. Because our stereotypes and enforced cultural opinions on beauty are steeped in a long tradition of financial backing. But I won't get into that and you can read my Nov 7th post for more. :)   Interesting to think how this would work if reversed. Consider several different options.   1. Keep the same sixteen "unattractive" men (although I consider  urlLink Tareq  to be rather dashing and handsome...perhaps it's because he's not white that he's an "average joe") but find a woman that doesn't meet cultural standards of beauty. Someone who wasn't a beauty queen. Put me in there for example. Measure me up to the beauty myth and you'll find I don't fit. Will those men be equally as gracious as Melana was to them? Or will they be disappointed and angry? Consider that standards of beauty are much harsher for women. What then?  2. One dashing man and sixteen "Average Janes." Some pudgy, some flat-chested, some with less than perfect skin. Again, would the star be gracious and open-minded? Would women stand for their treatment as "average," perhaps seeking drastic ways of conforming to the beauty myth, or would they protest being called "average" and be confident in their beautiful personalities to win the hunk's heart?   3. Sixteen gorgeous women and a less than perfect hero. Again, think about what the reactions might be. Would the hero see himself as king of a cast of beauties? Would he objectify the women or feel insecure in his charm? Again, what price, open-mindedness?  Of course, 1 and 2 would not work because Average Janes are not given any media attention, and are basically denied the right to exist. Woman must be a trophy-and who wants a tarnished or ill-made trophy? Note the contestants' collective excitement that Melana is beautiful. Were they expecting anything less?   What I have learned from this scenario is that we are paying a heady price for our own body images, and for setting up ideals and sacrificing those who don't fit to the category of "average." There is something fundamentally wrong with a culture than can take two people who are intelligent, caring, humorous and open-minded-some of the best characteristics of the human race-and set them apart from each other because one is "beautiful" and the other "average." It is also telling of how the beauty myth is seeping into men's space as well, and how soon we might all be consumed.   I really have to get a comment function on this thing. I'd love to hear your thoughts. an email, perhaps.

       dear father: several reasons that prove you to be a tremendous asshole    In this open letter to my father (which he will never read, as I will prove that he has wholly disregarded and disrespected my capacity for rational thought and thus this would be a paradox for him) I will explore the many reasons which I feel have separated my father and I to this current state of emotional distance.  This blog is sponsored by the following adventure in Husting family politics: At dinner this evening, with my uncle Dick as our honored guest, my dad made some crack, I don't remember the context, to the lines of "Ich bien ein Deutchlander" (i apologize profusely to Bethany, Davis, Grant, and anyone else who reads this with any knowledge of German). I laughed and said, "Like I am a donut!" Because I remember someone telling me that JFK's famous "Ich bien ein Berliner" really meant "I am a donut." Well apparently this found offense in my father's ears.  This is not hard to do. He said "What?!?" and I said, "Never mind, pass the hot dog buns." And then he got offended. So I attempted to explain myself, saying that someone had told me that JFK's German was incorrect and that it really meant, "I am a donut" (that still cracks me up). But I can hardly get a word in edgewise before he starts rattling off about how he knows German better than I and that I've insulted him and la-di-fucking-da. So witness the two of us, cut of the same stubborn cloth, plowing forth on our respective rants and not paying any mind to the other. I win! No really, I got the laughs. That's right. Lauren wins.   Here comes the point where I say: Why does my relationship with my father have to be a contest of wills? What's his deal? Okay-since the argument (I didn't post about this, but before I left for Wisconsin my dad and I had the long awaited confrontation which I lost, because my stubborn cloth is interwoven with non-confrontation cloth), I have admittedly changed my tune and done my best to endure my dad's lectures, racist statements, faulty politics, and patriarchal attitudes. I have had conversation with him about the events of my day. I have smiled and said good morning. Hurrah. I have put up with dirty countertops and urgings to "help mom out around the house."   What it comes down to is this:  I refuse to be put into a situation with my own father, who should love me and want to hear my opinion on things, in which my opinion is instead devalued and debunked merely on the basis of it being contrary and hostile to his own. I reserve my right to liberal thinking opinions and non-racist policies. I did not vote for Arnold. Go to hell. You are a crabby and obnoxious pig-headed old man and although I am required to love you, I am not happy with you. Deal with it. You're not frigging perfect. Neither am I. But I have the good sense to listen to someone finish talking before I assume anything about the content of their speech.   Dearest BS readers, I am sorry for the intense content of the past couple blogs. I promise next time I will post something more lighthearted, like a picture of a kitty stuck in a hammock. Until then, please accept my sincerest apologies. Or, kindly fuck off. Thank you.

       i am hatching an evil feminist plot   mwahahaha. Oh yes. I am hatching a plot. It is very exciting. The first stage of this plot is this:   To my friends who read this:  I have decided to do a personal boycott of the beauty industry. By that, I mean the vast majority of women's magazines such as Cosmo, Elle, YM, Seventeen, Marie-Claire, Redbook, etc etc etc. I will also include all beauty products that use advertisements to tell women that they can "change" or "lose weight" or "look sexier."  I include such products that have no medical basis for improving skin care or "firming cellulite." or otherwise in my boycott. I include diet drugs, diet programs and exercise fads. Cosmetic surgery. Clothing companies that only cater to one body type and season after season reduce their sizes and designs. Movies that portray stereotyped and typical women's roles. That hire anorexic actresses. That promote myths about men's "aggressiveness" and women's "submissiveness." Pornography.   I promise to support financially and vocally the counters to these items: magazines that promote positive self-image and achievement, such as  urlLink  Bitch  ,  urlLink  Bust  , and  urlLink  Ms.   There are many others, and they deserve support. I promise to promote a healthy sexual outlook in people whenever I get the opportunity, to never deny a teenager the right to knowledge or advice. I promise to let stores that cater to the Beauty Myth know that there needs to be a standard of measurement for women's clothes that includes body types of all shapes. I will support the erotica industry, which promotes loving sexual relationships, or at least equal and non-violent sexual relationships, instead of the violence and misogyny of the pornography industry.   This list could go on and on. Most of you who know me understand that I have been doing this anyway. So why make the statement now? The answer is this: What I am asking my dear Buddha Stew readers is that you join me. I ask that you, too, decline from participating in the beauty myth and make your own personal statement. I know that most of you have a positive outlook on body image, so even if you read a women's magazine for kicks, or just to look, please consider the damage that they do to others and remove your money from their pockets. If you enjoy pornography, perhaps you would consider looking for something that is less violent or unrealistic. Refrain from judging a person on their appearance or clothing until you get a glimpse of their mind and personality. See the beauty in humanity. Realize that in our consumer culture these industries depend on the insecurities they create to keep the money pouring in. The best way to make a stand here to is to take away financial support. Perhaps then they'll take notice.   There are so many things I'd like to be active in protesting: sexism, ageism, heterosexism, racism, sizeism, the list goes on. I feel that in making my stand against the beauty industry I can cover all of these. For example:   The beauty industry is sexist: it targets women and creates a consumer culture that keeps many from developing their minds beyond worries of weight and appearance. That puts woman at the mercy of how man sees her.   The beauty industry is ageist: it promotes cosmetic surgery of all kinds that reduces the natural effects of aging and denies it a beauty of its own. It denies women a life after 30.   The beauty industry is heterosexist: it feeds on images of "how to please your man" and "the best sexual positions" (read: intercourse). It denies information on alternate sexual experiences.  The beauty industry is racist: consistently white actresses and models appear as cover girls, black models are reserved for months when magazines don't generally "sell as well." Blonde and blue-eyed are beautiful and ideal.  The beauty industry is sizeist: it relies on an ever decreasing waist size to model its fashions. It denies women with curves the right to enjoy their bodies and feel sexy.   I believe in a feminism that allows you the right to choose your path. Of course great progress has been made in allowing women access to public spheres. You don't have to be a housewife if you don't want to. You can be a housewife if you want to. You can be sexually active, lesbian, bisexual, virgin or just plain asexual. But don't be fooled into thinking that feminism is done, that it's served its purpose and retired into history. The beauty industry is part of an intense backlash against women's liberation, an effort to block social change and keep the money pouring into the right pockets. Someone is afraid that women can change the world-and they're right, they can. Whatever version of inequality you look into, be it racial or gendered, classist or sexual, you'll notice this similarity: inequality requires a system of control. Control can translate into capitalism (go ahead, call me a crazy socialist psychopath :), warfare, religious fundamentalism. Control is important to those people who benefit from it, and in our society it happens to be white men. Thus these interests that I express are dangerous to them, because it means  change . It means giving up power and admitting to wrongs and having to explain their actions for the past thousands of years. It means admiring all people as people first and ethnic and gender groups last. And losing money.  This is probably, at first read, a complex tangle of every theory I've ever had or read about and assimilated. I want to explain that I consider every action of inequality to be of equal importance and equally deserving of action. I want to do my part, and this is it. I am taking a small step: the personal is political. Change on the national level is hardly worth dreaming about, but with a few small actions multiplied-well, maybe you can dream. So, if you've made it this far without falling asleep or getting pissed off at me, please consider what I am asking, and send me an email if you support it (please no hate mail, although I will gladly take suggestions or concerns). I want both women and men to take a stand on this. I'm not a man-hater; you all know this. That's not feminism. Don't be afraid to challenge the system. All of this depends on money-you have it, and you get to choose where it goes. Please choose wisely.

       here i go again   back in ye olde san diego. bummer. shit sandwich. fartnuggets.  no, it's okay I think. I am feeling refreshed from my trip and hopefully the happiness will carry me a little longer this time. I've decided to go ahead and do all my grad school stuff, get that out of the way, and concentrate on life. I'm thinking maybe that a move back to Madison is in my future, in January perhaps. In this way (here comes the justification) I may more easily travel to my upcoming auditions in the midwest. This is a rather weak justification. Actually I am questioning my needing to justify it at all. Let's just put it this way: I want to be with Jerry. In being with Jerry I find that I can stop focusing on how I am not with Jerry and focus on how I want my life to be. It's like a reprieve, a retreat from the stark hysterical nights I spend trying to decide the nature and strength of love. In other words, putting myself back into a comfortable situation will help me to make a more complete decision about what happens next. Does this make sense? No one think I'm ducking out here? Or giving up? Well it's possible it won't happen. I know I can do it without Jerry, already I know that the months ahead are not going to be as hard as the past two. Hard nevertheless, but still I have an understanding of what reserves they will take.   I am also coming to understand that it is entirely unreasonable of me to require Jerry to make any decisions concerning the future. I remember what it's like; college seems so protected and distant that it's easy to push off decisions until the last possible instant. Also it is not my life to control. Any and all directions that he may choose to go in are under his command, and his only. I may feel sometimes like I deserve a little effort from him, but I have to remember that this is the part of me that wants a little payback for giving up my summer to spend with him at Blue Lake. The selfish part of me. The part of me that ignores the fact that I made that decision and was not in any way coerced or guilted into going. Except by myself, of course.   Basically it comes to this: I'm deciding on the molecular level right now that I want to reinvent my life. To chance focus. So I become insecure about the things that I've set myself up to do: performance, trombone, music etc. What I am left with is my relationship with Jerry being the only real true understood thing. I need to start from that point and go outward. I need to re-evaluate and take things as they come. For now I should not push the relationship envelope, because that it what weakens it. I need to use the strength that comes from it, and the power that it has, as a safe haven. All things will come from here. This too shall pass.

       in which i am feeling very conflicted   hello all. I am in Madison and happy to be so! It's fall and I love it. Hats and mittens, hurrah! It is wonderful to see everyone so far. Haven't done too much but I think that's fine, just the fact of being here is making me feel calmer and happier. Went to Mikey's Hallowe'en party last night as Rosie the Riveter, and was very surprised that people got it right away! It was the cheapest and easiest costume ever, and the most successful. A lesson learned. Today I walked around, bought two candles at the Farmer's Market, and browsed through A Room of One's Own, Exclusive Company, any stores that I miss, etc. I stopped in the Humanities bldg to pee and talked to Dan Henkel for a few minutes. Otherwise the bldg was pretty deserted. Ha-rumph. I would like to make the best of my time by hanging out with folks, but I'll take what I get. Tomorrow I will see Katie and Cara's recitals, and maybe go to the SAI meeting. Monday I have my lesson with James Campbell, so I need to practice for that.   In respect to my title, I am feeling conflicted because I know I am happy here, and that I am unhappy in San Diego. I want to move back. But should I give up on some of the seeds I've sown in Ca to start all over here? Is it too late? Would people think me strange or weak? Can I even afford it-would I get a job? Am I doing it for Jerry or for myself (well, I can answer that one, it would be for myself because I need to have Jerry around, selfishly)? Anyway, lots of people mention my desire to leave that I expressed often last spring and ask me if I would regret coming back here because I would feel trapped again. I don't think so. What I regret is leaving. But now I have to decide if I consider this "giving up" and going back to a comfortable situation, or if I consider it doing what is best for my mental and emotional health. Also, I argue that moving back here would not be entirely comfortable, as I would have to reestablish myself, find job, apt, furniture, etc. I dunno. I might come back in the summer if it turns out my grad school is out here.  I would also like to talk to Jerry about how we see each other in the future. I don't feel like I would be compromising any of my goals or dreams to make room for him in my future. I just think it's something to consider-when you find someone you love, isn't it silly to give it up? We have a few options and I would like to discuss them.  Well, I'm going to practice a bit and then hit the town for dinner. Yum yum, Himal Chuli :)

       internet fun   What hidden messages does your name hold? Go  urlLink here  to find out.   I find it incredibly cool that you can form the words "laughter," "sunlight," "sleuth," and "lutheran" from letters of my name.   My favorites:  "hungriest ulan"- yep, that's me. I've always been an Ulan with an appetite. "lutheran suing"-I guess it's in my future that I weasel some money of out my church. "Guthrie annuls"-Woody has broken up with me, apparently. "hauler gnu tins"-my fortune made delivering packaged African undulates. "hunger anus lit"- I'll let you come to your own conclusions. "hunger lust ian"-It's true, I'm a cannibal and Melrose has always looked good enough to eat. "hauser gun lint"-I really gotta clean that thing before I use it next. "haunts rug line"-My ghost doesn't like bad toupees. "haunting rules"-yes, yes it does. whooooooooo "inhales rug nut"-five second rule applies. "lighten uranus"-I can take that two ways. Only one is camp appropriate.  I will now spend the next hour putting your names into the anagram machine. Happy Fucking New Year. :)

       conundrum   I am continuously baffled by my father's inability to do anything work or cleaning related by himself. It seems that if there are dishes to be done, carpets to be vacuumed, or gardens to be dug up, they require assistance. Sometimes it's "Let's help Mom out and..." or "we should do the dishes before Mom gets home," which infuriates my feminist edge to no end (because it's assumed that cleaning is her job, that these are the things she cares about only otherwise we'd have a dirty floor and nasty toilets). I guess it's just that watching ten hours of TV a day really takes it out of you, that latest rerun of Matlock sure was a shocker, golly, I hope I can lift this dirty pot over here to the sink without...oh shit. Lauren! Come give me a hand with this!  I've thought fleetingly that he's just reaching out to spend time with me. But more and more I see that he's just a big lazy ass, and becoming a househusband would be beneath him and the compensation/benefits success that he was. And I suppose it was ridiculous of me to assume that he wanted something else to do.  Today he came home complaining about the rough day he had at the golf course. Working. Dealing with people. And having to do it again tomorrow.   Let's just stop there and think about that for a second. Working two days in a row?  Two?  In a  row?  Why, that could take years off his life! Endanger his capacity for creativity and free thought! He said he'd have to find another job if he had more days like today.  Good luck buddy. We're in the same damn boat. We've both got college degrees and good heads on our shoulders, and right now, we're just wage slaves. If I can't find a fucking job doing something I've been trained to do, and do well, then will you do any better? You've considered working an office job, but I guarantee you'll be working every day. Dealing with people. Inside, as opposed to outside, putting around in a golf cart.   The problem here is he's left the work-a-day world and has become accustomed to the sedentary life. I'm experiencing it too- even though I was bored and frustrated sitting at home everyday, Penney's made me want it back bad. I want more for my father. I sincerely hope he's not going to spend the next twenty plus years of his life sitting on his ass watching Murder, She Wrote and bugging me about things I'm perfectly capable of taking care of on my own. The problem is I can't communicate this to him. Communication is not a thing we do, it's not washing dishes. I can't even look sidewise and I get bitched at. Make a joke or have an opinion. It's ri-goddamn-diculous.   When did it get this bad? Is this why my mom works full-time? Is there hope for the Husting family?

       ups, ups, and mostly ups   except that I'm hungry and have no food to make, that's a down.   Christmas=business as usual. Best present: two vegetarian cookbooks. Have made sole New Year's resolution to make a new recipe at least once a week, more if possible.   Jerry's visit is official! Jan 8-17th. This puts most of his visit right smack dab in the middle of recital stress, but that's okay-this isn't a big recital and I think it'll be good. Plus, it's my Jerry! I'm absolutely thrilled and glad it's only a week and a half away. There will be much smooching the week of Jan 8th.  Jerry is also selling/giving me his mini disc player-which means I no longer need to stress about recording my recital and I can start right off doing high quality recordings of my practice sessions and make tapes and so on. I need to buy a microphone, but that I can handle.   We finally made it to the Pacific Beach Bar and Grill-a place that has always been on the list of places to go. Marisa, Sarah and I rode down, met up with Natasha and Mary, and had a general good time. Very very nice place- A+ bathrooms and bar service, not sketchy at all (ie well lit but not annoyingly so), etc. Funny incidents with drunk men. Although I enjoy a good flirt, I do hate the guys that try so hard to hit on your particular group of friends, like "I noticed you ladies sitting alone" bullshit and cheesy crap like that. There should be some designated pattern to flirt initiation. Otherwise, I want to be left "alone" with my friends.   Shopping/dinner with Katie yesterday, and I got awesome pants. Fabulous pants. The bestest.   Work today, and hopefully my second-to-last day! I work again New Year's Eve, but only til 8. Have no plans as of yet for NY. Perhaps downtown again? Or throw a party? We'll see.  Well, I haven't much else to say. I did have a good time at work today joking with Britni, quality time making fun of the music videos. Life is good.

       i knew it!!   I knew that somewhere out there I had a God-fearing, child-beating, elegant apostrophe-using  urlLink relative   that hated the glossiness of the Christmas season as much as I. It's so nice to have family this time of year, isn't it?   Your Christmas Eve, Fifth Night of Hannukah, Two Days before Kwaanza Update:  Don't ever work in a department store if you can help it! Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday I worked til close. And there were still people clamoring for those last minute gifts. We had to practically push them out the door. Plus, I almost cried several times at both the amount of clothes I had to put away and the terrible mess that the sales floor was rapidly becoming despite my best efforts to tidy it.   I refuse to let this job get to me, however. I am much better than this job, much smarter, much more talented, and therefore I have better things to piss me off. It's a pain in the neck. How could it not be? People are slobs, rude, ignorant, callous slobs when it comes to their personal experiences. I would like to sit every teenage girl that comes into the fitting room down and have a long chat about how someday they might be stuck working minimum wage picking up someone's mess, and they should take heed and respect the people that do it now.   I've listened in on a few conversations at work, between women, about how they feel they don't have to work as hard in life because they'll have a man to make up the difference. I have bit my tongue for all of these conversations, but I will not rant about feminism right now, much to your chagrin. I'm just baffled by this-there's nothing that makes me feel better about myself than knowing I can take care of my own needs without having to rely on anyone else. While at this point in time I do require the assistance of my parents, I am looking forward to the day I be totally self-sufficient. Sure, a little free money is nice every now and again, but I like not having to be grateful to anyone.   I just had some nasty-ass packaged alfredo pasta mix.   Hung out with Marisa and Sarah last night-we went to a bar by Marisa's house that turned out to be the happeningest place in RB. Or rather, it was like a high school reunion. One guy sat down to talk to us and asked "RB or Poway?" We saw Joey Brennan, Patsy Martin, Chris Bloom, and some random annoying girls that played soccer with Marisa. And I swear one of the Haas brothers had to have been there because I followed this car all the way home and it stopped two doors down...it's probably Tom.   It was weird for me because most of these people I don't remember at all. I mean, I swam with Joey for almost ten years but still had trouble recognizing him. Also, I was a complete and total band-o. Should I run into anyone from band--now that would be a reunion. Plus, I remember the people I want to remember. Patsy Martin has had no known direct effect on my life as I know (except for the pleasure I get out of how her name sounds like meat), and I consider that grounds for mental dismissal. Oh well. Joey gets an award for growing up to be hotter than before.  Tomorrow my parents and I are seeing the final LOTR. It's the culmination of a three-year Christmas day tradition, because we can't socialize long enough to not piss each other off but we still feel obligated to spend quality time together. Three and a half hour movie? Bingo.   To my readers: a tasty and accumulative holiday. Cheers!

       because you can't look like a teenager forever...   Recently I inexplicably received a magazine from the lady who gave me a massage last winter. It's one of those yuppie incense-burning, expensive-yoga-mat, which-mountain-retreat-should-you-pamper-yourself-at-this-January kind of magazines, but I looked through it anyway.   Surprisingly, it told me something that intrigued me: you can use lemon juice as an effective facial cleanser. Like, really, really effective. I was a little skeptical (it says the acid is akin to giving yourself a mini facial peel), but I gave it a try since my skin has been incredibly willful since returning to San Diego. It works! My skin is pretty, not angry and pimply! I am joyous!  My one concession to the beauty myth is my skin trouble. It just ain't attractive to have zits, you know? And I've had tenacious acne for a long time, despite numerous dermatological treatments (even the infamous Acutaine, which no one should ever, ever,  ever  take unless they want six months of bloody noses, cracked lips, and people prying mercilessly into your sex life) with varying amounts of success. Since I currently don't have any form of health coverage, I am without access to a dermatologist and prescription treatments. My experience with the prescription acne drugs out there is that, much like echinacea and the missionary position, they are less effective with time.  Also, many of them are smelly and cause your skin to fry in the sun like an egg on the sidewalk. On a hot day. In July. In Arizona.  Thus, this lemon juice treatment is music to my ears; it's cheap, accessible, natural, and it works. It's also smoothing out my skin tone and lightening some of my imperfections. I am also a sucker for the smell of lemon, or citrus of any kind; I love me my Burt's Bees Lemon Cuticle Cream, grapefruit Hall's Vitamin C drops, and the Lauren Husting version of coffee, orange juice. What could be better than applying it lovingly to my face? A bath? Yes please. Actually, the magazine also suggests a lemon peel/juice bath...hmm...

       and...i'm spent   as in, I have spent all my money and am done with my Pay Homage to Capitalism shopping. Oops, I mean Christmas shopping. I only have one thing left to do, besides buy stocking presents (which does not come out of my pocket), which is make my mom a journal using the instructions for said product I found in the latest issue of  urlLink Bust .   For my father, I stumbled upon a great deal in the form of all three Myst computer games (enhanced special edition) at Target (Target, what haven't you done for me?) for $19.99. I am hoping this will provide him with some daytime entertainment other than reruns of  Murder, She Wrote  and  Perry Mason . If he doesn't use it, hell, I will. Can't go wrong with a good computer game.   Dad will also be receiving golf-related materials, such as balls and towels. Because this is the only thing that really pleases him.   For my mother, the  Two Towers  DVD. And the journal.   I did buy some stocking presents. For me, an Onion page a day desk calendar,  Princess Bride  DVD (again, only $10 at Target), and weekly planner which I have already started to use but will wrap anyway and acted surprised at upon "receiving." For my mom, a scented candle and Bob Seger CD. For my dad,  Mystic River  (the book). I need to get one more present for my mom and two for my dad. Relatively painless this year.   By the way, I am posting in hopes that my blog will show up again when I load it. It is not, currently, doing so; all I am getting is a white screen. It has made me notice how well those Google ads know me though, what with an advertisement for Thomas Edition horn mutes (much more applicable for Davis or Bethany) and at one point I remember seeing Bach brass instruments listed. Bach is making terrible horns right now, but whatever.

       today is a great day for contraception   Exciting news for women (and men)! Today a panel of the FDA  urlLink approved over-the-counter sales  of the morning after pill.   It's not final yet, but it's likely that the FDA will push it through to completion.   Good news, good news. The article I posted wasn't the same as what I read in the paper this morning, but it still raises some of the same issues. I continually find myself offended by the dialogue offered up by opponents of contraception, things along the lines of "would encourage irresponsible behavior" or "women would be confused as to how to use it."   1. Are we not already encouraging irresponsible behavior by funding abstinence-only sexual education in a culture that is highly sexualized?   2. Oh wait, you're right. Women are stupid. Time to start making babies!!!  Seriously though, maybe there are some women out there who would "abuse" (can it be abused? Are there side effects?) the pill. However, you have to ask, are they in a situation where they are highly sexually active but don't have health care and therefore have no access to regular birth control? Can't afford female condoms or a diaphragm? The condom broke? But if we're so afraid of morning-after pill abuse, why can't we make other forms of birth control more readily available? Why are we so concerned about someone else's reckless behavior? Is it more irresponsible to buy the contraception or to risk getting pregnant when one isn't ready?   Another argument against this form of birth control is that it can, in some cases, dislodge a fertilized egg from the womb. If you believe in life at conception, then this causes a problem. I struggle with this-of course all life is important, but who has the right to make the decision to keep or abort a fetus? The woman. She has to carry the baby for nine months, give birth through a normally pin-sized opening in her body, and deal with hormones, postpartum emotions, and the decision whether to raise the child (putting in countless hours and money) or find a family for adoption. Because our society doesn't place much pressure on men to be responsible for the babies they too help create, oftentimes it is only the woman making this decision. So life at conception for me doesn't take into account the rights of an already existing and thinking being.   I'm super happy that we've taken this step to encourage responsible birth control. I can only hope that we continue...provided opponents realize that you can't stop people from being sexual and what they do with their bodies is their own damn business.

       hey, jealousy   Lately I've had a visitor, the green-eyed monster himself. Now, in my efforts at self-improvement I try at all times to push back feelings of jealousy, as I feel they are the most trivial and harmful of emotions. However, lately I have been unable to deny that I am, indeed, jealous.   Of what, you may ask? Well, to put it most bluntly, of friends' lives going on without me, of people having fun without me. Fear of being forgotten gets tossed in there too. Shake well and serve in a frosted glass. Add olive for extra color.  I've been struggling with jealousy, to be perfectly honest, since summer, where I was mostly jealous that Jerry was having a good time being sought after by all the "cool" people. Meanwhile I was in top form, struggling to make friends and ending up with some great girls to lean on (fo rizzle), but still feeling like I wanted more. This I hate the most, the "I want more" feeling. Another topic for self-improvement: learning to appreciate what I have been given.   I'm jealous today because at times I feel like I have to fight to keep my place in Jerry's heart. I know this is not true, but jealousy makes me think this way. I start to think of all the things that are happening in Madison that I don't know about it. All the living and playing I could be doing there, but I am no longer a piece of the puzzle. I chose to move on, but did I really? I'm just as stranded here as I ever thought I was in Madison. Which I wasn't. I know I'm not making anyone jealous living out here, working at JC Penney and going to Borders for entertainment. If I had a cat, then maybe someone would be jealous. But why would I want someone else to feel that way? I don't. That's what jealousy does. He's a tricky one, that beast. Works in many ways.   I'm not really out to make a point; sometimes writing something out makes it better. Everyday I still get that sinking feeling in my stomach that I've destroyed everything I loved by moving away. I still want to move back. It's hard to make anything I do out here feel like it has any meaning. It's just an empty shell. No friendships. No adventures. Nothing I've learned anything from.   That's not true. You can learn something from any experience. I just think I've exhausted the possibilities.

       a misunderstanding   It seems to me that I am possessed of an unique ability to misunderstand or misinterpret many things that are often taken for granted by the rest of the populace. For example: The joke about men leaving the toilet seat up all the time flew over my head until I was 17 and someone explained it to me. Until then I couldn't understand what women were so upset about, thinking that the "seat" in question was the top part, the one that covers the toilet. I really didn't think it was a big deal.   Case in point: The saying "United we stand, divided we fall" is meant to mean that a group is stronger than its individual members, and derision and disagreement will cause failure. Makes sense, right? Well, to be perfectly honest I was always offended by this saying, thinking that it meant something along the lines of "We'll be a great team and knock out the competition, but if you screw up, well, don't expect us to come back and save your sorry ass, ya loser." We'd all stand up as a group but fall one by one.   When I think about the ways in which politics, business, and society work, sometimes I wonder if my interpretation is the correct one.

       things that have happened today so far   I drove Shawna up to LAX this morning, which was an adventure for me as I had never been there. It was pretty easy. I made super good time getting back-only an hour and a half! That's ridiculously good for LA, but probably the time of day had something to do with it. A radio station was playing Strauss's Don Juan, and then I FINALLY found KROQ. I always forget what channel it's on. 106.7. Must remember for future reference. I was momentarily sad when they played one of those little snippets with the famous person saying hi, and the famous person was Bradley Nowell. He died far too early, what beautiful music could he have made today? LA always makes me think of Sublime anyway, what with driving through Long Beach and all, and being naturally required to sing "I took that trip to Garden Grove" whenever I see the sign. Sigh.   I haven't got much to say about Hussien's capture, except that I agree with  urlLink Jerry  and  urlLink Margaret Cho . Y'all know I disagreed with us being in Iraq in the first place, but once we started it had to be played through. There's a lot of work to be done in Iraq and it needs to start now. There needs to be a plan for human rights as well as building contracts, and how dare the US exclude members of the United Nations from having a say? Oh wait, we're assholes. Okay, that makes more sense.   It's only a month until my recital. Eep! And I've been bad about practicing during Shawna's visit. I'm a mix of worry and anticipation: I'm scared stiff that I won't be good enough, having prepared almost entirely on my own and without feedback, but I can wait to travel and do the auditions and see the schools. February is going to be fun, or stressful, depending. I'm planning on being gone all month, driving out to my ASU audition Feb 6th and then flying to the Midwest for DePaul and UM, staying in Madison for as much time as possible, and flying up to McGill and going home from there. So it looks like this:  ASU Feb 6 DePaul Feb 14 or 28 UM Feb 13 or 20 McGill Feb 21-28   I'm stoked to go to Montreal. Although I would love to go to any of those schools, in my dreams I see myself rocking McGill, getting a full ride, and hanging out with Canadians and speaking French. Word.  If I plan to rock my auditions, then I must go and practice.

       new additions   I am proud to add Sheena the Tuba Playing Goddess to my links. Welcome Sheena! Best Blog Name Ever, by the way.   I will be pissed if this sore throat means I'm getting sick AGAIN. Pissed. And not drunk, either, although that is unfortunate.   Shawna and I just watched  Bend It Like Beckham . I love that movie--so very girl power and it makes me wish I had played soccer. I guess it's never to late to start, eh? I also wish I had an Irish boy-but I guess Jerry will do for now. That is the only thing that bothers me about the movie, though-the obligatory romance. Ah well, I'm not going to rant about it right now.   Last night we went out in La Jolla, but it was kind of dead so I called up Shaun and he invited us over to a party some UCSD kids were having. It was random, and from the random came enjoyable. They had a TON of alcohol. Amazing amounts of booze. Everything from Sake to Tanqueray. Wowza. I miss me my college parties.

       a quick update   Natatorium lifeguard buddy Shawna is visiting-she was studying abroad in Australia and is staying with me until her flight back to Wisconsin- so this is a quickie. Unfortunately it is raining, and that rules out about 95% of the Fun Things to do in San Diego.   Anyway, the cuban band has me confused. I think I just lost the gig-because they are going to Mexico City to play for two months. I think. Because Oddy's email english is hard to understand, I'm not sure what's going on. Besides that, I just got an email from the other trombonist wanting to practice. So either I'm wrong, and I'm supposed to go to TJ tonight, or they didn't get in touch with this poor guy. I'm so confused!   My recital is officially scheduled for January 14th. Hint hint!  Okay, time to get passport photos taken. Schmu.

       why, why do we hate ourselves?   Came across  urlLink this article  today. This is the kind of information that needs to get out there to people considering cosmetic surgery-doctors (real doctors) standing up and saying that something is potentially disabling. The article itself doesn't really pursue any health facts or drive this point home; instead it ends with what almost sounds like an endorsement for cosmetic surgery. I thought this was interesting:   "But advocates for the procedures say that critics simply do not understand the importance of high heels. "Some of these women invest more in their shoes than they do in the stock market," said Dr. Suzanne M. Levine, a New York City podiatrist who is widely quoted in women's magazines and has appeared on TV.  "Take your average woman and give her heels instead of flats, and she'll suddenly get whistles on the street," she said. "I do everything I can to get them back into their shoes.""  Those damn critics (doctors)! Looking out for their patients' health, for crying out loud! But they want to wear high heels so that men will whistle at them! Don't you understand that that's so much more important? That just made me laugh out loud. You get testimony from doctors who have to deal with screwed up cosmetic surgery, people being unable to walk, and they are called critics?   Mostly I am saddened by the societal attitude that says our bodies should change to fit our clothes. What sense does this make? Wouldn't it be easier to make a more orthopedic high heeled shoe? Or make comfort fashion? I know, I know, the beauty myth. A recent example: A week or two ago at Penney's a woman was trying on dress suits and found that the 9/10 she had picked out didn't quite fit. She was upset, naturally, concluding that she had gained weight and, sighing, would "just have to try on an 11/12" until she could lose a few pounds.   I wanted to point out several things to her: 1) the suit was from the Juniors department, which supposedly runs in sizes the same as misses. I am suspicious of this, and I imagine that they not only run smaller but also cater to a thinner, less busty frame. Not the frame of, as the case may be, an older developed woman. 2)Almost every time I go shopping, I bump up a size. After fretting about this for a while, I realized that I hadn't changed, the sizes had, getting smaller and smaller each new fashion season. Perhaps the problem here wasn't weight gain, but fabric loss. 3)There is no way of regulating women's sizes. Every brand measures and designs differently. What in the world does a "9" or a "14" signify, anyway? In men's sizes, pants generally go by waist circumference, no? I understand there's still some variance, but it seems like you would always know what size to go for. 4)I am preaching to the choir, I know, but may I point out the dissimilarity of women's bodies? The myriad of different shapes and sizes, hips, breasts, thighs, shoulders and waists that make up women?   My critique of the fashion industry could go on for ages, and it's only an example I use for my current point. What is this baffling trend to assume that designers know all and if it doesn't fit, it's our bodies' fault? I ask again, why do we hate ourselves so much? When will people understand that they have been brainwashed and milked for all they're worth? How many botched toe surgeries will it take?

       fighting off the christmas spirit with a stick   or Bjork, as the case may be. My mom is currently listening to Amy Grant's Christmas Album, which is the cheesiest of the cheesy. At least the cycled Christmas music they play at JCP contains a few gems by Ella Fitzgerald or the Canadian Brass. I can handle that, mostly because I feel like I haven't heard any good brass chamber music in a while...Brass Bash! This is the first time in four years I will not be participating in BB. I am now depressed. Blah.   Where do you stand on Christmas spirit? Do you hold on steadfastly to the joy of the season and look forward to buying and wrapping (and ultimately, getting) presents for the overall feeling of warmth it gives you to give of yourself? Or perhaps you associate Christmas with family and family with comfort and home. Perhaps you ignore the hustle and bustle and commercialism and celebrate Jesus' birth (although it was more likely in July-hey, the real Jesus and I could have the same birthday!) and what it means for your soul. [Editor's note: This incidentally is a recent topic on  urlLink We Have Brains , so I'm revising this entry to answer some of the questions posed there]  Or, if you are like me, you could care less, or feel weird about celebrating something you no longer believe in. Personally I like to get presents, but I feel cheap using Christmas as an excuse.   Let's explore the many ways I've come to this fallout on Christmas. For one, it's been a long time since I worshipped Jesus. Sometime in high school I got really into the God thing, prayed, went to church a lot, volunteered, was a moral person (To be fair, most of my prayers went like this: Oh dear Lord, please take away my bad acne problem and let that cute boy in history ask me out, because I am very lonely and do not have self-worth as a girl without a boyfriend. Oh, and I hope I do well on my Spanish test. Amen). I was also a Republican and made terrible jokes about Mexican immigrants. In other words, I was spoonfed most opinions and spiritual stuff by my parents. As much as I love my mom, she did give me a copy of that piece of trash  The Rules  and insisted I read Dr. Laura's books. I read  The Rules , by the time she suggested Dr Laura I was thinking enough on my own to refuse. My dad's choice criticism of Asian peoples was "DWO-Driving While Oriental" (many of you have perhaps your own personal favorite Ed Husting Racist Statement-that's mine).   That's a little taste of my high school years. Religious, Republican, and Racist. Dubya would have loved me. Thankfully I escaped, in two stages. Firstly in the form of apathy-that charming stage of teenagerhood where your parents are unbelievably uncool and anything they're interested in is old and stodgy, and boring. I declared politics and religion beneath me. God never really did address that acne problem, although granted I did get a boyfriend and usually did well on my Spanish tests. Secondly, I went to college. I went to liberal feminist atheist activist Mecca! Hurray! I took interested classes (I do believe that almost all of my classes choices were criticized by my father- "What are we sending you to school for?") like Russian lit and Buddhism, and Women's Studies. My friends were opinionated, just getting their debating wings and testing them out every chance they got, like me. Major Current Events happened. Lots of discussion. I began to be interested in what the world was really like.   I fell in love with Buddhism, and Christianity was spoiled for me. Spoiled in the form of the religious right, in the name of genocide and classism, racism and sexism. My esteemed and well-read friend Dan told me that many of Jesus' teachings were corrupted by the powerful, and we heard similar things in Women's Studies. The differences between Buddhism and Christianity struck me very strongly. I love the way Buddhism is not really a religion, or a following. The Buddha is not to be worshipped, he is to be emulated. He is the model, the proof that in every human being is ultimate attainment. There is no subjugation, no lessening of any being like in Christianity. Be humble, but not to a god, for your own enlightenment. It makes so much more sense to me. It rejoices so much more in the spirit, in the individual. I think Christianity could have been that way, but after Jesus left, things went back to the way they always were, but with a new justification. A new way of creating master and servant.   And of course, feminism. Feminism goes hand in hand with other ways of thinking; because it questions the necessity of class, sex, and race division inherent in patriarchy. Therefore it also questions capitalism, greed, globalization, nationalism, imperialism, consumerism, materialism (I am reminded of the wisdom of a certain Ferris Bueller:  "'Isms', in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an 'ism'. He should believe in himself.").   Okay, back to Christmas. Exploring all these facets of education has left me with little feeling about the season. I'm happy to be alive all the time. Christmas doesn't fill me with any previously lacking feelings of warmth and joy. I don't except to see a lot of family. As long as I can remember, my family holidays have consisted of my mom, my dad, Chipper, and me. No long lost relatives or huge family gatherings. So Christmas doesn't inspire me that way (before you go feeling sorry for me, consider that this doesn't really affect me all that much. If you've never had something, you don't miss it), nor do I celebrate for religious reasons. And I love to give people things, but I resent being forced. The spirit of giving moves me at odd times, and I usually act on it. If I see something neat in a store that reminds me of Jerry, I will probably get it. Or if I find something I no longer need, but someone else would appreciate, like the book I gave Davis for her birthday. I found that weeks before her actual birthday. If I hadn't found it, I probably wouldn't have sent her anything (no offense, dear, I still would have thought of you). I think gifts should have meaning and/or usefulness, not something you feel obligated to give.   Add to this the fact that this is seller's paradise. Here's where they can unload all those fancy expensive knick-knacks on someone desperate to find a gift for their second cousin's fiance. Such gift will be immediately stored and forgotten, or given away perhaps. The average person has little artistic skill to make something like a scarf or vase, so it's off to the stores, shopping the bargains, to buy one. I'm not totally knocking shopping; I appreciate gifts of music, books, clothes, or even gift certificates, because they are 1)useful and 2)thoughtful (unless the book is  Chicken Soup for the Recently Graduated Classical Trombonist's Soul -that's not thoughtful, that's lazy). Tell you what. If you don't know what to get me for Christmas, don't get me anything. Or take me out to dinner. I'd rather have the gift of your presence, and I will do the same for you. In fact, you can do that any old day of the year. Celebrate friends and family whenever you damn well feel like it, because why wait? Christmas comes but once a year and everyone, Jewish, atheist, and Buddhist alike, likes to get presents.

       adventures in culture shock   perhaps you are wondering at my appearance today on blogger, because you knew I was supposed to be in Tijuana for three days. Well I was in TJ, but only for about 12 hours.   I met Dayami, one of the singers, at our appointed one o'clock and we packed up and headed down to the border. In between we stopped at a beauty supply shop for Oddy, the congas player, because apparently he need glue to put his hair back on. I'm still very baffled. We were also distracted (I use the term "we" lightly) by a clothes boutique wherein Dayami bought two very short sassy little skirts for her and the other singer to dance in. Off to Mexico with us, loaded down with our beauty and couture purchases. Easy through the border, and I proceed to have no idea what is going on with traffic. Cars everywhere. Signs in Spanish. Okay we're at the hotel. I should have paid attention, but I was too confused. I will have to do this on my own next weekend.  Hotel. Across the street from where we will be playing. We scamper back and forth across the road a few times trying to find the rest of the band. Meet up with the other trombonist. Wander around some more. Find band in hotel room. HURRAY! Everyone is slugging back tequila, no limes or salt, or even ice, just tequila in a glass. I am very impressed. I am introduced to the band members present but understand very little, as everyone is speaking rapid Spanish. As far as I can tell only three speak English, Dayami included, and she later started speaking to me in Spanish because she wants me to learn and be a part of the band socially.   Later, we go back to the other hotel for a rehearsal, but what it amounts to is me and the other trombonist playing a couple of phrases from a song with the keyboard player. The rest of the band sits and watches. They mess around with tempo and register, basically put me through my paces. They ask me to play ridiculously high. I laugh. They say okay, nevermind. Then the band all gathers in a circle of chairs; I am ushered to sit down next to Dayami and Oneilio (the band leader) asks me what my position on the band is. I.e. what is up with this stuff I hear about you being gone in February and Canada and language barrier stuff. So I explain that in February I need to be excused from playing because I will be traveling to audition for schools. And in September I will be going to one of those schools, and that's the end of my chapter in the band. Anyway, they are very understanding and I am cleared for February departure. Then they ask if I'd be willing to possibly travel in Europe in March with them. Oh hell yeah, people, c'mon! I should have thought about this a bit more, but I agreed. I do have to consider bargaining for grad school money and accepting admission and all that. Also I'm not sure if I want to stay in SD until September. But whatever. We'll cross that bridge later.  Back at across-the-street-hotel, frenzied preparations by Dayami and Angeles (the other singer). I am informed that all that talk about how it's good to have another girl in the band means that I will be dressing similar to them. They match colors. Last night they did not by any means dress sluttily, but the skirts we bought..well I ain't wearing nothing like that.  Here's where I say, but I'm in the band, I was hired to play trombone, not jiggle! I am not a qualified jiggler! I'm not Jell-O! Because as much as these are two wonderful women, their presence in the band amounts to jiggling for the male gaze. You can get up on my ass about culture and Cuban style and all, but I still ain't doing it. The rest of the band dresses the same, the singers are glitzy. If I'm not a singer, I should be wearing what the band is wearing, or similar. Make sense? No jiggling! I refuse to jiggle!!  Well, I didn't play last night, I sat around and listened. I also racked my brain for useful Spanish. This is good-I imagine if I work my ass off at the language I will be pretty much fluent by May. I think it will be fun if I can get that together, but until then it will be pretty lonely. And my head will hurt. And I will attack anyone I hear speaking English and force them to talk to me. I will tie them down and rant and rant and rant. Ranty McRantypants.   Anyway, I came back with Daya today (she had to work) because I didn't want to sit around not speaking Spanish, not playing trombone, and not getting paid for another two days. Right now I am in the midst of a whirlwind of thoughts each prompting me to think very carefully about what I have agreed to and how this might affect my grad school plans. Which it won't, except if we go to Europe and I am unable to sign an admissions letter or something. Or negotiate about finances. Bloody hell.   I need to practice. And find a recital hall. And apply to DePaul and ASU. Shit. I miss school like crazy right now. I miss my little white bubble. That's right, I miss it! Wisconsin, you lovely white bubble you. You do not know Tijuana, and it does not know you. It's for the best, it really is. No panicking. Love the gig, love the opportunities. Peace.

       in which i use punctuation to the extreme   today was a fun day! i practiced lots! i cashed my beautiful check! i bought tofu! i coached preteenagers! i got my haircut! i considered dying it! i don't want to work tomorrow! i go to tj on thursday!   I am in a good mood. Things are moving, I'm somewhat busy, and I'm feeling more like my normal crazy wacky self. Questions i have: why does my high range elude me? why does my embouchure work one day and not the next? will i have to work while Shawna is visiting? what will happen if I call in sick? should I do it for both Wed and Sunday or just one? Do I care what JCP thinks? Will the band let me bring her with me over the weekend and stay for free? Should I dye my hair again? When are those library books due? Shit, do I have a fine? What CD should I buy for myself tonight?   That's my mind folks. It's working pretty fast right now. In fact it kept me from sleep for quite a while last night. I was angry with it, and gave it a stern talking-to, but to no avail. It just kept right on running, until I schooled it with a little Milan Kundera. If that doesn't make your brain wear out fast, I don't know what. Maybe a little War and Peace or something. Ugh. What a terribly boring novel.   I would just like to point out that only Jerry and Davis have commented on my blog. Please kindly share some love. i know that I am boring and often repeat myself. You may bitch at me if you wish. Please bitch respectfully though. It is easy enough, just click on the comment link and enter your info.   Spastic tonight, hmmm. Go go go is my brain. Wooooooooo. You might think that I am tripping, but I am not. This is not a mood I have felt in a while. I am happy because I have some money, I have a cool gig, Jerry might come to visit, Natalie is coming home in less than a month, and because I am super excited about grad school auditions. Montreal! Hurray!  Okay, I am done now. Will get in car and go to Borders, also get gas. I deserve a new CD. I am thinking.....BJORK!

       sudafed high! sudafed high!   The only thing that is even mildly enjoyable about having a bug is getting to take cold medicine and have that warm fuzzy feeling infuse your body and wrap you up in loving numbness. Non drowsy, my ass, I'd love to take this happiness right into bed with me and spoon it. Also I can't tell if I'm a fucking amazing trombone player or if I just no longer care whether or not I mess up. I'd like to think the former.   I am constantly amazed when I get money for playing or teaching music. Today I got a whopping $350 from Ramona High School for coaching. $35/hour. Jebus. So I go there for two hours and earn almost double what I earn working for Penney's for eight hours. Because I have a degree. Because I am special. Wowie. This weekend I will make $270 dollars for playing six hours. I'm in love. I know that doesn't sound like much in the long run, but I'm not out to make big bucks or anything. The point is that I have a skill, and people want it. That I can make a living doing something I enjoy. I'd like to refute the "starving musician" theory and say that if you have the drive, and seek out the gigs, you're golden.   Okay, I do think I really want that warm fuzzy nap. Warm fuzzy bed, here I come!

       thinking, via  urlLink we have brains    The collaborative topic for the week at WHB is:  What do you think keeps activist movements apart, both historically and today? Do you feel that movements need to work together, or are we all working on different things in different ways? And finally, how do you personally respond when other work you do seems to conflict with your feminist work?  A disclaimer, first off: I'm not any sort of scholar on the history of women's liberation, suffrage, black civil rights, or any such movement. Most of my information comes from memory, small snippets of history found in books, etc. So, if you feel my information is incorrect or if you would like to add something to my argument, please feel free.   This question came about from a discussion  urlLink Kerri  and  urlLink Lenee  initiated about the reasons the women's movement has not always appealed to women of color. In my understanding this came about first from the general climate of racism and inferiority present in past times, and second from pressures on individual groups not to band because they would lose support for the cause from other groups. The best and most relevant example is of course the ways in which women's suffrage used racist language to gain support from southern Democrats to win the vote before black men (where black women fit into this picture, is, as usual, nowhere). While the women's movement grew out of the great strides women made in abolitionist discourse and protests, once slavery was done away with the backlash began. Talk of giving the vote to black men enraged women campaigning for suffrage who felt their efforts and hard-won independence had been overlooked. Unfortunately, instead of using other reasoning to further their cause, many women turned to racist arguments. From what I recall of Angela Davis'  Women, Race, and Class , the argument was that white women as a whole are far more educated than the average black man, and therefore more qualified to get the vote and use it to white supremacist advantage.   I think you can use this example to explain how movements that might be stronger as a unit do not band together. The first wave of feminism was afraid to continue supporting civil rights for the freed slaves because it meant the men in power would take away their small gains. It's a case of backlash politics: the men who reigned supreme in Washington didn't want to see too many changes all at once, and two angry, oppressed groups together would represent more than enough social power to change the status quo. Thus, they worked hard to separate the two units and diminish their strength. This same "divide-and-conquer" tactic can be applied to the backlash against feminism in the 80's: a collective outpouring of false statistics, undermining media imagery, and political movements served to keep women apart and on edge, thus taking away the power the women's movement of the 70s had in collective energy.   In short, and more to the point, movements of social change are kept apart by other forces (read: "wealthy white men in powerful positions") afraid of the amount of change that might actually occur. Civil rights and the early women's movement were kept apart by suitors who had a political interest in seeing the other group fail; in pitting one group against the other they insured both would falter.   When coming into my own as a feminist, it was repeated to me over and over again that you cannot fight against one form of social oppression effectively without supporting all of them. In fact, I couldn't help but gain further understanding of racism, heterosexism, and sizism through feminism because I was beginning to grasp the language of oppression. They are all the same; you can replace nouns in one text on feminism with those from one on racism and the feel is identical. I rant equally on issues that effect all areas of civil rights, from feminism to gay rights to racism. I can't help it, one topic begets another. Therefore, I idealistically state that movements for social change must help one another out in order to make significant progress.   Realistically, is this possible? One of the things about feminism that works for me is that it applies to women of all ethnic and racial backgrounds. Gender inequality harms black women, lesbians, chicanas, transsexuals, poor women, rich women, pregnant women, plus-sized women, etc etc etc. Reading some of bell hook's work, I am aware of her frustration with black civil rights leaders who on some level feel racial equality is a man's world, or that it should come before women's equality. And I feel that this is a great detriment to the movement because it discounts the feelings and rights of half of the black population. So the question I have is: which should come first? Embracing a philosophy of equal rights from within, changing the black community to value women, or fighting against racism first and changing women's traditions after this has been accomplished?   Natalie wisely said the other day that the reason we must keep fighting for our rights is that to stop would mean everything would be lost. Now we are fighting just to stay in one place, just to keep the rights that we have. Thus I think that a movement, such as black civil rights, should embrace all issues of equality at the same time that it challenges social structures. On some level, change will be made. I'm using black civil rights as an example, but it could be applied to any group.   And finally, how do I react when I find myself doing work that conflicts with my feminist ideals? Well, I can't say I've done much of that (conflicting, that is), but in social situations I'm becoming better and better at analyzing the roles I play (in a conversation, for example, or as a musician) and making sure that my participation lines up with my feminist expectations. It's difficult to desocialize, but it can be done. I've learned to turn off the TV when it insults me, read literature that inspires me, and converse with people that stimulate me. It's a fair trade, I'd say. And I'm coming closer and close to aligning my political viewpoints on all issues that effect our country today because of it.

       i have a question   and if you know the answer please enlighten me.   Where are we getting all this  urlLink money?   Lately I can't even complain about Bush and this administration; it just wears me out. So all I have to say to this is:  ARRRRRGH *tearing hair*  The part that bothers me is not so much the money (although all I ever hear from Bush is spend this, spend that when I can't imagine  he's  ever had to worry about money) but how little sense all this war stuff makes to me. So, there's no WMD in Iraq, and still they make a big deal about it. I thought all this talk about the war on terror was supposed to make the world safer. *snort* So why do we keep spending so much on military weapons and defense systems? Shouldn't we also be setting an example?  Or wait, is that too idealistic of me? Am I just a silly hippy? Silly hippy, peace is for rich people.

       things of minor interest   Currently reading:   Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women , Susan Faludi   Killing Rage , bell hooks  Currently en route to my eagerly awaiting hands:  Cunt: A Declaration of Independence , Igna Muscio  Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism, and the Future , Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgarnder  Spend the day with Natalie, chatting and attending two of her very interesting classes. The first, a class on discourse (forgive me, Nat, I'm not sure of the title), was pretty intense. I'm not sure if I could effectively regurgitate any of the information, so I'll just wait until it sinks in a little. I greatly enjoyed the other class, Gender and Reproductive Rights in the Law, for lots of reasons. The professor was awesome. So funny, so foul-mouthed, so wonderful. The class was entirely women, I believe, and it created an air of relaxation and enjoyment that, no offence guys, having men around sometimes dislocates. The cases we discussed were extremely aggravating in the ways they displayed that the law is behind the times (in the case of  urlLink Alison D , a lesbian who helped raise a child her lover had birthed) and also sexist in the ways it upholds gender stereotypes for both men and women as fathers and mothers.  Extremely interesting. Lately haven't felt too much like blogging but I assure I still think of you often, dear Buddha Stew fans. ;) Right now, it's time for Futurama.

       and he might get re-elected?   Via  urlLink Echidne  here is a funny poem of our President's (all actual quotes):   Make the Pie Higher  I think we all agree, the past is over. This is still a dangerous world. It's a world of madmen And uncertainty And potential mental losses.  Rarely is the question asked Is our children learning? Will the highways of the internet Become more few? How many hands have I shaked?  They misunderestimate me. I am a pitbull on the pantleg of opportunity. I know that the human being and the fish Can coexist.  Families is where our nation finds hope Where our wings take dream. Put food on your family! Knock down the tollbooth! Vulcanize society! Make the pie higher! Make the pie higher!  I think we can all agree that he makes a great existentialist poet, but maybe not so much a president.

       side effects of moon-induced enlightenment may include...   -popping grapes like a decadent roman empress -designing a tattoo for placement on right hip -wanting to clubbing with reckless abandon -unabashed desires to make out with women -thoughts of storming Washington DC and talking sense into people -willingness to educate and similarly enlighten all other women  Because that's what I'm calling this. Enlightenment. Empowerment. And enlightenment, as we should all know from our Buddhism classes (what's that you say? You've never taken a Buddhism class? Sacrilege!), is not the attainment of nirvana but rather buddhahood, in turn supplying our knowledge to the rest of the world through great compassion.   Not that I'm claiming to be any sort of guru. I think I'll stick with good ol' empowered woman. Still, I feel I could do some edumacating around hyeah. Live a little.   Because I really do feel alive. Like I've never really felt before. Is this happiness? Maybe so. But it's also antsiness and I'd like to do me some activism. Word.

       life is so goddam beautiful, i can't stop crying   Oh my goodness. What a wonderful, marvelous, beautiful, soulful, intense, hilarious, moon-given moment I just had. I have to write it down before the feeling fades (although right now it might never!) and here I am. I want to share it with you. I want you to know the power of me.    Cunt  is such a book. Such a book and a force to be reckoned with. If you have a cunt, you have to read it. I will give it to you for your birthday! Or on your next period. I will! You have to have it. I wish I had it. I have to go to Borders and read it there because I am dirt poor and need to be able to afford plane tickets to Montreal. But I might just get it anyway, because it makes the power of me, the power of woman so wonderful I just can't stop the feeling that hot lava is coursing through my veins and if you asked me to I could change the world with one blink of an eye.   You know me. You know I want women to be equal, recognized, signature human beings. You know I would fight for the death to see things changed around here. Maybe you don't know, but I just went off the pill, and I just had my first non-pill period, my first REAL LIVE WONDERFUL menstration in almost four years. Because you don't really have a period on the pill. You have a fake one. That a pill tells you to have. And that's crap. You should know that it's crap to the fullest extent. Because why would you dislike or abuse something that is natural and becoming and perfect just for womenfolk? Why would you let society tell you it's bad and painful and dirty and you should cover it up or not have it (because when I see those ads for birth control that will skip your period for four months, I feel sick, like that would be the worst thing that could ever happen to me. Not have my period?!?! But it makes me a woman! It makes me a force to be reckoned with. It makes my day, honestly. I love it.) ??!?? Why? Love your body, love the goddess you are. You can make life or take it away. Men can only take it away. You've got twice the power, twice the love. Use it!!  So I'm going off because there's so much energy and it's channeling into my fingers and I can't keep to the point, but why should there be a point? I feel great goddess buddha-inspired wonderful and nothing can ever stop me now. I was reading the chapter of  Cunt  about learning about the moon, and how it affects you and your cycle, and on and on. I left the store, and I got in my car, and I drove home. I was going up the hill to my neighborhood when the moon peaked out above the crest. It's smiling! The moon is smiling right now, go outside and look, it's smiling and it's smiling at YOU and ME because things are in your hands, the world is ripe for change and who is going to do it? YOU and ME.  The moon was smiling at me because it knows I'm bleeding and it's happy for me. We can share this beautiful moment where life is renewed again and again through me. I laughed out loud! I laughed so hard and I said "I love you too, moon!" And I laughed and laughed and giggled and chuckled with tears streaming down my face until my stomach hurt but I still laughed and loved the moon and I love myself and it's all up to me. Everything. Everything changes this day forth. I am a full person now. I understand my wonderful, beautiful body and I worship it and it worships me in return. We can do wonders together. We are one, finally.   You may think I'm crazy but what do I care! You don't feel as good as I do, unless you do because you recognize the power of you and you are crying with me because of the truth that I speak. I am crazy. And I am a genius and a lover and an artist all in my own soul. I am me and that is what I will always be. No one can stop me. No one can stop you, either, and let's be goddess and gods together. Let's make something happen. Now.  The moon and I, we're best friends. We laugh at each other and love each other and I dedicate this day, January 26th, to my new and dearest friend Moon. May we have many more beautiful moments together. I wish you the same forever and ever and ever and ever.

       tired old chops!   I just ran my audition program, minus excerpts. I did work on some little spots that were rough, but mostly I was just doing it to see if I could. See if I have stamina for this concert tour I'm doing next month. :)   I made it. I couldn't play the high Cs in the Stevens Sonata but I didn't get the low note crap or crazy fracking issue due to fatigue. I feel good. I have earned chai!   Therefore, I am off to Borders to get chai and read some more of  Cunt  by Igna Muscio. Yay, vulvas!  I hope everyone had a super Monday. How was your Monday? Did you make a new friend? Have a good lunch? Was the weather nice or crappy. Let me how your day was, I'd love to know. Mine, it was good. I coached at Ramona, and taught the freshman to double tongue. I impressed them with how fast I could do it, and it made them respect me a little more which was definitely called for. The tuba player, David, and I woodshedded scales because of his difficultly associating fingerings with notes. A minor problem. :) It was good though, and I was hard on him. I'm learning tuba fingerings fast and I like it. Now to get my hands on a tuba... Also, it was a nice day and I ate a tuna sandwich. Hurray!  Peace and love to all y'all.

And most of them this past summer. Should I could Blue Lake as living in Michigan? It certainly was an experience. Meijer and the stupid U-turn dealies and all.   Also for your amusement:  urlLink 100 things  to do with your boyfriend or girlfriend instead of "it." Stolen from  urlLink Green Fairy , who stole it from someone else.   My favorites:  26. Look up all the synonyms for "love" 32. Visit a Japanese restaurant and do karaoke (that's not blatant stereotyping right there, is it?) 45. Have a burping contest 48. Head to Wal-mart to try on shoes-in styles you'll never buy (when I think romance,  I think Wal-mart and shoes. Nothing gets me dripping like Wal-mart. Oooh. I get it.) 64. Watch a scary old horror movie. (because the teens having sex are always the ones that get killed)  Part of me feels this list could be used as a crackerjack way to build counseling teams at summer camps across the nation. I mean, it builds so much group spirit and cooperation! Putting things together without looking at the directions! Walkie-talkies and secret missions! Huzzah! I love camp.

       practicize! lift that lower jaw! lower it! lift! exhale!   While practicing today, I thought it might be a good idea to compile all of the stuff I've learned/been taught/discovered in this particular stage of my musical career.   *warning! Extremely boring for non-musicians. Proceed with caution*  I've discussed aspects of this with some people, but the big challenge for my trombone playing during my year-off (of what? private lessons I guess) has been the crazy noises coming out my horn when I wanted the noises to be less crazy and more like solid, perfect, beautiful notes. Preferably the note I intended it be, but I'll take any note over *bzzzzfartwhzzzzplop* (if you're curious, that sound has indeed from my bell and it was not pretty). Any sort of "zzzz" sound, I feel, is not recommended for classical audition training.  To combat this problem I have been doing a fair amount of reading (mostly on the  urlLink Online Trombone Journal , an excellent reference and a good way to get advice from all ages and levels of trombonist), practicing with different embouchure and breathing techniques, trying vainly to get Sean to meet with me and listen, and buying stuff. With t-minus two weeks to my first audition (ASU), things are finally starting to fall into place. My new-found love of practice and improvement has helped, but I'd like to give props to a few things I feel are doing me the most amount of good. I think that some of these are instrument-transferable; thus I hope I can lend a hand to any musician who wants some advice.   1.  Breathe, breathe, breathe.  For a long time this winter when I was struggling with weird noise issues, I was also sniffly and in between colds. I've always recognized the importance of breath control, but how easy it is to forget when you're sick! Post-sick, I still wasn't breathing, and I couldn't understand why playing still made me feel woozy like a Chris McGann 21st birthday.  I started doing some exercises (my favorite: breathe in 8, hold 8, out 8, hold 8, increase value until room spins) and dusted off my BERP, Voldyne, and the ever popularly phallic Breathe-right. Presto! Not only did I feel less dizzy, some of my embouchure issues righted themselves.  2.   Posture.  I get nailed for this all the time, but it took Chris Houlding to drive it home and have it make sense for me. People are always telling me, stop moving so much, it's distracting, you're not making any more music, etc., but it was Chris saying how on top of all of this, excessive movement is hard on the chops and just wears out your muscles faster. Thus, more frack, more weird noises, less music.   Well, why didn't they say so before?  I'm like the crazy Mullins lady: if you want me to fix your apartment, tell me there's a water leak damaging the house foundations. Except substitute "fix my cracked notes" for "fix your apartment" and "tell me I'm making cracked notes worse by moving around a lot" for "tell me there's a water leak damaging the house foundations." So, I keep still and hold my horn comfortably in front of me, like Mark Fisher told me to (now he'll like me better at my DePaul audition :).  3.  Open your throat.  With posture and breathing fixed, those crackly low weird not-notes were rare, but not non-existent. Chris helped me with this as well. With my tight neck and throat, I was unable to play lower notes. Singing as low as I could and thinking "o" is a tremendous improvement over *bzzzfartwhzzzplop*. In fact, using it for every register has expanded my high range as well, helping me relax and not tense up for Bolero. Ugh. *moment of distaste for bolero*  4.  Get a mini-disc player.  Or something! Jerry was kind enough to give me his minidisc, and I purchased a mic. I have a tape recorder, but damn it sounds like ass, and it's not you, I promise. The minidisc, while sounding better and helping you to identify all aspects of playing up for improvement, is also extremely fun to play with. Also, you can make CDs from it and do all sorts of fun stuff (I have yet to get the proper programming, but someday, my son, someday...). The other night I went through my Ralph Sauer excerpts tape (highly recommended for trombonists), listened carefully, practiced, and then recorded the same excerpts. I learned a ton about my playing, and I wasn't freaked out like I thought I would be. There's a lot of work to do, but it's at least doable.   5.  The tuning CD.  Lauren-tested, Buddha-approved. I found a free, legal one for download  urlLink here . One of the things my minidisc told me to fix was intonation. Fine tune it. For the most part my intonation is good but as a graduate student, I want to rock the trombone without having to worry about intonation. I got other shit to learn, yo. Each track on the CD is a note droned for two minutes or so, and you can repeat the track indefinitely listening for beats, tuning other pitches to the note, etc. Basically do whatever you want. Already I can hear some major differences in my intonation, and from better intonation comes better tone and clearer sound quality.  If you don't have burning capabilities, or just can't figure it out, let me know and I'll burn you a copy. Spread the intonation goodness!   6.  The finger position mentality.  For trombonists, because we are stupid and forget these things while the rest of you with keys are like, yeah, duh?!?! While  urlLink reading  up on tuning CDs, I found the following advice:  "you've got to hold the slide with your fingertips." why? because: "The nerve-rich finger tips are closely connected with the brain and therefore the ear." He goes on to say that Joe Alessi will get you on this, if you're not holding the slide correctly. Audience members can clearly hear how intonation slips when the player gets lazy and changes grip.  Hey, if my hero Joe Alessi says so, I'll do it. So I'm working on remembering that aspect of posture along with the others. When working with the tuning CD, it's really apparent how much it helps.   I'm pretty jazzed about all my new toys, techniques, and advice. Worrying about grad school auditions has been driving me up the wall; not knowing what to expect and not having anyone to help me out is Stress City. The minidisc player has taught me I can just as effectively be my own feedback, and the more I experiment, the more I feel not just like a better player, but a full-fledged trombonist as well.   After saying all this I'll probably come back next week and tell you I've chucked my horn out the window. Just another week in the life of a musician.

       because choice is on my mind...    urlLink Here's  another article for you to peruse on the subject of birth control.   I would especially like to hear from the men in the audience. Would you consider taking birth control? If so, would you prefer the hormonal kind, which the majority of women taking birth control use, or this RISUG injection that will offer up few side effects, no loss of libido, and is somewhat long-term?  I think this RISUG sounds like great news, and I'm terribly saddened to hear that it won't likely turn up in the US. Anyone who says capitalist corporations don't control our choices is a damn fool.   I, for one, would like to see this because I know hormones aren't a great choice. They work fine, and are reliable, but how often when I was on BC did I feel a little weird about putting extra crap into my body? Long term effects? Loss of libido? Not to mention that I like to feel in touch with my body and knowing to the day when my period was going to come was always a little disappointing. Call me crazy, but it's kind of fun. Annoying, sometimes, waiting around until one day it unceremoniously stains your panties, but still fun. I'm just one woman, and we all have different experiences with cramping, spotting, and whatnot. I recommend you all read the first few chapters of  Cunt  by Igna Muscio, if not the whole thing (as someday I plan to do, when I can afford to buy it or find it at the library), on getting in touch with your cycle. *insert touching woman power moment here*  Anyway, back to my original slant. If men can escape the hormones for something better, then perhaps they can help woman do it as well. I resented the one urologist's comment "I think what we've already got works pretty good" because shouldn't medicine continually explore new and better options even if there's a "longer track record" studying an existing treatment? Call me idealist, but there's probably something better.   link via  urlLink Bloggers for Choice

       more frustrations   I never have this house to myself. If I wake up at 9:30 (which almost always means I won't get out of bed until 10:11) I only have an hour until my dad comes home from golf. He immediately sits down and begins watching Murder, She Wrote. Yesterday he was watching MSW until 5:30. I had no idea that show was in so much demand! It's friggin' ridiculous. I don't care if he's doing other things, like the crossword, at the same time; he's still watching TV all the damn day.   If you've lived with me, you know how much at stressful times I desire almost complete silence. The sounds of TV or music aggravate me beyond belief when I want to escape into myself and figure things out. You can be home, fool, but don't you dare interrupt my thoughts.   In a roomate situation, that's fixable. I can negotiate times of day I want silence and be understanding of times people want music or tv. This is not a roomate situation. My 'roomates' are a crabby, thinks-i-owe-him-constant-love-and-affection-in-repayment-for-tuition-and-clothing wino with a bad back and a penchant for the most inane tv shows imaginable (The Match Game, anyone?), and my dear sweet mother who just wants to know how my day was (and it is as it always is: a combination of practicing, sitting, blogging, mmmmaybe running some errands...) but can be awfully invasive about it. Me, I'm the other crabby roomate but I can be pleasant in a you-scratch-my-back-i'll-scratch-yours kind of way. I.e. turn off the damn tv until  at least  five pm please! There's nothing good on tv at 10:30 am! It's all stupid movies and bad anime cartoons and tv shows "designed" with stay-at-home wives in mind. Ala Murder, She Wrote. (although, props to smart chicks)  I'm going to die here. Not physically. Little pieces of my good humor and patience are going to slough off and fall away, and I'll never be able to regain them.  I'll be a pissy old woman when I'm thirty. And Angela Lansbury's theme song will always be stuck in my head.

       the frustrations of rancho bernardo are upon me   Curse you, suburbia.  Where are your coffee houses, your indie record stores, your neighborhood bars?  Who keeps destroying the beauty of our hills by building cookie-cutter houses on top of them?  When will I greet my neighbor cordially? When will I next see my neighbor?  Why must everything be just ever so much beyond walking distance?  What cost, safe and affordable family living?   Just a few reasons why I miss dear old urban Madison- Expresso, Pinkus, Exclusive company, Hawks, A Room of One's Own, the boys upstairs, James Madison park, easy use of the busline, not having to worry about hills because of the lack thereof...  I'm an urban girl, ultimately. Living in Madison always felt free, easy, moderately inexpensive (when you know where to go), so very delectably independent. Of course, that's because I didn't have a car, shared apartments, borrowed furniture, and lived 2000 miles from my parents. Who paid my rent. *ahem* Not to say that there weren't inconveniences, but even they seem ever so sweet. It's Madison I miss, but I would settle for anywhere urban...just to get me out of this hellhole they call suburbia.   Curse you, suburbia.   Here in RB I feel like a rat in a cage (ala Smashing Pumpkins). Not to slight the parents, but they just never really let you grow up, do they? And I'm so sick of driving. I would give anything to just walk to the convenience store. Meet some friends for coffee. I want to be able to go out without worrying about having a DD. Everyone should stumble home drunk! No child left behind!   Will I grow out of this urban mentality? When I grow up and have a family? (I shudder to think) Whatever. Right now I know that I'm not ready for suburbia yet. I'm not settled by any means. I want hodge-podge furniture I found on the street and upstairs neighbors having loud sex. Parties of wild abandon. Lateness caused by misreading the bus schedule. Gigs.   I repeat:   Curse you, suburbia.

       curiosity caused the cat to waste some more time   although it was quite informative. If you're looking for an easy answer regarding the next presidential election/democratic nomination, take this  urlLink quiz  courtesy of  urlLink Echidne of the Snakes .   My results:  Kuchinich 100%  Sharpton 90% Kerry 89% Clark 84% Dean 82% Edwards 79% Lieberman 77% and last and certainly least,  Bush 8%  First off let me admit to a certain ignorance regarding finances/economic issues- I can't say that fixing our budget matters to me as much as fixing social issues. So it may be that there is a wider gap amongst these candidates when you actually answer the economic questions instead of going "huh?" and putting down no opinion.   So, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed about this whole "understanding where everyone stands on the issues" dealie. Armed with my new socio-political awareness, I'm prepared to take on women's issues head on! But when I think about having to slog through all this campaign jargon and make an educated choice...ugh, I just get tired. In other words, I feel that I should make a better effort to know what's going on politically in order to best make a decision regarding the issues that are important to me, but I still hate hate *hate* (HATE) politics. Grr. I'd rather rally. Or do some grrl power stuff. Sadly I'm torn between going all out and burning my bra, and making informed, educated, and well-researched actions based on politcal consciousness.   It's really tearing me apart here. *sob* Excuse me, I need some time alone...  As Lauren walks away, she puts her arm around Kuchinich's shoulder and says: "So, Dennis old boy, this political quiz thingie I found on the internet told me I should like you. Being as I don't feel like doing the research myself, why don't you just go ahead and tell me what I want to hear..."  They walk off into the sunset, talking animatedly. Sweet violins sing and fade in time with the darkening screen. Roll credits.

       the historic debate: lauren vs. mom on gay marriage   I watched a little bit of  urlLink Monkey Face's  (ahem, I mean, Bush) address tonight and was aggravated again by his stances on abstinence and same-sex marriage. Of course. Who in their right mind isn't? But I brought this up with my mom, and we promptly got into a discourse (ie, rather heated argument) about gay marriage.   It makes me shake to think that such a thing as a definition of marriage as man and woman would be put in the Constitution.  In the bleedin' Constitution . It's just so fundamentally...wrong. My mom, however, interprets it not as denying rights to gays, but creating something that straight marriage advocates can keep to themselves. She argues that marriage is traditionally between a man and a woman, and therefore we should keep it that way. Give same-sex couples all the same rights and benefits, but call it something else. Marriage is for straight people, she says.   What?  First off, traditions change. "What's wrong with tradition?" she asks me. Well, tradition's all fine and good yo,  except when it excludes someone from a civil right.  Keep your traditions, but adjust them to the times. Make them fair and reasonable, please.   Secondly, how much does this smack of "separate but equal" to anyone else? Okay, so we've got equal rights on both sides, but only straight people can get "married" and gays "something elsed"? So my mom is married to a man. How is that marriage weakened, harmed, or even embarrassed by a man being married to another man? I don't think it's possible. It's just a word. A definition. Your own marriage should be what you make of it, not what other people are also participating in it.  But most of all, I am just absolutely baffled by her tenacity and stubbornness to retain this concept of "marriage" for straight couples. Despite my best reasons (but you create two different classes of citizens! tradition can't always stay the same! why does it matter?), I could not convince her. Marriage is to be specifically for a man and a woman. It's an aspect of the same-sex marriage debate that I can't say I've ever heard before, and it is quite the brick wall.   I was also interested (and somewhat amused) to hear that she thinks most people aren't homophobic. I wonder about that woman. She needs to see some more of the world. Just because we have  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy  doesn't mean we're post-homophobia. In the same ways we are by no means post-feminism or post-racism, we cannot claim that discrimination is a thing of the past.

       hans! hans has a blog!   Or a livejournal, but whatever. Beware, it is very blue. You are warned -I will not be held responsible for impending eye injuries.  This is particularily exciting for me, as I am a great admirer of Hans' body of work (most of which has been sent to me via email with the admonishment "please don't hate me forever and boycott all my future plays if it's bad" attached to it) and he is the creme-de-la-creme of witty. For those of you who don't know, Hans and I have been AIM buddies for...ooh goodness, five years? Since I broke up with Dave, maybe (a historic moment here: that's probably the first time I've used my breakup with Dave as a marker). We met when we were young and fantastically obsessed with the musical Les Miserables. We went through a brief period of flirt, to be replaced by an awkward understanding of each other's psyches.    Thankfully, we are no longer fantastically obsessed with Les Miz, but I can say that we are still young. These days I sincerely look forward to my chats with Hans, because I know I will a)laugh, b)discuss juicy romantic events, or c)have all of my value systems and fragile knowledge of politics shattered into nothingness. Also, when talking to Hans I find myself rapidly exhausting my vocabulary list of big words like "fantastically" and "admonishment."  Do Hans and I have plans to meet in the future? Who knows: perhaps someday I will write the score for his musical, or edit his first novel. And we will dance ribbon-clad in a field of blue daisies. Amen.

       lauren decides she loves this vegetarian thing   (and not a word about the orange chicken, jerry).  I love if it only that it means I have discovered  urlLink Henry's  and its excellent quality, cheap, old-timey organic goodness. I think I could work it where I only shopped there, getting away from all the crappy processed crapety crap going down in the major chains. Screw conviences. I've got all the time in the world to cook. I made veggie curry tonight. And Henry's helped me. Six different kinds of vegetables for ten bucks? I think I can handle that. Oh, and I can get some wholesome cereal too? Okay. Apples are a dollar a pound? Well, sign me up. Is that basmati rice I see there? Why yes, it is, why don't you take some? Don't mind if I do.   And...I'm officially in love with a food market.   Natalie informed me the other night that in France, it's illegal to use any kind of preservative, hormone, or genetic engineering on food. Therefore, she said, despite eating a lot of "unhealthy" foods, she lost weight. I've been thinking about this and in lieu of my love of Henry's, am going to do my best to watch what kind of crap I am putting in my mouth. Already I've been cooking more and experimenting with the leftovers, and I can claim I feel healthier (how much of that is just psychological is up to you, but I can't knock that either). When I get a kitchen of my own I'm going to take the time to stock up and get the essentials that form the basis of most of my recipes, and only have to do shopping for vegetables and other perishables.   Hehe. I already have this silly vision of me, in my kitchen be-aproned with spatula, dancing around to some techno music and creating glorious piping hot vegetarian dishes. And I will have a cat. And it will go, "meow?" and eat my mushrooms, for which it will receive a smack on the bottom and a "silly cat!" Ah yes. I can see it now.   On another note, like so many blogs of note, I have decided to do a "What I'm Listening To" list in my sidebar. I HIGHLY recommend that Beth Orton album. I'm jamming to it now, and it's fantastic. Schmu-licious.

       popcorn teeth   I love popcorn and all, but I always have to floss after I eat it. Since the braces trauma of high school (nothing like being the loser whose senior picture is a flash of metalmouth), I've been pretty obsessive about keeping my teeth clean. Plus, playing trombone with gritty teeth is just no fun. Popcorn shell stuck in my molars is like water torture to me. I find myself constantly straining my tongue to reach those wedged skins and ending up doing nothing but shoving them farther back into the recesses of teeth. Lord. Therefore, this time I have immediately gone for the floss, to prevent tongue soreness.   I slept late today after a relaxing night with Natalie-we watched  urlLink  Lovely and Amazing  , which was quite good, funny, depressing, and heart-warming all at the same time. We got a kick out of how Jake Gyllenhaal seems to be the indie films version of Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate-playing all these jail bait roles. And Catherine Keener shows up again as her usual self. All in all, a good movie.   My goal for the next two weeks is to practice at least 3 hours a day, more if possible, and I will rigidly make sure I do this. I was practicing a lot before, but I think only for short periods and the result is that my stamina is lacking. So three hour sessions or two hour and a half sessions a day is my resolution. And, as usual, that's what I should be doing instead of blogging. Adieu, mon beau ami.

       i'm bumming   I don't feel like doing much of anything today, although it's not like I have that much to do anyway. I should do laundry, and clean my room. But I'm clinging to the little bits of Jerry's presence that are still there: the marks on the carpet where his suitcase was, the smell of his shampoo on the pillow, the memory of being held while watching tv. I could practice. I need to exercise. There are plans on the table to hang with Natalie tonight. So far all I've been able to do is curl up and read Pam Ribon's book,  Why Girls Are Weird , which is very good and I had a hard time pulling myself away to write this entry. It's a Catch-22, you want to keep reading, but the book inspires you to do your own web journalling.   I've long since realized the folly of wishing I had done things differently this year. Although I could techically go back to Madison, what I really want is to never have left at all. Of course that's impossible. Right now I'm wishing like that again though. Because the time I spend with Jerry is so happy, so carefree...and then it ends? That's not the way...nonono. I hate seeing him on a timeline, I wish that we could live in different apartments in the same town and see each other lots and often, but send each other home when we were annoyed or tired. A week's visit makes me feel like I have to always enjoy myself. Not to say that we are often annoyed-it happens quite seldom in our mutual company-but the small moments where it does happen make me sad beyond belief because I can cure them with private time. I'm worried about the worst-when (what if I don't?) will I see him again? Will we always be happy together like this?   I don't want anyone to be worried about me, by now I've got this kind of depression down to a pat science. I deal. I just have to be careful about wishful thinking.   On a non-related side note, and to proove that I'm not totally curled up in a mental fetal position stuffing Ho-hos into my mouth and mumbling about cat people, can anyone think of a reason why my microwave burrito tastes and smells like it's been soaked in champagne?

       ode to jerry   First off, comments are back up, thanks to Haloscan. So, Jerry, you can get free commenting from them if you like.  Second...Jerry's flight is leaving as I type! *tear* We had a great time, and already I feel lonely and sad. But no matter, it's only a month til we meet again. I get to go back to my pathetic existence of practicing, coaching, and sitting around getting chubby. Yee-haw. While I can't wait to see him again, for my own sake I hope it feels like plenty of time to get my audition stuff together for real.   Sigh.

       happiness is...   It is the middle of my week with Jerry, and I will be sad for it to end! But I feel that in recent weeks I have managed to put things in perspective (finally) and can deal. Plus, only a month and I'll be in Madison again. So yippee.  Went to see Chris Houlding's recital tonight. Chris teaches at the  urlLink Royal Northern College  in Manchester, England, and he is a fantastic trombonist. His performance was truly virtuosic, and I look forward to playing for him tomorrow night and getting a feel for his teaching style. Sean has encouraged me to talk to him about study at the RNCM, so I plan on discussing that with Chris as well. Plus, Manchester! What I want to do is pull a Griffin and just get offered grad school to me on a silver platter. What's that you say? I'm not Griffin? Ah well, a girl can dream, can't she?   Tomorrow for some sun and swimming as well. I am feeling fat and sassy lately, and have need to get some exercise.  One last thing- my comments have disappeared. Boo. This is because BlogSpeak has apparently lost its domain or server or some such. Grr.

       i'm wasting time   ...until it's a reasonable time to leave and pick up Jerry at the airport. I should be practicing, but I'm too excited. Does that make sense? I guess it's a focus issue.   For fun I attempted to convert my handwriting into a font at  urlLink Fontifier . I printed out the template, wrote in all my characters, and scanned it back into my computer. Unfortunately I am having trouble getting my computer to save it as a .gif file, which is what they want. Grr! I will go back later and try to figure it out. How cool is that though? You could have your very own font. My handwriting is pretty plain yogurt, but I could see someone like Dan Breilmeier having an awesome font. If you could read it. Good luck there.   I'd like to try to be a little bit more web tech savvy. I took part of an html tutorial and have a basic idea of how to implement colors, fonts, tables, etc., but I'm looking into getting my own domain and I'd like to be able to make the best of it. Have a really cool, well-designed site, like. Whereupon I will be well-recognized by the weblog community not only for my brash and insightful opinions but also my flashy banners as well. Huzzah.  (I have a design for a trendier Buddha Stew simmering around in my head, but what to do?)  Okay, I'm just killing myself with anticipation. The best thing for wasting time: attempting to understand where I am in Riven and figure out all the damn codes and signals so I can beat its mo'fucking ass. Yee-ah.

       experimentation   I've put all my blog links on  urlLink Blogrolling  so now you will be able to see when they are updated, and I can add blogs with more ease. The rest are reorganized and some have been added. I'm tired of writing a href=blah blah blah over and over.   Please note the additions of Feministe, Squishy, Some Grrrls, and Margaret Cho. These are sites I read fairly frequently and have only recently linked. They are awesome, enjoy!

       a link, a button, and a rambling    urlLink Hilarious . Pamela Ribon is famous for her online journal, also she's written a book,  Why Girls Are Weird , and screenplays and helped donate hundreds of books to the Oakland Public Libraries. She's also fuckin' hilarious. I laughed all the way through this entry. Enjoy, as a gift from me to you.   The button at your left is the US's current terror alert status. I'm freaking out man.   Speaking of terrorism, what do all y'all think of  urlLink fingerprinting  of foreigners visiting our country?   I'm not against it. Desperate times...well, at any rate, I think it's fine as long as it is used rationally and equally. I am a little disturbed by this:      "The only exceptions will be visitors from 27 countries; mostly European nations;    whose citizens are allowed to come to the United States for up to 90 days without visas."  Hm, I personally think if we're going to put our spines up and distrust people, we should do it across the board, eh? Ah well, I'm not sure how much safer a fingerprint and a photo will make a plane with a terrorist on it, especially if that terrorist is not recognized or brand new. Well, I wouldn't mind being fingerprinted if traveling, but then again I'm whitebread and I get to do whatever I want. So is there a race/nationality issue here? Could this be abused by US officials if they "suspected" someone of "suspicious" behavior?   That wasn't what I was going to rant about, but no matter. I'll give you a topic:   Bring It On , while being your typical teen romantic comedy, appears to be at heart a feminist vehicle. Do you agree or disagree? Discuss amongst yourselves.

       a bold statement   I'm going to risk incurring the wrath of Grant Harville, Chris McGann, Shaun Haber, and any one else I know who worships  The Simpsons . But I have to say it, because it's true.    urlLink  Futurama   is just so much better.   First of all, any theme song that uses glockenspiel is genius, in my book.   On all levels the show is wittier, racier, and more intelligent than the Simpsons (although intelligent is always used loosely when referring to televison), and it's prettier too. Those yellow people always got on my nerves. I think it has something to do with having more options to work with: suburbia middle America or the wide wide universe. Which has more room for comedic gold, honestly?   I suppose you could make a case for both shows being genius as they are from the same pen, but I think that Futurama is Matt Groening all grown up and given free reign to really annoy people. The more I watch it, the less I am able to stomach half an hour of the Simpsons. Unfortunately for me, Futurama has been sent to rerun city and the Simpsons remains a prime time hit.   I haven't really much of a case here, as I haven't watched any of the new Simpsons episodes in a while, and I'm tired and in desperate need of snu-snu. I'm still impressed by the glockenspiel.

       the crazy things they do in sweden   I have been randomly getting the Christian Lindberg newsletter; I didn't sign up for it but I suspect they snagged my email address from the OTJ. Even if I knew where to sign up for CL's updates, I probably wouldn't. Because lately he's been getting on my nerves. Here's the latest:   >>Guess Lindbergs Marathon time and win  Edition Tarrodis CL-Marathon-CD Box On 5th of June Christian Lindberg will run a Marathon for the fourth time, in Stockholm, Sweden. First time in Stockholm it took him 4 hours and 15 minutes, second time in Berlin 3 hours and 54 minutes, but last year an injury stopped him at 29km. Edition Tarrodi, who publishes Christians compositions, will present no less than ten prizes to the ones who are closest in guessing Lindbergs time this year.  There is no cost whatsoever involded. Just simply write the time you guess, together with your home adress to:   info@tarrodi.se  First off, if you don't know who CL is (and I can't blame you for trying), he's the Britney Spears of trombonists. Not to mock his talent (which is enormous) or his work ethic (you don't go from beginner to world performer in two years without doing some time in the practice room) of course, but puh-lease.   However. *Ahem* Lately CL seems to be...a tad full of himself? Getting this email is akin to receiving those family christmas letters that rave on and on about how wonderful the children are and what high powered career they have chosen. So Cl is raking in the dough composing, performing, recording and conducting, and he runs marathons on top of it all?   (is four hours good for a marathon? It'd probably take me four  weeks , as I am, as always, NOT A RUNNER)  And what do you win if you guess his time correctly? Christian Lindberg goodies!!!  The first prize is 25 CL cds, and the runners up either get more cds or scores he's arranged.   Wow.   Too bad I have a hard enough time going to your run-of-the-mill CD shop and finding someone BESIDES Lindberg playing the David. Because I could win it too. Wow.   Well, I'm just being cynical anyhow. Anyone want to wager a guess? We can make an average of all the guesses logged on Buddha Stew and send in our answer. I'll burn you a copy of Christian Lindberg Plays the Classics with His Bumhole.   Or better yet, you can just have it.

       to party or not to party   Adam has invited me to his house tonight for a bash. I'm torn about going, I'm not sure if I'm tired or hyper, I'm not sure if I feel like driving, staying the night, or socializing. Part of me is afraid I'll wake up to another raging fire (it seems to be a trend when partying with Adam). Kidding.   If this were Madison, and I could walk there, no problem. But Adam, I live in lame-ass north county! (your words) And you are so far away.   Actually, the drive is just a way of justifying the incredible lack of energy I have for parties right now. I've entered a phase were I really only feel like hanging out with one or two people at time; anything more is a strain on my already tapped social lexicon. Or maybe I'm just becoming a hermit. Or maybe I just need hugs and love and parties are often the opposite of that. Maybe maybe maybe!   May I reiterate: I cannot wait to start grad school. New adventures. Challenges. Things within walking distance. I'm excited.

       the year i turn 23...   Happiest of New Years to you. I think I definitely enjoy New Years-it's one of the only holidays I remain uncynical about.   My NYs consisted of two vodka cranberries, half a bottle of champagne, a baileys hot chocolate, and the one-two punch of Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom in  Pirates of the Caribbean . Katie came over and we bonded with the alcohol and the hotness. Spent a great deal of today regretting the champagne. Bleh.   I'm not one for resolutions but I have a few things I want to accomplish in the new year.  -Get into graduate school -devote all my energy to becoming a rockin' trombone player -start swimming again -become a competent vegetarian cook -have steady income, increase cd collection -kick bush out of the white house!!!  After some thought I've decided to postpone my recital until after auditions. I'm picturing sort of a farewell/send off concert before I move off to grad school. The thing is, I am really struggling with embouchure issues and I feel that I might be doing more harm than good with the work I've been doing. So I'm going to cancel the recital, see Sean and hopefully figure out what the problem is. Then I have a month to readjust and perfect my music. I'm golden on the pieces I have prepared; I just can't play them very well because of my difficulties finding the correct embouchure. Right now I'm having trouble shifting register, and still getting that rough sound when I play loud. Preparing a recital is definitely something I want to try on my own this year, but it's not a good idea right now. I plan on paying my accompanist for a few sessions though, so I can play the pieces with piano and get used to that.   Countdown to Jerry: 6 days!  My mom surprised me the other day, and asked if I'd like to have Jerry sleep with me while he's out. I like this. I like knowing that my mom trusts me and respects Jerry. It's nice to be considered an adult. Can't say fairer than that.   Tomorrow we find out if I am staying on as a Penney's employee or join the ranks of the unemployed. I'm definitely done with that job. This will probably come out sounding terribly stuck-up, but that job is definitely below me. I resent that it makes me stressed out about silly things, how the jeans are folded or how much I have to pick up off the floor. I have respect for the people who do these things, I just don't feel that it's something I should get upset about or bitch about. I'm going to go hunt around and see if I can't find a place that's willing to hire another lifeguard, just to bring in some cash while I prepare for auditions. I'll get some from coaching, but it would be nice to get out of the house every now and again as well. Plus, it'll make me swim, I'll have no choice. :)   I spent so much time napping and lazing around today that I have no desire to go to bed, which is bad because I want to get up at a respectable hour and get stuff done. I'm tired of sleeping in so late (don't laugh at me, I am a nerd) and feeling like I only experience five hours of daylight (which is true). If it's nice tomorrow I'll go for a walk or ride my bike or do something! I've been slacking on exercise-which doesn't bother me so much as how I've spent the good portion of the last two months indoors. I'd feel better about myself if I get outside and get some fresh air.   Okay, enough talk. Gotta find something to wear myself out so I can actually do these things.

       you piss me off, bush, and there's no two ways about it    urlLink here's some stupid stuff you said.   "The union of a man and woman is the most enduring human institution, honoring -- honored and encouraged in all cultures and by every religious faith. Ages of experience have taught humanity that the commitment of a husband and wife to love and to serve one another promotes the welfare of children and the stability of society."  Okay, I'll cut right to the chase, because all y'all know how I feel about same-sex marriage. I can argue til I'm blue in the face about the rights of people to...have the same rights as other people, but many have done it far more eloquent than I. What I'd like to rant about is how offended I am by this "time honored man-woman" bullshit rhetoric.   Marriage's "ages of experience" is a long history of patriarchal man-woman relationships. Women were property, and marriage was a business contract. This commitment of men and women to "love and serve each other" gave men the right to beat, rape, behead, and otherwise abuse their wives, and it gave women the right to...make (male) babies. In some countries and some religious faiths, it was perfectly alright to have many many many wives, just as it was alright to condemn women who tried the same sort of sexual freedom as whores. You may think that things have changed, that marriage has become a truly loving and endearing commitment of one person to another. Men will do chores now, and women work. You know why this happened? Because people fought to change it..somewhere back in the turn of the century, women began to get a glimpse into the true oppression that is gender roles and double standards. They fought against it. It happened in the 60s, too, believe it or not, after things regressed back to medieval standards (in the name of the American Dream). Marriage is not the same as it was "ages" ago, and we have feminism to thank for it. So when I hear talk of "sanctity" and "time-honored" I feel sick. I don't intend to get married until I can get married in a society that doesn't define marriage for me. I don't want to get married because I don't want to face the assumption that I will have kids, or leave work to take care of them, or take my husband's name and do his dishes. I want to marry because I love someone.   Isn't that why anyone wants to get married?   Fuck you, Bush. You're afraid. You're afraid of what will happen to your cookie cutter shiny happy marriage if gays and lesbians are allowed full legal access to marriage in this country. You're afraid to be emasculated, to have to define your own actions instead of having gender roles define them for you. You're afraid to think for yourself. Who will do the laundry if two men get married? Does that mean you might have to do the laundry someday (after we kick you out of the white house and you're dirt poor with no Hispanic maid to do it for you)? Does it make you feel like less of a man to see two women together, who have no interest in your, your penis, or your daddy's money? You're afraid, plain and simple. You know what? I don't have to say "fuck you" because you'll do it to yourself. Give me back my damn country, asshole.

       i is tired   Blogging from the Music office at Loyola University, where I am spending a few days with  urlLink Val  before my flight to Montreal (friday). Sad and tired. Sad because I miss the Jerry already, and tired because I got little sleep last night and then got up early. Uneventful bus ride, although Grant was there. Val met me downtown and I sang with her choir. It was quite entertaining, and I actually read pretty well for not being much of a singer. When I'm back at school, I will definitely make an effort to either be in a choir or take voice lessons. The idea being, my trombone playing improves. Hrm.  Definitely feeling nostalgic, pensive, and poetic tonight. Madison is home. I imagine that in the fall I will have a new place to call home, a solidified existence that's all my own. For now, returning to Madison is like putting the pieces back together. I know my way around, I know who to see, where to go, and what to do. I became myself there. It sounds corny and all, but true. Until the next stage of my mental/emotional development takes place I am inherently attached to Madison. I want to go to school again. I'm tired of feeling bullshit like this. I mean, not that feeling Madison is home is bullshit, but that I don't have a place to truly call home and therefore must be silly and nostalgic instead of getting on with life. Sigh.   Tired, like I said. Want sleepies.

       oh how quickly the time passes   I'm alive, I swear. I haven't got much to post. On Wednesday already I am going back down to Chicago to spend a little time with Val, and then Friday leave for Montreal. I'm excited to go, but I've been incredibly lax with practicing since my DePaul audition and am hoping all will go well.   Only two more full days in Madison, and with Jerry-pants. Hard to think that when I leave this time we have no guarantee of when we will see each other next. That's a little scary, but I know I can handle it this time. If all goes well I will probably spend the summer in Madison, Jerry will move to New York in the fall and I to Montreal, and we will see each other much more frequently. Dreamin' again. Really, though I am mostly looking forward to being in a new place, meeting new people and creating a network of friends again. It will all be twice as good if I can be near to Jerry and escape to him for comfort or friendship if necessary.   Life is hard you know. But some beautiful things are happening that make me feel good. Here's  urlLink one  of them.

       i spent money   Here's what I got:    urlLink  Persepolis   by Marjane Satrapi. A graphic novel about the author's childhood during the Islamic Revolution in Iran. SOOO GOOD. I finished it in about an hour. And I cried.    urlLink  Reading Lolita in Tehran   by Azar Nafisi. In keeping with my readings on Iran and the women affected by the regime in power. So far, it's intense. As I see more and more how our view of the world is jaded and twisted in America, I desire to understand what it's really like.    urlLink  Body Outlaws: On Body Image and Identity   edited by Ophira Edut. Looks interesting. The "barbies I'd like to see" is hilarious.  Tori Amos  Tales of a Librarian  and the new Ani  Educated Guess . I'm set. And broke. Cheers to that. :)

       are you at home now? with your kitty-kat?   it's not my home and it's not my kitty-kat, but it is now. Or something. Davis is off to school and I'm just hanging out in her apartment, playing with Maggie, who is hilarious and frisky. A combination that is quite entertaining in a young cat. She's bored, I think. She keeps climbing up on my leg and mworwing, but she has food and she doesn't want to cuddle. We've played. We've petted. I can only do so much, cat! ;)   It's nice today, to be relaxed and have some time to myself. I think I will do yoga and practice a little. Not too much. Mark Fisher gave me some great advice on breathing, and I will just warmup enough to reinforce that (if you're curious: I've been told to treat my horn as if it were a breathing apparatus, ie similar to a BERP, because I am not translating the work I do on my toys to my actual horn. Also, to make a LOT of noise when I breathe, and not to "apologize" for breathing. It's fantastic advice, and I'm eager to put it to work at my McGill audition). Mostly I've just been catching up on blogs and such. There are two posts at  urlLink WHB  that I would love to address, but it might be a while.   Davis has an insane amount of feminist books, and I'm itching to steal them. Mwahahaha. However, I will pay a visit to A Room of One's Own whilst in Madison, where I want to pick up Derrick Jensen's  A Language Older Than Words , some Audre Lorde, Toni Morrison, Shere Hite, Robert Graves'  The White Goddess  and anything else I can get my hands on. For limited cash. It would actually be cheaper at Amazon, so I will make a list of stuff I didn't get and add it to my wishlist. Sigh. If only I had a rich benefactress. Exclusive Company is also on the shopping list, with the new Ani album and Desert Sessions on the list.   Okay, the cat is freaking out. Wow.   And I'll tell you a Buddha Stew secret. I'm excited to go to Montreal and find one of the sex shoppes that makes Canada so cool. Stop dissin' Canada everyone (who has recently dissed Canada to me-Mr UMich Marching Band guy on the train to Chicago, that means you), because Canada rocks. Anyway, I suppose I could always go to A Woman's Touch in Madison (and doesn't Madison just kick serious ass for having both AROOO  and AWT? you bet it cuntlovin' does), but Montreal! Sex Shoppes! French speakers! Hurray!  Places I really really really REALLY must be this year:    urlLink March for Women's Lives  in D.C. April 25th. MUST GO! Marisa called me on Thursday to say I had to go, as she is. Well, good for you, being an eastie and driving there. Argh. Anyone want to donate money to my cause? No credit cards please (I'm half serious. Send me to DC and you'll never regret it!) only checks or cash. Man, if that TJ gig hadn't fallen through it would have been no problem. I WILL get a job when I return to CA. WILL. MUST. Argh.    urlLink Rafael Mendez Brass Institute  in Boulder June 7-13. Davis is going with her quintet. I wish I had a quintet, or a bone quartet. I know I asked about it already, but if you want to form a group...please let me know. It's cheaper if you go pre-formed. Perfect for me. Nuttin' but brass chamber music all the livelong day. So I either need three trombones or two trumpets, a horn, and a tuba. Anyone, anyone?   *Sigh* So much excitment in the world, so little money. I'm toying with the idea of going for broke and just doing everything I want to do...because what else would be the point of a year off? I'm taking time off to...have time. Time to do the shit I want to do before school weighs me back down. Like March for justice and intensely practice chamber music. The money can be made later, and really, how important is it to be secure financially when it's just as fulfilling to have great experiences, books, music, and conversations over deep mugs of chai?   Yeah.

       k-a-l-a-m-a-zzzoozzoo i gotta girl...   a quick update from the road. Three auditions down, one to go.   UMich-pretty good. Liked the school, the people, the professor. Seems like a good place to be. Good to see Grant and Jennii. Ran into Clay Wacholz (sp?) and Emily Robida. Audition was okay, better than ASU but perhaps not the way I expected to play. Ah well.   DePaul-super. Looooove Mark Fisher. Would love to study with him. Didn't really get a chance to talk to or see much of the school, so I'll have to be in touch with the grad students I have emails for to get more of a feel for the place. My audition was more like a lesson, and I took a lot out of it. I hope he likes what he heard.   Met up with Davis and we headed back to K-zoo, which is where I am currently. Tomorrow I will meet Ann Hoppe (HURRAY) for dinner, and then head to Madison on Tuesday. I can't wait to see everyone! Youngblood on Friday night and cuddles with Jerry-pants. Relaxation until I head back to Chicago, see Val, and then go to Montreal. I'll try to sneak a lesson with James Campbell in while I'm in town. I'm glad to be almost done, and to have a reprieve from the traveling.  and now...back to Ocean's Eleven.

       if i'm a sucker for anything, it's gotta be...   the  urlLink Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show .   Yep, that's right. I love me my dog show. Not just any ol' dog show, the big 'un. Dogs dogs dogs. Rockin'.   This year's Best in Show is  urlLink "Josh" , a Newfie. He's pretty cool, but I wanted the  urlLink Ibizan Hound  to win. Ah well. She's a winner in my heart.   So, the dogs are great and all but I really have to admit that sometimes I just watch it for the way the  urlLink announcer guy  says "antiquity." It gives me a moistie. Okay, not really. But it does remind me of the Flight of Dragons and how much I absolutely adored that movie as a kid. I still do. Plus the chick's name is Melissande. That's sweet. Too bad the hero isn't Peleas. Well, you can only ask for so much out of life.   I leave you with these beautiful thoughts for the next coupla days. Bright and early tomorrow morning I am off to Ann Arbor, auditioning on Friday. Then I'll be in Chicago, Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids (maybe), Chicago, Madison, Chicago, Montreal. But I'll see you before. Blogging will occur in one of those cities. I promise. Schmu schmu, I love you.

       fighting vainly the old ennui   i'm bored-ish. no real desire to look up exciting/infuriating news on the internet, can't stand to play my trombone another minute, can't finish packing until i've done laundry, have the irrepressible urge to type in lower case. i've cruised through a couple of old bs entries (a journey into the wayback machine...the stew is almost three years old! and how far we've come since that long post where i sang sean odenwalder's traffic lights song. sigh. it's such a beautiful thing). in the spirit of 510 n henry street, madison, wi 53703 (home of corporal zulu and hairgel eating) i give you a taste of the old stew, in all its glory.  the other night i had a dream about ryan. hahahahaha! i laugh. ryan. how silly that whole thing was, and yet how essential to the development of my character today. i don't recall the specifics of the dream. it just got me to thinking. what's ryan "i'm afraid of girls but i think i'm really cool" smith up to these days? is he still in new york, writing bing-bang-zoom-whoosh music? is that smile still infectious? if he randomly called me one day, would he call me the nickname he gave me?   mostly i'm feeling pretty ambivalent about the whole thing. i have forgiven my prior self for being girlie and crazy and maybe even a little psychotic. this is past. i still regret the loss of a very good friend, the first person i truly felt comfortable around at college. but, it's past. gone-o-roo-la.   in response to  urlLink davis'  questions about grad school and alex, i initiated a rant that i had a hard time getting out of. but in the end, it made a ton of sense (at least, to myself). all that time i spent moaning and bitching about ryan i was blaming him for something i brought on myself. i'm not totally freeing him of responsibility, because he certainly didn't do anything to rectify the situation...in fact i believe his reaction was to run away and never speak to me again...but. but but but. i was amiss in thinking he was responsible for my happiness. no. only i am responsible for my happiness. other people merely help the process. ryan was in no way required to date me, fuck me, or otherwise employ my emotions just because i liked him. nay, was infatuated with him. i can ask that of no one. attraction must be mutual...to be attraction. any bitchin', moanin' or whinin' i did was my own choice, and i was not grown up or self-realized enough to stop these things and move on for a long time. true, everyone recovers from unrequited or requited or whatever crazy donkey love at their own pace, but i'd like to give myself much more credit that i actually did. i'm grateful that i can look back the experience with new tools of analysis and perspective. yay, girl power. women rule. boys drool. or something like that.   i'm growing up. and i like it. moon goddess strong woman radical feminist riot grrl riding valkyrie reigning fire down from valhalla. weeee, muthafucka, weeeeeeee.

       no place more humbling...   than the desert. The great wide expanse of land that isn't empty, no, not in the slightest, but full and resounding with beauty with life with energy if you know where to look.  And I encourage you to, indeed, take a look. I will go with you. It is a place I feel safe in traveling through, the last great uncontrolled (by human hands) environment. Freedom. Oh, were I but a lizard on your sandy red boulders, dearest desert. What times we would have.   Back across the desert, up up the mountains and down down to the sea, I return to you. I am feeling poetic as if it were a hormone injected into my blood or injested along with macaroni and cheese. It comes from listening to Ani incessantly and reading  Cunt  voraciously. And the joy I get from the raw, wild desert.   However, I imagine my audition was less than poetic. It was not bad. Maybe not good enough for a potential graduate student. I have no idea what they expect to hear. I no longer care what it was actually like. The next will be better. Besides, all I could ask for was that Valkyries went off without a hitch, and it did. Schmu.   I reconnected with an old friend. Sommer moved to Phoenix in middle school, and since our communication had died to a mere murmer. Yet we met this weekend, and got caught up. She has grown into a woman I am very proud of, and there was no difficulty in feeling like buds again. A beautiful thing. Should I indeed go to school there (if my audition was better than I suspect it sounded) I will have a connection and a very good one, at that.   So, now I must prepare for my big travels. The one that might require my entire inventory of underwear (and long underwear). That might find me stranded somewhere in Detroit or Chicago with a large suitcase and a trombone, or it might go off flawlessly and effortlessly. We shall see. I get to go to Canada! I get to wear scarves and hats and mittens! I will meet and befriend new people! I will impress amaze and astonish three more professors of music! Life is beautiful!  I'm very tired. More tomorrow. Happy Sunday, all.

       what's the  last  thing you want to be doing on a sunny afternoon?   For me, it's going to have to be cleaning smouldering palm tree nuts and rat shit out of my car engine.  A little background information: I park my car (the steadfast '99 beige Contour lovingly referred to as ED) outside as my parents' cars get the garage. We have three palm trees in the front yard, Katie, Jenn, and Lauren are their names because when we were young (and oh so sweet) my best friend, her sister and I declared them to be arboreal manifestations of ourselves. We also have a colony of roof rats.  I myself have never seen the roof rats; I know Jerry has, and my dad found a dead one once. I only know of their existence because at 2 am they get especially frisky and run about merrily on the roof above my bedroom. They sound HUGE. Fuckin' huge. They eat palm nuts.   Not too long ago I had my car tuned up. When I went to retrieve her, I was promptly scolded by the repair guy for "letting the rats leave a nest in my engine." In my defense, I had no idea this was the current practice of our resident roof rats. My parents did, however, because it happened to the Cadillac (may she rest in peace) when it was parked on the street. A discussion insued as to how to halt the nesting instincts of  roofus raticus  but we reached no formal conclusion. I declined to have rat poison under the hood as I would be disgusted to have dead rat present in my car at any period in time. Parking it in the garage is not an option as leaving another car outside would subject it to a similar fate. Talks ceased, and life went on as normal.   Today I was blithely on my way to Hidden Valley Middle School to teach. The birds were singing. The sun was shining. The sharp, aromatic smell of wood fire was in the air. It remained in the air all the way up to Escondido, at which point I realized my engine was smoking.   The palm nuts were buring. It's a nice smell and all, but it's a little disconcerting to suddenly have your car turned into a giant incense burner without your prior knowledge.   So, instead of coaching (and let's all shead a tear for that 70 bucks that was not added to my checking account this afternoon), I spent the time scraping nuts, rat shit, and snail shells out of my engine. It was not pleasant, and I don't recommend it. For now, my car is parked across the street in the hopes that the rats will be confused and not be able to find it.   Ah, the trials of living.

       (exasperated)sigh    urlLink La Cucaracha  is especially fitting today.   And I want to link you again over to  urlLink Green Fairy  because I don't want you to get any false notions about how great America is. We could be. If we'd stop fucking things up. That is to say, if the people in power would stop fucking things up and start listening to what people actually think.  I am frightened by the ability of hate groups (masquerading under positive names- "Pro-Life" is a nice way of saying antiabortion. To be truly pro-life, however, you would have to concede that a woman...is a life. I know that's a big step. Let's take it slow here) to mobilize quickly and effectively, to use religion to convince people of the wrongness or rightness of something, and to scare politicians and policymakers into submission. I don't think the majority of Americans believe abortion should be illegal, but those voices are overpowered by the angry ones, the people who are threatened not by the loss of life (because then they would have to consider more than just the fetus as a live) but by the loss of power. Fear is the greatest motivator. Go on over to  urlLink Echidne  and read her post (jan 30) on "The Manly Art of Politics." Some talking heads are afraid that politics is over femininzed. It goes hand in hand with Bush's stance on machoism and revenge: power! greed! punishment!   And that's where I get lost in the debate. Why should politics be "masculine" when half of the population is "feminine"? Shouldn't they have  everyone's  best interest at heart? Don't laugh. I'm serious. Which is why I find myself feeling more and more lost and hopeless in this big, bad-ass, macho country. I understand that the majority of Americans are not extremists like anti-abortionists, and so at the same time I understand that not everyone's a radical feminist. I just like to hope that most people swing in that direction when it comes down to talking rights, improvements, and actions.   This is good news though:  urlLink Massachusetts High Court rules for Gay Marriage .

       just tired, that's all   I had a power lesson with Sean tonight in which we ran all of my excerpts, the Bozza and a little of the Stevens. Last Wednesday when we met I felt like a new trombonist; he helped me get over my weird playing issues and start on a strict diet of positive thinking. Tonight was just the same-so much invaluable advice and teaching. He's an amazing teacher because he has worked so hard to be a good player, and put in the time not just in the practice room but into research as well.  I said positive thinking. Instead of blogging, I should be going to bed, sleeping well, and waking up refreshed to start working all of the things he suggested. But I'm blogging, because the positive thinking isn't so easy right now. I'm so excited to go and do my auditions and to experience all the possibilities of the schools I have chosen. But part of me is unable to quell this fear that I'm just not good enough. That a graduate student should be some sort of super trombonist who never cracks notes and plays everything in tune. Silly. I know this. It's not entirely true. Of course, no one in a perfect world would ever crack notes. But I do. A lot. Is there a redeeming quality to my musicianship that will stand out at auditions? I've worked hard. Should I have worked harder?   No. It's best that I sleep. There's still time for improvement, and I  am  a good musician. The parts that get in my way...are all in my head.   Still, every now and again a good cry helps. Like any spell of depression, misery loves company, and my misery over music is joined by my misery over missing my support group of musicians who understand. Hey Kids...I miss you guys. I can't wait to see you.   I maintain, as I always have, that the greatest part of music is the people you meet. Sweet dreams, friends.

       Dear Federal Communications Commission,   Like many Americans, we were shocked by the exposure of one Ms Sun Jackson at the halftime of this year's Super Bowl. While we too feel the episode is deplorable and saddening, we would urge you to exercise caution during your investigation of this matter.   Too often in our society the blame is placed on a breast or breasts for actions, or exposure such as this one, when the real focus should be put on the ways in which breasts are otherwise exploited and maligned in our culture today. We do believe that Ms Jackson should be responsible for her actions, if indeed she had a hand in the proceedings, but that in many ways she has acted out of influence from popular media and should not bear the full front of this investigation. We here at the National Ova and Breast Representation Association (NOBRA) feel that you should take certain societal factors into account as you research the incident.  In today's society, misbreastgeny is at an all time high. Breasts face oppression, high standards of perfection, and contradictions in regards to activity and appearance. Culture has dictated that all breasts must garb themselves in the constricting and concealing attire of bras, but there is a high market for free breast pornography. With such contradiction in the media, young breasts today are growing up with a sense of low self-worth. They are broken down into two confining stereotypes: that of the "good" breast, and that of the "slut." These stereotypes often do not originate in behavior; something as trivial as size may determine the social status of a breast. This dichotomy is especially damaging as it does not allow for free reign of expression and experimentation in young breasts today, and many grow up without coming into a true sense of self. Combine this with the constant barrage of media attention to this perfect breast or that, never showing a true spectrum of breasts, and you have a recipe for disaster.   The Perfect Breast must never sag or be oddly shaped, it must be round and full, with the nipple in proper position. It must be hairless, smooth, and tanned. In many cases, it must be altered in size in order to more genuinely titillate the senses of the penis. It is a sexual object at the same time that it is confined to the "traditional" and oppressive roles of motherhood and childcare. The two are mutually exclusive; a breast cannot be sexy at the same time that it is nursing because this creates anxiety and disgust in the opposite sex. You can see how these divisions seek to contain the freedom and rights of the breast, and allow for further degradation in the media and popular culture.   We ask that you review the case of Ms Jackson with a few questions in mind: Was she reacting to certain cultural dictates that say she, as a breast, can only make news by being sexy and controversial? Was she betrayed by these forces into thinking that it was a proper response? Ask yourself how this case might be different if the breast in question had not been black. Do we assign different standards and stigmas to breasts of color?   Most importantly, should not the hand, which played an important role in the event, also be questioned and held accountable? To many viewpoints, ours included, the incident resembles a sexual assault on the part of the hand, and this is why it is offensive. The breast is too often used as a sexual object controlled by the objectifiers. If we had a healthier outlook on breasts, their rights, and freedoms, perhaps this episode would not have happened. Being a breast is, after all, not something we can help. We are just as nature made us, and it is time for us to stand up and be proud of who we are for individuals. It is time also to reject the standards that have been set and make new ones that reflect a proper and reasonable response to episodes such as this. We ask you to forgive Ms Jackson her "blunder" but remember that she is an adult capable of making her own decisions. Thank you for taking the time to hear our case,  Yours sincerely, Hildegard and Clara Husting Co-Presidents, NOBRA

       southern california: it's not just for weather-wimps anymore   Went over to Borders for my Monday Night Chai, plunked myself down in front of the "women's studies" section (in quotes because some things don't really belong there, and also, they are too lazy to alphabetize it. tsk tsk. Shoulda hired me when you had the chance, bitches....I mean, you still can. I need a job. Please hire me!), and found a very interesting book:  urlLink  Indigenous: Growing Up Californian  , by Cris Mazza.  Mazza's life, in the pages I flipped through, parallels mine in some pretty crazy ways. She grew up in San Diego, which was my first draw to the book. She played trombone in marching band, one of the first girls in her school to do so. The way she talks about gender politics as it relates to band ring true for me, and she deftly describes what it's like to be a "girl among trombonists"...I would love to read that section in depth. She went away to the Midwest (Chicago) for school. While there, she dealt with all the stereotypes I dealt with (do you miss the weather? do you surf? is everyone blonde? do you see a lot of celebrities?) and was equally as frustrated. She also devotes a chapter to the San Diego Symphony, its financial woes, and how America views the arts. It's fascinating. I've added it to my wish list (oh, if I could read everything I wanted to) because I'm just stunned at our similar lives and her insights on being a Californian.   My friends in Wisconsin will attest to how annoyed the following question made me: "Why in the world would you come here when you live in Southern California?" The implication is that weather determines how great a place is, and that once you've lived there, you can't live anywhere else. Incidentally, the questioner would always follow up the statement with "I could never live there. I like seasons. Plus, what's Christmas without snow?" thus annoying me further. We have seasons, bitch. It's raining right now. Because it's winter, and that's what it does. Oh, but you're right, we don't have any Christmas spirit here. We suck.   Anyway, my responses to this question got more creative with time (usually I would invoke a stereotype of Wisconsin just to get back at them: "I like the smell of cows" "I wanted to see how much bratwurst I could eat in four years" etc). The truth is, I love Wisconsin. I love San Diego. I love being from both places. Well-rounded character traits and all. While I will play along with stereotypical jokes about either locale, I retain the right to ignore anyone who is genuinely insulting or ignorant.   There are of course downsides to both locations. I am not enjoying my year here in SD because I have few friends, am dependent on my car, and live in the suburbs. Were I in the thick of the action downtown, I would in all likelihood feel differently. San Diego frustrates me with its conservatism (it is after a military town with a high population of retirees and ex-Midwesterners) and its racism (you can quote diversity statistics, but the truth of it is that Hispanics get a very, very,  very  bad rap here). But Madison could similarly frustrate me with its little hypocrisies as well. Any place is like that, because people have different viewpoints anywhere you settle.   Like Mazza, I too can discount any of the stereotypes people have of southern Californians just on the basis of people I know. The friends who were born here, raised here, and consider themselves San Diegans are the least stereotypical of all. Many times at school I felt myself slipping into stereotypes just so I could get some attention, but the truth of it is I'm not a surfer, I'm not blonde, and I don't rollerblade with my poodle (but I do have a poodle...man, it just occurred to me what a jip poodles get. That is a damn stupid name for an otherwise wonderful dog). The surfer exists, and I'm not knocking it. Someday I too would like to be a surfer, because it looks like fun and I like the ocean. The characteristics I love best about San Diego and San Diegans are the most often overlooked. The ocean is great, but you can't deny the beauty of our mountains, our canyons, and our deserts. San Diegans are some of the most fit people in the country (and that is a stereotype), because of the nature of our environment. Hiking, biking, swimming, and just plain walking are so enjoyable here because of the things you get to look at while you are doing said activities. If a friend comes to visit me, I will take them to Torrey Pines because it is breathtakingly beautiful, but I will also take them to Los Penasquitos to get a true feel for chaparral and canyon wildlife (friends who visit me will always be taken hiking. You cannot escape it, do not even try).   Well, there you have it in plain english why RW: San Diego pisses me off so much. There is a nightlife here, sure. But it ain't all we do, and those idiots will be sorry they didn't ever get east of the airport (quite a task, I assure you; the airport being almost on top of the harbor). But more than that, I hate to see my pretty city get stereotyped and pigeonholed. Pan your camera over the Mission Beach boardwalk all you want, but that ain't the half of it. I think the wildfires surprised some people back east because they didn't realize how much wild land San Diego County actually includes. That before the palm trees and well-manicured lawns it was all scrub brush and cactus. Fire is a way of life. Many of us despaired to see our mountains and canyons go up in flames almost as much as the devastating loss of homes and lives. Those of us with common sense do not appreciate the Governator. Electricity is not a thing to flaunt. Water is precious. Punk rock is sacred.  So, a word of warning to the haters: the note of scorn I hear in your voice when you say "California should just drop into the ocean and do us all a favor" better damn well fuck off, and you too. Because it's my home, and it's more than just a bunch of blondes and surfers and suburban rich kids. Maybe you should come here and give it a try. Hopefully we won't break off into the Pacific while you're here.

       disappointment   My tuba players quit on me today. Well, I wasn't surprised that Amanda quit, because she always made it quite evident that she didn't care. But David...now, I admit that he had a lot of work to do, and his knowledge of fingerings left something to be desired...but he was a good kid, and he worked hard.   It's all part of being a teacher, I guess. There are ups and downs, and you can't always tell what your kids are thinking. Sometimes you don't even know if you're making a difference. I wouldn't survive as a full-fledged band director for many reasons, but that's the biggest. Does it really matter what I'm doing? Am I including everyone in this progress? Are they all having a good time?  Now that you're all in a somber mood, go on over to  urlLink Green Fairy  and laugh your ass off about death. Go on. Do it.

       duuuude   I found a bag of M&Ms my parents had stashed tonight and was all weirded out when I saw that they were black and white. Okay, so now those commercials with Judy Garland make more sense (I never pay attention to what commercials are selling, in an effort to not feel obligated to buy anything ever). Apparently you can help the M&Ms  urlLink find their color . I dunno. I like the black and white scheme. It reminds me of that awesome scene in  An American in Paris  with the black and white party. There's some cool ass shit going down there. Wouldn't be surprised if people were crack addicts either. Gene Kelly looks kind of dumb, but everyone else is dressed up all wild (it's mostly the costume he's wearing. I mean, if you're going to a black and white party, a joker's costume is like the easiest thing to do. Let's hear it for some black and white creativity, people. Ostriches. Zebras. Pineapples). It's pretty hip, and I'd have liked to have been there.   On another note, I was pissed off about the MTV/Real World  urlLink alleged sexual assault  when I heard about it, but now I'm just damn pissed off at the whole show (wait before you say "just now?"-I was a great fan of RW Seattle, but then again some of those people had common sense and intelligence). Drunken idiots. Making a mockery of my pretty city. Get the fuck out. Either that, or have "Real World: Tijuana" so we can have some more positive images of race (sarcasm alert level: elevated). See how they like living in a tin shack and dealing with Montezuma's curse. Prediction: a cast member will be hospitalized during the first week of shooting after being run down by a Mexican taxi driver. We will listen sympathetically while several other cast members describe the hardships of being in a non-english speaking country, and the anguish they suffer at being laughed at and called "gringos" before having their wallets stolen. The cameras will pan over decrepit neighborhoods as a cast member's voice over states: "It's so humbling...to be in a place where the people have nothing. It's like, you have to  reevaluate  everything you've ever thought. The other day I..*sniff*...oh man, this hard...I saw a roach. In our kitchen. I mean, this is extreme poverty man. I'm going to be such a stronger person, as a house we'll be so close...because we  survived , man, we are survivors."  Remind me never to watch MTV when I'm feeling snarky and sarcastic.

       it's redesign fever!!    urlLink Pamela Ribon , author of the totally awesome book  Why Girls Are Weird , has also done site overhaul today. How exciting. I am trying not to be scared by the gross thinness of the girl's arm. You should check her out; she's quite quite funny.   And to Jerry: well, now you don't have the same blog layout as Pamie. Therefore, you are lame. You should get  urlLink Trogdor , because it is beyond awesome. Trrrrrrogdorrrr!

       blog overhaul   Buddha Stew gets a new look, for the first time in three years. Excitement!   Still playing with stuff. I can't figure out how to get my title in there, and what do to with all the extra space at the top. In the original design, which can be found at  urlLink Lex Designs , there was an image of a waterfall. In my dreams, I see myself replacing that empty space with a thangka of some sort, but I don't even know where to begin with image html. I need the help of my computer types, Shaun? Dan? For now, just tell me how to get rid of that blank stuff. Arrgh.  What do you all think? Yesno? I like it. It's very much something I'd like to play with more, and design my own site. All in good time, which means after auditions. Huzzah.  *update* I put the image back in, for now. Hopefully I won't get in trouble for covering my little ad bar up there. I'm not crying about it or anything.

       follow up topic: relate all you just said to today's society   An answer April's question "What do you think keeps movements apart today? Is it conscious (or unconscious intervention by the patriarchy/How Things Are), or are the members of each movement now primarily responsible for disregarding other movements?"  It's a little bit of both, I'd say. The Powers That Be still keep women apart today through backlash politics. I mean, many young women are afraid still to call themselves feminists, even if their viewpoints fall right in line with women's rights. Feminists are still "femi-nazis," ugly, fat, hairylegged dykes that hate men. Of course this may be true of a handful of feminists, but this characterization came about from constant misinterpretation and whining on the part of white males who felt they were losing their advantage in the workplace or social sphere or whathaveyou. Still, it was  and is extremely effective at keeping women apart. Patriarchy also keeps the women's movement apart with religion, holding certain beliefs (whether they be God-sanctified or not, you can make that shit up anyway) over women's heads who might otherwise support a woman's right to choose or a gay's right to marry. Your religion forbids it, they say, so you wouldn't be a "true Christian" to support it. Also with gay rights, I feel sometimes that the media's representation of lesbians vs gays keeps those two groups apart as well, or could easily serve to. Lesbians have to fight against objectification (of all the lesbian kisses on TV nowadays, how many of them are NOT geared toward the erectile fantasies of heterosexual men?) while gay men have to fight just to be recognized (Queer Eye being a distraction from the real cause, falsely leading people to think that a great leap has been made).   On the other hand, movements keep other movements away as well. I know that homophobia is strong in black communities who feel that it's a white "problem." I can't link the statistic, but I remember reading somewhere that the majority of people opposed to gay marriage are black males (please correct/quote/help me out if I'm wrong). You can examine many reasons why this is so, and I think it ties into what bell hooks has to say about sexism in black civil rights movements as well. Years of fighting has made machoism and control key for young black men, and while a gay man can be both macho and in control, this is not the prevalent stereotype of gays or women (which you could say comes from The Way Things Are and thus furthers to keep the two movements apart) and therefore their rights are second to black rights as a whole.   There you go. I've come full circle. The Way Things Are tries hard to keep people from mobilizing through stereotypes, media enforcement, and political change, while some groups prevent others from joining because they feel their cause is less or not a problem they have, which in turn stems from media representations and prevalent stereotypes. I think my head just imploded. I might need to go cry, fetal position, in a corner, for a while until I feel like I can come back out into the Big Bad World which has none of my interests at heart and seeks constantly to drag me down. Goddammit.

       how lauren got her (feminist) groove back   Two things today that caught my attention.   First: This is no surprise, but  urlLink studies show women are less at risk from breast cancer with an active lifestyle . Simple activities, such as walking or doing chores, are on the list, although chances improve the more strenuous or frequent the exercise is.   Now, the Washington Times put  urlLink a lovely little spin on this.  I have a mental image of a group of writers or editors reading through this article, and being fairly bored by it until they got to that little bit about housework. "Aha!" they said, grinning maniacally. "Proof that women should do the chores! It's good for them!" They choose a writer to put it to text and lean over his shoulder snickering wildly. Now, I would think (and I may be disastrously wrong) that your chances of avoiding ANY kind of cancer would be improved by physical activity no matter what your gender. I also wonder, as a housewife/husband, how much do you counter those positive effects of activity by working with bleach, tile cleaner, ammonia, detergent, and wood polish?   Both links, and a much better commentary, are available at  urlLink Echidne .    Second: When I was in pep band, I LOVED playing for the women's basketball games, because it was exciting to see women tearing down stereotypes and getting physical. Not to mention the team was way better than the boys. Well, win one for the ladies of the court:  urlLink Candace Parker has become the first woman to win the McDonald's High School Slam Dunk Contest . This girl sounds like an all-around player- her last and winning shot was done with her left arm covering her eyes. She's Ms Basketball of Illinois, and she'll probably never have breast cancer. [Link:  urlLink Ms Musings ]  I like to play basketball too, but my best move was never a slam dunk. I'd like to think it was punching Adam Harry in the nose and knocking off his glasses. Yeah, that was pretty sweet.

       it's like i need caffeine, only not   My dad just said "True story" in relation to something (one of his boring recaplets of something golf-associated), and I was immediately filled with the irresistable urge to watch the movie  Clerks . It's so strong I might have to go out and rent it, ASAP.   If I'm feeling frisky I might get  Chasing Amy  and  Dogma , too, but probably not  Mallrats  because I've seen it 80 gazillion times (okay, more like 10).   There I go, exaggerating in multiples of 8 again. It seems to be the only way I can exaggerate, I do it 64 times a day, for Buddha's sake! And then I eat almost 144 muffins! After the muffins, I run to the bathroom at 800 miles an hour!   Okay, I'm done.

       okay, i'm grown-up. what do i want to be?   I'm getting a little sick of my life having so many possibilities.   1. Miracles happen. I get into McGill.  -the positive: I have a direction, a justification to continue learning my music trade. Montreal is an amazing city, and I would become fluent in French.  -the negative: If this isn't what I want to do, should I waste more money and years in it?  2. I move to New York with Jerry. -the positive: Jerry. New York. All for the sake of..moving to New York. Marisa! Could become respected free lance artist. Could intern for feminist organization, change the world.  -the negative: Expensive, I would have to work at something not music related, likely, and not have time to practice trombone. Besides, where would I practice? I've never been to NY, is it wise to move someplace you've never visited first?   3. I get a gig like Chris's in Texas. -the positive: I'll be making money for playing trombone, and I'll be nearby a lot of musical wealth (UNT, etc). I won't have to worry about my cactus and jade hating me because I moved them back to farty weather. Plus, Chris McGann, and Jason if he goes to UNT. Good times!  -the negative: Texas. Also a place I have never been, but unlike NY, not a place I have heard wonderful things about. Again, unlike NY or Montreal, I would not be nearby Jerry, and I don't know if I can withstand another year of that. Again, opportunities for other careers (feminism) limited.   4. Summer in Madison, hang out in the fall and apply for spring admission.  -the positive: Everything about Madison in the summer. Friends, beer, bike rides. A town I know, love, and that isn't too big I can't figure out what to do with myself on a Friday night. A comfort zone, in other words.  -the negative: My crowd is leaving. There will not be the same atmosphere as my undergrad years. Winters suck. Bars suck. Shouldn't I be experiencing new things?   5. Arbitrary city: Portland, Oregon. -the positive: Sounds like a cool place people go to if they want to start over. Lots of punks and hippies and crazy fun stuff to do. Cheap living, and lots of beautiful scenery. -the negative: Again, I've never been there. I'm only interested in it because I read the two page spread in the last issue of Bust and was intrigued. What are the music opportunities there? I'll have no friends from the getgo.   Numbers 6, 7, and 8 can be done in any location, and are not completely mutually exclusive within themselves or with the above options.  6. Hans thinks I should be a writer.  Sure, I can turn a phrase and spell it correctly, but what kind of story teller am I? I suppose you never know until you try. With writing, I can still be a musician.   7. Become a lifeguard trainer, learn pool management.  Jerry might criticize my limited career history, but I say, if you find something you're good at AND enjoy, you shouldn't cross it off the list. Especially when it makes you more money than the average sales job. With this I could be aquatics manager at a community, university, or private pool. I could also become a swim coach.   8. Learn more web development. Whore myself out to companies because they are always looking for web designers. I could combine my feminism with my web skills and work for Ms or FMF or something. My blog would be fantastic and world-famous. With this I could also continue music, or writing, or both, on the side.   So there you have it. The directions my life could turn in are endless and confusing. I think I will pursue no. 8 regardless, and 6 is highly likely. Because no. 1 is a longshot, I'm torn between 2 and 3, with 4 lagging, but not too far behind. Please feel free to elucidate any concerns, comments, or advice you feel you might have in this matter, as I'm always looking to add more pros or cons to the list.   Well, If I'm going keep music as an option, I'd better go make sure I can still play my trombone, at the very least.

       remember the alamo rental car license number   They seriously made a movie about  urlLink The Alamo ? I thought...but, wasn't it a bad thing? Slavery? Er?   I have done my web research.  urlLink This here page  says the Alamo is not quite the legend everyone thinks it is (but then, it wouldn't be a legend if it were true, would it?). The  urlLink brief history  at the  urlLink official website  of the Alamo reads like a sixth grader's oral presentation. Here's a  urlLink timeline  of events from the Daughters of the Republic of Texas (sounds like a party if I ever heard one).   I don't know about all of you, but I'm a little bit weary of historical events getting blown up into big and heroic embodiments of the "American pursuit of freedom" or whatnot. I know it's human nature to idolize and legendize things, but geez. It's like anything's an excuse to make a sweeping motion picture tear-jerker I love America movie. Actually, I'm tired of those kinds of movies anyway. Miracle comes to mind.   Oh yeah, and they're always about men. Men embodying the American pursuit of freedom and showing those dirty foreigners not to mess with Texas, or hockey. Going out and being manly. Other movies don't have to be about America. Like The Last Samurai. Or Dances with Wolves. Oh, yeah and Troy (although I am tempted to see it for the hottie fest it is). It's all such a crock of shit. And it's not like I want to see women in these roles, it's just that I'd like movies to being so inanely patriotic. Can you feel us getting dumber?   And yes, I will be exercising my political dollar and not seeing this movie. Or any of the other ones. I can't be any more eloquent on this topic as the sun has fried my brains. But I think you get what I mean: Here we have a historical event that has been blown out of proportion, given a fish eye lens, and allowed some major Hollywood stars to be big brave men. Yippee!! America is great! Coming out in 2169,  September 11th  starring Kevin Costner's head as George W. Bush and Al Pacino's head as Osama bin Laden! (obligatory Futurama reference) Actually, it probably won't take that long. I predict...oh, 20 years or so. Fred Savage's dramatic acting debut as our beloved pResident.

       employment   Arggh.  This job is not me. I mean, I guess I can do it. It just takes so much energy and bugging people and self-motivation, that I have discovered that I am the kind of person who needs to have structure. A schedule, a list of duties, and payment for them, by the hour.  That said, right now I'm pining away for a lifeguarding job. Water, sun, sitting, bam. All I need. The perfect job. I've called Frog's Club, where I applied earlier, to see if they were still interested in hearing. Left a message. Boo. I have some applications for other pools filled out that I hadn't turned in because I started doing this petitioning shit. Perhaps I will turn those in. Really, it doesn't matter. A steady paycheck. That's all I want. And wearing a bathing suit all day is a bonus. Swimming, bonus. Covered in sunscreen, bonus. Telling people not to run on the pool deck, bonus.

       lubrication    urlLink Banana Boat After Sun Lotion , you are my god.   Seriously folks, have you tried this stuff? It will take away your sunburn overnight. And leave you with one of those radiant golden tans. But I knew this long ago, so why I am blogging about it just now? Well, I haven't used it in a while, because I ran out this summer at Blue Lake and never replaced it (well, I came home and there was this bottle of Caress in my bathroom, and I thought, what the heck). Lo and behold, my father is using it. My sunburn has succumbed to its allmighty power. Amen.   I'm sorry this is like the stupidest blog topic ever (and I'm sorry for apologizing as well), but I'm super tired. Day Two didn't go so hot, owing to the rain and also the locations I chose (people at Home Depot have serious issues, man). Tomorrow I shall hit up Escondido. Haha! You can't hide from me, Escondido! (pun, intended)  The plan is to work Sat, Sun, and Monday, and take Tuesday off. That will save me some running around looking for a Kinkos (I have to make copies of people who register Republican, so they can pay me. Heehehe!) at the last minute like I did tonight. You'd be surprised how hard it is to find a Kinkos when you need one.   Anyway, the whole point of that paragraph was to tell you that blogging will be light, and likely uninteresting/unsubstantial. You are warned. As a send off note:   Things I would like to receive in the mail ASAP!:  1. Natatorium W-2s, so I can do my freakin' taxes! 2. McGill letter, yay, may, or nay 3. Letters from friends 4. Davis' surprise present! OOOOh. I'm excited.

       burninated!   So, my first day on the job! It went fairly quickly, and I did well. Not as well as I had hoped, but I owe that to the fact that the guy didn't give me as many petitions to start out with (a trial run, he called it), but I definitely could have filled in more. I did get almost all of them signed (oh, and by the way, my math was terribly wrong yesterday about that. Are you surprised? I'm not ;), and tomorrow I go in to pick up more forms. I registered a handful of voters, met alternately pleasant and crabby-assed people, and got a vicious sunburn on my left arm and neck. (Note to self, don't forget sunscreen!)  Get paid on Tuesday.    urlLink Margaret Cho  is going to be at the March!!! She has a few shows that weekend, but they are all sold out. Still, I can't imagine she'd be in DC and not come support something she's so vocal about. Excited? You bet.   Okay, I will hire you to rub lotion onto my poor torture shoulders. Owie!

       i'm not a bum any more, guys!   I got a job today. And it was the easiest job getting  ever . In the whole history of job getting. All I had to do was sit through an hour's orientation, fill out a W-9, and pick up some forms, and I'm set.   The best part is, I'm going to be making bank.  Bank , I tell you. (said in Dr Zoidberg voice)  And what's my job you ask? Well, I'm a petition circulator. You know those people that sit in front of grocery stores and get signatures to put things on the ballot...well apparently they're not volunteers, and they're making serious dough. For every signature I get, depending on the particular petition, I get anywhere between $1.50-3.50. There's ten spaces on each petition, I have two sheets of seven different petitions, and if I get just one person to fill out all of them, I get $15.50. If I fill out all 140 slots...well, you do the math (psst...it's $2170). Bank! BAAAAAAAAAAANK!!!!  And, it's given me the only legitimate reason I can't think of to like the Republican party. For each person I register to vote that checks Republican on their form, I get $1.50. Heee!   I can go back and get as many forms as I want, work as long as I want, and get paid twice a week.   Also, this all has to be finished in 5 weeks, which would be just about when I'll be making plans to move (wherever that may be), and if I average $500/day (which they said was absolutely reasonable) 5 days a week for 5 weeks, I will have $12,500 to my name (Davis, if 5 never was my lucky number before, it is now). Feasibly, I could just chill this summer, or just travel all over the fuckin' place. Hells yes.   Again I say, BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANK!!!!!  I start tomorrow. I'm trying to decide where I shall sit. I'm thinking Ralphs, or perhaps the Albertson's over in Carmel Mountain. On Saturday it would be extremely profitable to be at Home Depot, but it doesn't seem to me that they have room in front of their store what with the 2X4s and the palm trees. It seems like it would be a good idea to take a trip north and chill in Temecula or San Clemente, as San Diego is pretty much covered. Hey, the gas'll pay for itself. I like to think of this as a big fundraiser, only I'm the charity and I get to keep the money.  So far, the best part of all of it is, I got to make huge ass posterboard signs, and play with sharpies. I love sharpies.   When I get my first paycheck, I am going to buy myself  urlLink Futurama Vol 1  as a "you rock my world, me" present. And maybe a DVD player while I'm at it. And  urlLink this apron , for Jerry.   Not to mention, now I can pay for my trip to DC. Oh yeah, and go to Colorado for the Brass Institute. BAAAAAAANK!!!!!

       fighting the battle of who could care less   I can't think of anything to blog about. Sorry to those of you who come here for the way I deftly and intelligently handle the issues that face us all in the world today. I promise, I'll be back on top in no time, giving it hard and fast to the haters. Meanwhile, I feel more like being silly and irreverent, or at times charmingly observant about our current version of popular culture.   Speaking of popular culture, guess what I'm listening to?   That's right, it's Fiona Apple's  Tidal .   Just basking in the high school, feeling angst-y and mind-numbingly deep all over again.   And you'll notice that the title of this blog is a reference to yet another classic CD of my past (chocolate to the first contestant to guess correctly!)...I blame  urlLink Erica . Add to that  OK Computer  (Radiohead),  Bringing Down the Horse (The Wallflowers), and  Odelay  (Beck) and you've got a recipe for young, spunky, and carefree Lauren dancing about while eating yogurt. Ah, high school. God bless you. Maybe that's why I want to go punk again. Not even 23 and I'm reclaiming my lost youth. Too bad I'm stuck here in this youth-forsaken place, making myself Baileys Hot Chocolate and watching reruns of the Cosby Show.

       book update   It's going back. I'm only halfway. I flipped through the last couple of pages and failed to arouse myself into any sort of concern for the characters. An utter and complete lack of desire to care. Felt by me.   Some other time then, Mr Bellow, when you've decided to be interesting.   In the meantime, I have decided not to check out any more books (although I might change my mind when I get to library), but instead, I will practice my trombone whenever I feel the desire to read. Therefore, I will begin to acquaint practicizing with the enjoyment I get out of reading, and thus, get better. Sure, I've had a lot of cockneyed schemes, over the years, to get myself to practice more, but this one'll work I can feel it! (Totally sarcasm there, just to warn you)   Truly though, I should practice. I'll never be able to decide if I want to keep playing if I don't actually do it. Plus, the longer I sit on my metaphorical non-practicing ass, the more out of shape my chops will be and thus it will exponentially be less fun to play.   Case in point, my lower lip is having a freak-out session right now (you know, a muscle spasm), and it's likely because I played for about an hour today (and that's a hour longer than every other day). It's mad. Muscles get mad at you when you do stupid shit like that. They are not to be trifled with.   Apparently I did get one thing out of attempting to read  More Die of Heartbreak.  Inspiration to not read, and work harder at my chosen profession. Not a bad trade, eh?

       what's that you say, realone player?   I am frequently amused by the genre classifications RealOne player will give music (ex: Johnny Cash has been labeled "Outlaw Country").  But I'm more than a little baffled by this bit of music trivia that popped up while it was playing "Shrove-tide Fair" from Stravinsky's  Petrushka : "Stravinsky's music evolved to encompass every major movement of the twentieth century. Sexy."  The first statement is technically correct. Sexy? To me it reads like, "*intellectual sounding woman's voice-over* Stravinsky's music evolved to encompass every major movement of the twentieth century. *switch to husky voice* Oooh, that makes RealOne player sooo hot. I've been eyeing your newest 12-tone composition all night and it's driving me insane with desire. How about you and I go up to my place for a coffee? (but I don't drink coffee) I haven't got any. *later* Stravinsky you naughty, naughty Russian you, take me now, make my equalizer quiver with delight!"  It's just that...I think you've got the wrong man, RealOne Player. I think you want Ravel. Or Bernstein. Think about it. Petrushka's an ugly puppet. Sure, it has its sexy bits, but um...no. I suggest giving  Fancy Free  a try. That always gets my motor going.

       coal miner's ewan   Really, there is no movie more suited to Laurendom than  urlLink Brassed Off  (there were better links than this one, but I want you to look carefully at the URL and you'll see why I chose it. Top 'alf only, ya know).   It shines in all of the necessary categories to make it a genuine winner:   1. Use of musical instruments/themes: A+++        a. (sub category)Brass instruments, heavy feature of trombone: BONUS!        b. Musician jokes ("She blows flugel like a dream" "Really Danny, at your age"):               BONUS! 2. Ewan McGregor: A++++++++++ (++) 3. English accents: A+ 4. Strong political themes: A++  Truth be told, however, I would like it just on the basis of this dialogue alone, which I consider to be the best pickup line in the history of film:   Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald): Would you like to come up for a coffee? Andy (My baby's daddy): I don't drink coffee... Gloria: I haven't got any.   However, I would just like to point out that, although it appears that most of the actors took a few brass lessons and had some idea of how to play their instruments, the conductors were terrible! Pete and Jim, I'm ashamed of you. Only choir directors conduct like that. Not a legitimate pattern! Not a legitimate pattern!! AAACK! (Beverly Taylor flashbacks, no, *sob* please, no, stop the madness!)  Well I'll be off then. Ta-ra!

       curl up and dye   I want to grow my hair out to look like  urlLink this.  I don't think it'll take too long, maybe two months or so. Just in time to be extra hot for summer.   And while I'm on the Franka Potente kick (and she's darn well worth it), maybe a little  urlLink Lola red  is in order. Or purple. At any rate, I'm feeling the urge to go punk again, especially since it doesn't seem apparent that I'll have to be "graduate student professional" any time soon. Live while you can, eh?

       "i can't read"--ralphie   I am struggling so hard to finish  urlLink More Die of Heartbreak  by Saul Bellow. Jay-sus, it's driving me crazy from boredom. I'd rather play Pairs II on my cellphone (and I do).   So, why not stop torturing myself and just put it down? Truthfully, though, it's not entirely boring. It's got some action, sort of. In fact it reads as one long stream of consciousness from the point of the narrator, and I get it, it's not hard to understand. It's just so bloody long, for such a simple storyline, not as bad as  Ulysses  (which I also had to force myself to finish) perhaps, but bad enough. I feel like I should give it the benefit of the doubt, and maybe it'll get interesting or at least life-affirming.   At any rate, it's due back at the library on Tuesday. If I haven't managed to get past the 2/3 mark by then or if it suddenly becomes the best thing I've ever read (whichever comes first), I will return it and check out something more enjoyable. Like the concise military history of Tangiers, for example.

       dammit i burned the popcorn!!   Lazy me, I have all the ingredients for a supposedly delicious stew, and I just can't get up the urge to put them all together. And I do this every night. Soon, my cabbage will go bad, the tomatoes are already sketch (that's okay, I don't have to use them...eww, tomatoes!), the potatoes will start growing, and my bell pepper will rot.   First night I was going to make it I found that my mom had eaten the potatoes. Two nights ago I went to make it and I couldn't find my ginger root. Today, my mom found it, sitting in a puddle of peach iced tea that was leaking out of the container. Now all the ingredients are present but...eh. Yes. I feel eh about cooking. Maybe tomorrow. Tomorrow will be the absolute last day I can use that cabbage. The thing is, I selected this recipe because I used cabbage for another stew and I didn't want the rest of it to go to waste. Looks like I'm just a loser.   Passing the time until I go party with  urlLink Blather , which is the band belonging to Chappie, Haber, Dave, and this guy Julien that I met once (kinda cute, eh?). I'm  supposed to be  totally hard at work on horn charts for them.   So, just sitting, eatin' my half-burnt popcorn, laughing (sadly) at my dog, who can't control his hindlegs anymore while walking on slick surfaces and just crashed majorly on the plastic beside the computer chair. Poor Chipper. He's not long for this world, so I try to spend as much time as I can stand his bad breath giving him some attention.   While I brush my teeth and tart myself up, here's the first 10 songs to play at random on my realone player for your enjoyment of my impeccable musical tastes:  1. Bilal-Soul Sista (Shakin' the boot-ay) 2. Brad Melhdau-London Blues (This guy sounds just like Dave Brubeck, Jerry!*sarcasm*) 3. Ruben Gonzales-Tumbao (Ruben is the cutest old man,  ever ) 4. Youngblood Brass Band-Culture: Envy: War (Ain't no party like a YB party. Seriously.) 5. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds- Crow Jane (This CD scares me. Moving on) 6. Sergei Prokofiev/Issac Stern/Philadelphia-Violin Concerto No 1 Mvt 1 Andantino (pretty, but too long. Let's skip to...) 7. Beck-Debra ( Yes!! Going out to the Billings Point girls, I said ladies, step inside my Hyundai) 8. Modest Mussorgsky/Philharmonia Orchestra-Pictures at an Exhibition Promenade/Il Vecchio Castillo (Orchestral literature's best saxophone solo) 9. Ben Folds Five-Underground (I was never cool in school either, Ben. Let's rock!!) 10. Joni Mitchell-Morning Morgantown (let's take in down a knotch. Everyone sway with me!)

Doncha think it'd be nice if the schools would pay you back for all the money spent applying, traveling, and auditioning if they decided they didn't want you? Man, I could use that $75 app fee back.

        urlLink the friday five    If you...   1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?   I would open a 24 hour breakfast place on State Street (or nearby) in Madison, WI. How many times have you wanted breakfast, dear Badgers, but Sunroom was no longer serving and Cleveland's was oh-so-far-away? Also, because sometimes you just gotta have breakfast for dinner. You just gotta. (Although, that place in Montreal was sketch-definitely sketch)   2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?   Feminist bookstore, all the way.    3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?   Likely non-fiction, some sort of analysis or thesis-y type thing. Although, I would write science fiction in a heartbeat if I could come up with some cool ideas.    4. ...ran a school, what would you teach?   I've toyed with the idea of a feminist-inspired school (co-ed) that would be based on principles of equality, etc. More discussion-run classrooms, proper sex ed, co-ed sports, hands-on stuff, real history lessons with emphasis on societal factors (racism, sexism, etc) that make history the way it is, etc. My music program would include a solid ear-training technique, conducting skills, composition, musicology, etc. Conservatory-like.    5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?   My totally kick-ass brass quintet, playing classics, arrangements a la  urlLink Rhythm and Brass  , and my David Bowie Fame-Golden Years-Fashion medley.   On a totally unrelated note, I had Futurama dreams last night. I was Leela, and Fry and I finally got together. It was very sweet and I woke up all warm and fuzzy. I must say I don't think I've ever dreamed in cartoon before. I highly recommend it.

       exciting news, everyone!!   Last night I made it to Level 4 ("Labyrinth Zone") of Sonic the Hedgehog!!!  Of course, some of you who are not aware of the legendary Sega machine that is in my possession are like "Wha?" because you beat that game back when you were thirteen and moved on to better and brighter gaming systems.   Well, I stopped (and began, for that matter) with my Sega, which I saved up the money to buy, and for which I have 5 games (two of them given to me by Jerry last year). I have beaten only one of them, and that is The Lion King. I had the help of one Ms. Sarah Morgan, and we celebrated joyously after tossing Scar over the cliff and taking our rightful place in the Circle of Life. Twas a beauteous day.   On Sonic I could never get past the second act of the second level.   When I finally did (last year, aged 21), I died consistently when the guy, at the end, that you have to fight, would spike me. I can't even remember his name, if indeed I ever knew it.   Well, last night I beat that sucka into the mofuckin' ground! I blew his shit up! Yeah! Oh wait, I have to do it again at the end of the next level. Fuck.   The Labyrinth level is a happy little place with drill-nosed bear creatures and underwater adventures. Sonic makes a cute little sound when he gets air from the air bubbles. The music is even more delightfully 80s than the previous levels. All in all, an enjoyable time.   And, you'll be happy to note, I am well on my way to defeating this level as well (I made it nearly to the end of act three with the fighting and the devilish guy before a trident killed me because I had no rings--that happens often, the lack of rings), so I will notify you of my entry into level five and the pleasures hidden therein.   Also, if anyone could please tell me just how many levels there are, I'd be grateful.

       creativity   I may have gotten myself in trouble last night when I told Hans that I've written some beat poetry. He demanded to read it, and I was hard pressed to find any I'd written that were any good in the slightest, as opposed to silly little pieces of girly fancy. Not to say that there is anything wrong with girly fancy, as in this brave new world of feminism we are supposed to support all things created by girl, but well, anyway, they're shit.   Considering I have this blog, and I update it daily (sometimes with serious, thought-provoking pieces, other times not so much), you would think that I like people to read what I write. Here's the deal: no. Not always. Blogging here has made me feel a little more comfortable with sharing my ideas to the world, but only because it forces me to post, edit, reread, edit, and then sit and bear the weight of your criticism (and man, you guys should really just lay off, jeez) without the blind cowardice of, say, handing in a term paper without asking for advice, proofreading, or even making any major revisions myself. Part of this stems from my arrogance that I am, really (and Hans, you haven't help this), a competent and intelligent author. Lots of work is to be done, naturally. Thankfully, I no longer end papers with some sort of all-emcompassing, awe-inspiring, beautiful sentiment as I used to when proper construction of essays was being drilled into my head (that hourglass figure of introductions and conclusions, start big, narrow down, pan out to the big picture again at the end). I would share, but, unfortunately (awww), I have no papers handy.   However, when it comes down to poetry, or any kind of expression that doesn't draw on my stronger powers of analysis and criticism, I feel extremely intimidated by the outside gaze. To get over this, I must practice.   *ahem*  *drums bongos*  You, world.  Big wide and angry Full of information technology bright lights and jabbering mouths not listening to the soulful tune of a quiet night I feel your self-importance when I go to a bookstore And stare at all the books that I'll never have time to read Not in a million years Everyone's got an opinion A rushing gaping mind that longs to fill the void  To get fifteen minutes To shoot Andy Warhol To Drown Out the Sorrows And who's to say you aren't worth it? Me? That's a laugh.  "et tu, Brute" your best friend conspires You've got dark thoughts dark hearts and dark towers Hidden away is that thing you'd really really really Like to do, poor little lost soul.   A few of my favorite things can't compare to the struggles and desires of billions of people wandering the streets of this earth thinking what is the meaning what the purpose where is my family how will i feed them when will they notice am i a star do i look good am i the boss of me where is my paycheck does he love me is she cheating what shall i read next when shall i write it do i need to diet am i overweight will i pay extra for that airplane seat am i gay am i a woman or a man do i have aids or cancer or high blood pressure or will i live to see tomorrow when will it end what bomb will destroy me what fatal coup what intense hunger what is the purpose what is the meaning...of this?   You can't stop the flood It just keeps flowing over and over the bodies of us The meaning of us time strips away and leaves nothing It's only a game anyway, survival of the fittest or smartest or quickest you've got to  learn.  Keep up with times or don't you Pr/lay for the team or don't you Fight for your rights or don't you Don't you care?  Make the most of what's living and dying hugs and laughter tears and sorrow do what you want it's ALL tomorrow there is no chance to stop and think you'd better just do it.  While you can.  Love for the children who grow up and learn from us understanding that death is a tool for control for power for bombs for oil.  You can save their lives  but what thoughts do you put in their heads with your  wars and  Enrons.  My american dream is something much softer something more satisfying unique and undying It's not kids and a house in the 'burbs It's not riches and rides and bitches It's not total control of a wounded populace It's not that. none of that. But I can't tell you what it is because I don't know.   But still I say, you do what you want. You do it now Your personal freedom isn't a matter of dispute.  As long as you are not gay or female or a person of color or poor.  Have you taken drugs? You're off the list too. Your personal freedom Is on the line. Someone else is making the decisions, the big bucks And then hypocritically abusing every rule they've made.  But still, do what you want!  They say, damn the man.  Invent your all-purpose kitchen gizmo, write your pop song, go ahead even, write that book.  I'll read it.

       to do today   - wash car and remove rat nests from engine (poor ED is so dirty!)  (not any longer she's not!) - clean closets and drawers of things to donate  (an added plus: vacuumed floor!!) - transport pants/skirts/shorts etc. from broken drawers to new temporary plastic dresser  (am now wondering what to do with broken drawers) - clean bathroom (a definite 10 on the "ewww" factor right now)  -obtain large boxes from Ralphs for donation items -practice? (only a little) -celebrate mo'fuckin St Patty's day!!   Speaking of Ralphs, how did I miss that the grocery strike ended? No one told me!! Whatever, I'm still shopping at Henry's. The only reason I'll go to Ralphs now is probably for OJ, because Henry's...eh, not so hot.   Today's Recommended Listening: Dvorak String Quartet No 12 in F major. So pretty! It makes me wish I were a hearty peasant lass doing a jig with robust and handsome young Lars from the farm down the road. Lots of beer involved.   Time to get to work!

       it's a radiohead kind of day   The kind where you just lie on the floor, staring at the ceiling, while OK Computer is washing over you in thick electronic goodness. Skipping Fitter, Happier, of course.   I've also decided that, until they fall off me, I will not take off my rainbow pants. This is, understandably, not a reasonable option, as there are some situations (be it extreme heat, job interviews, or concert-dress settings) that require me to wear something else on my lower regions. I just want you to know that I won't be happy about it, because my rainbow pants kick ass and take names. Despite their sweatpants-esque material and waistband, they are bellbottomy and make my ass look hot. The rainbow stripes, of course, top off the whole ensemble. Forever I will hold Most Holy the day I bought them for under $10 at  urlLink Ragstock .   My desires to loll about in rainbow pants and awash my aural sensors in Radiohead (barring Kid A, because it always brings back shitty memories) are just side effects of my general "blah" feeling right now. "Blah" to just about everything, including my dirty car, my dirty bathroom, my clothes all over the floor, my trombone, reading books, surfing the internet, exercise, masturbation, and even, I am sorry to say, Buddha Stew. "Blah" to everything in this world except sleep and mind-numbing TV programs.   It is very sad that I feel burnt-out, because I really do nothing. Nothing at all, that requires me to be stressed, challenged intellectually, or otherwise bothered. Nothing. Just me, chilling. Blah.

       in/significance   here it is, this blank blogger page for me to full with words.   the thing is, i feel my head is just as muddled and uncertain as my life is, and i can't seem to find a place to start.   i'm not settling. i can't decide what i want to be when i grow up. if it were biologically possibly, i would be a tree, my aspiration at age 3.   being a tree would be fun. being an ent would be fucken rad. hroom hrroom!  the fact is, i can't be a tree. i have no inclination to be a doctor, lawyer, veterinarian, actor, scientist, or politician. a degree in music performance, trombone emphasis, suggests that maybe i should be a musician.   hm.   yeah i'm not so sure about that one, guys. kinda bumming on the whole musician thing.   i haven't practiced since i got back from canada. and i'm not missing it at all. if i had other source of income, i might not be going to coach at all. i'm a musical liability.   but what else would i do?   i can't get excited about any of the options america offers to me as a means of gainful employment.   but maybe i wouldn't mind being a lifeguard forever.  yeah, i could do that. maybe i'd graduate to head guard, and then aquatics supervisor.   everyone needs lifeguards. and hey, i'm good at it.   maybe better at it than anything else i do.   the broken sentences are coming at you fast and hard because i can't seem to keep a thought flowing in my head long enough to sponsor another one that deserves to be in the same sentence. i feel broken thoughts, thus, broken sentences.   i'm feeling down because it's the american dream, hammered into my head since childhood saying ambitions, horatio alger, 2.5 children, pursuit of happiness, that i can't accept. that i don't want the american dream. no kids or a house in the suburbs for me. i don't need loads and loads of money that i would feel compelled to give away. it's ambition i don't have. i'm not striving for anything.   except...  no, i do want happiness. contentment. peace.   what would be the consequences of me becoming a buddhist nun? i think i would enjoy it. much like being a tree, it suggests quietude, calmness, quiessence.   it's true, there are things i want to do. i experienced a bit of nostalgia for the music world today when thinking about pit orchestras (maybe not everyone's favorite memory), but i can't find it now.   it's a mood, it'll pass. all the good stuff, all the dreams and desires are buried under the doubts and anxieties. and the dullness most of all. it all comes from how sluggish, uninspired, and lonely i feel. not the "go-getter" i was, rather, my go's on the get. Just floatin' getting by. waiting for the stream to pick me up again and take me down the rapids. no excitement here. move along, folks.

       fahmer's mahket   Yesterday I had meant to go to the RB Farmer's Market to buy a bouquet of flowers for my mom and some of that delicious wonderful exquisite heavenly salsa (yes folks, it's that good). However, at 3 pm, when I actually remembered I had intended to go, it was too late. So, it being my mom's day off, I took her to the one in Poway, which worked out, as she paid for everything. The salsa lady was not there, unfortunately, but there was a hummus man. And he was cute. At least, I got some sort of culturally significant dipping sauce. I am content. We ended up with two bouquets-one of daffodils (my second favorite!) and the other an assorted mix of stargazer lilies (reminds me of Jerry, happy), roses, cosmos and daisies.   And...hallelujah...it's strawberry season. I am doing the Toyota jump right now- because I love what you do for me, strawberries.   Before we headed home we made a stop at a nursery to pick up some herbs so that I will not have to keep buying huge bunches of things like cilantro and parsley and having most of it go bad because I only need like one stalk of it. I feel very very very bad when that happens. Very. Thus, it would be more efficient and better for my general happiness if I started to grow herbs. We got two kinds of parsley, italian and the regular old tooth-cleaning kind, cilantro, thyme, rosemary, garlic cloves, sweet basil, and sweet marjoram (how do you say it? my mom says "marajam" but me, I learned to read phonetically so I'm doubtful of this). Dug up one of our side gardens and planted them with hopes that they will flourish and cheapen my weekly visits to Henry's. Huzzah!  Weekends kill me. Especially when I'm looking for a job and have to wait two whole days before I can pester managers again to hire me, meanwhile my bank account threatens to die of asphyxia. Holding out on the airlines to lower prices on flights to DC next month makes me nervous, but I'm giving it one more week...Davis, what's your decision? Today I'm meeting Cara, who commented back on my post about IWD hoping to have someone to travel with to the March. We're going to split the cost of a hotel, which is perfect. Speaking of which...time to wipe the garden dirt from my face and get spiffied up.

       what's in a name?   I've been toying with the idea of changing my AIM name. While llamas remain fascinating and cooler than most animals, I've outgrown that phase of my life (the obsession-that-defines-me-as-unique-and-special mentality) and it's time to change and reflect more who I've become.   Sure, it's just an IM name. But admittedly I have an ongoing quest for self-expression that requires me to put thought into the tags that describe me. Buddha Stew is a perfect name for my website and I couldn't be prouder of it (although what it has come to mean for me was unintentional in the beginning), but it's not really a description of me per se but of the things I put out into the world for mass consumption. The trick is to find a screenname that describes me, but yet doesn't limit my description to a narrow category, such as llamas.   [I predicted that raising this discussion with Jerry would lead to him suggesting a screenname for me that contained in some form the word "poopy." I know my Jerry. The following is a transcript of the pertinent aspect of our conversation: Llama721: thinking about maybe changing my IM name Skrtch4brkf: ooo Skrtch4brkf: to what Llama721: hmm Skrtch4brkf: pooperdoodoos  I rest my case.]  Before my present incarnation as Llama721, my screen name was the Les Miserables-inspired "Enjolrasse," a feminization of the character Enjolras, leader of the student revolutionaries. At the time I was mad about Les Miz, having seen in London on my 17th birthday. I spent a great deal of time on the official chat board making up fanfiction and being a general dork (however, I am grateful to my general dorkiness for making me a friend of  urlLink Hans  who retains his Les Miz screenname). I was one of those LM fans that scorned the tweenagers for their variations on Eponine nicknames and their numerous grammatically incorrect exploits into how much Cosette sucked, they loved Marius, and Eponine deserved him more. I, however, chose to be a little in love with Enjolras, but more so I wanted to be him, because I thought he was fuckin' rad. Hence, "Enjolrasse."  Now that I think about it, it still holds some significance. I'm all girl power human rights activist now, why not? Also, it lacks numbers, a plus.   Part of me is a little cautious about switching names just now though. I'm at a crossroads; I can't honestly say that I feel defined by my trombone as much as I used to, but I can't replace that drive with anything else just yet. I'm floating around in an eddy just waiting to join the stream again. So, do I forge ahead and remain Llama721, or backtrack and claim my Enjolrasse roots? How about an entirely new name, like bodhisattva or pooperdoodoos?   Feel free to vote on this important issue. Likely I'll think about, get distracted by something else, and forget about, thus solving my problem. Really, I only talk to...maybe five people out of 47 on a regular basis. Probably the same five people who read my webpage.

[Link via  urlLink The Republic of T ]  Also, I admired Gavin Newsome before but after reading  urlLink this article  in the  urlLink U-T  today he's my new hero. And he's got San Diego pegged, unfortunately:   Even if he was interested in replacing Feinstein some day, he says, that would mean seeking votes in more politically conservative areas such as San Diego County.   And right now, "I imagine in San Diego I may not be the most favored person."   Yeah, probably not. I love ya, Gavin!

       getcha thinking   Some insight into your head today at  urlLink Alas, a Blog . In brief, PinkDreamPoppies is exploring the ways we read and hear voices in our head corresponding to either knowing the gender of the speaker or making an assumption based on what is written. An example:   When most people read they hear the written words spoken in their minds. A disembodied vocal of authors, narrators, and characters fills their minds' ear acting out plays and essays, novels and poems. Blogs are composed with words and so are no exception to the rule, so chances are that you're hearing a voice right now.  Sometimes the voices that readers hear are the voices of actual people. Mothers speak with familiar tones in letters to their children, and stories traded between friends are still heard as though over the phone even if read alone in silence. Some actors, even, can take over a character so that no matter what voice readers may have heard before they cannot help but hear the actor's now. How many Harry Potter fans will always hear Alan Rickman when they read Severus Snape? How long with Lawrence Olivier be Hamlet?  Usually, though, the voices people hear are new, unique, and private. Each reader hears his or her own version of a character's voice that is created from the reader's perception of the character's gender, age, race, ethnicity, personality, history, and personal appearance and how these things interact to create a whole person. These perceptions on the part of the reader can be the difference between a sympathetic character and one the reader hopes gets side-swiped by a bus. Everyone bring prejudices to the table while reading; people will inflict their views of blacks and whites and Hispanics or men and women or the rich and the poor on the characters.  Honestly, this has really got me thinking. It's made me focus on how I read and understand what's in front of me, and I'm still a little baffled as to how I hear things in my head.   I'd like to think I read, regardless of gender, pretty fairly and giving the author the benefit of the doubt. Since I commented on the post in question, I've changed my mind. There, I said that I was consciously aware of how I interpreted the other commenters based on the apparent gender of their name. In retrospect, I've discovered it takes a genuine effort for me to truly hear a gendered voice in my head; even when reading someone whose speaking voice I am accustomed to, such as Jerry, I have a hard time imagining his voice to go along with it. It is not that I can't remember the sound of his voice, but rather that the two, his writing style and his speaking style, are disconnected in my brain. I can bring to mind something Jerry has said to me and hear it in his voice, but it is not so with his writing. On IM, when speaking to a close friend, the same is true, although it's easier to bring their voices to mind. It might have something to do with the person: Jason's voice I can easily bring to mind, and Sheena's, but with Val I have a harder time. This is arbitrary, I'm not sure why it works that way.   In any case I think I might be a bit of an exception to the rule. Since learning to read, I can't remember a time when I didn't have a book in hand, and my early social development was slow and rather intellectual. This didn't always go over well with girls and boys my age, and as a consequence I became less sure of my social ability, retired to my books, bam, vicious cycle. Even today, when I have become more sure of myself and my speaking abilities, I have trouble relating or carrying on a conversation with people whose social development has focused more on vocal communication.   But, I can't deny that knowing the gender, race, or sexual orientation of an author will affect my perception of that person. Fortunately, I've developed a modicum of fairness in my own thoughts in regards to race and gender and so on to not so much as  judge  said person for their background as look at them as having a unique perspective on the matter at hand. This has taken loads of work, overcoming whatever socialization I've had about blacks, hispanics, gay men, literary women, etc., to the point where I definitely favor and agree more with, say, a black woman talking about the effects of racism than a white, scholarly type (man or woman) using the same topic. Of course, that's to say that experience is just as valid, or more so, than research and statistics.   As far as reading a novel goes, unless the author gives a detailed description of the character I have to build scenery and appearance in my own mind before I can give that person a voice. For me, it always starts with the visual and then goes to the aural. This might tie into my struggles with ear training and playing by ear in music; unless I can see it and play with it visually, I have trouble immediately recognizing certain pitches and so on. Not to say that I can't learn to do these things-I have some varied history of actually being  good  at sightsinging or dictation, but these occurred when I was actively working and concentrating almost solely on aural skills. I think that's why I did so poorly in theory- I had a hard time switching back and forth between the analytical and intellectual aspects of Hyer (bleh) and the brief episodes of ear training that were thrown inbetween without a firm aural base to begin with. Which just goes to show you, I'm no good at multi-tasking mentally. Can't be sitting here blogging all day either, and then expect to do math with any kind of accuracy. Blog everything in my head when I don't have a social life of any equal measure to the time I spend on the internet. Nerd.  Hmm, I realize that PDP's post was much more thought-provoking and all. It's more of a stream-of-consciousness here. Said in my head, of course, in my own beautiful voice which I realize sounds nothing at all like my actual speaking voice. Which when played back for me, is annoying and squeaky. Naturally, everyone hates their own voice, yeah? You never sound like you really want to. But that's a post for another time.

       bodhicitta on the brain   In a recent post, I got a little angry and frustrated with our (p)Resident. Davis, rightly, pointed out that it's easy to use one person as a scapegoat when they might represent the views of many people who are equally ignorant. Nevertheless, these people have a say in governmental policies and their representative owes it to them to understand their ideas.   The past couple of days, I have been examining my anger toward Bush and how it fits in with my buddhist leanings. The idea of bodhicitta, the ultimate in compassion, the very essence of which is needed to attain perfect buddhahood, has come to my mind frequently. With bodhicitta, a bodhisattva (one who is destined to become a Buddha) must look at the world and wish not to achieve enlightenment for his or her own sake, but for the cessation of suffering of all people. The first step to attaining this calling is to begin to see all beings as having been one's mother.   In a buddhist world, we have more past lives than there are grains of sand in the Ganges. Thus, when we look at the people in our lives, hell, even the ants and birds and lemurs, we see souls that have been any myriad of things, the mother of our then-incarnation included. A mother is the ultimate in kindness and unselfishness, and therefore we must love everyone as we love our mother. [Let's ignore for the time being this idealization of motherhood and save the feminist analysis for another time. In cases where one has not known the kindness of a mother, one is encouraged to bring to mind a being who has in some way shown them great compassion and love.]  Simple enough. The trick is in the remaining six steps to Buddhahood. Second, you must find within yourself the urge to repay this kindness your "mother" has bestowed upon you, which is followed by the intense feeling of love, a desire to make that person happy. Happiness, it follows, is freedom from suffering and thus in the fourth step you develop compassion for your subjects. If you have compassion for all beings, you have "intense intention" which leads to bodhicitta, the awakening mind. Step up on up to be the next Buddha. It's all you, baby.   Professor Dunne would share the following story to describe to us the essence of bodhicitta:   The monk Asanga was traveling one day when he came across a worm-ridden dog, still alive, lying on the roadside. Feeling intense compassion for the plight of this dog, he carefully removed the worms and cared for the dog's wounds. As he was doing so, he realized that he must care for the worms as well, whose sustenance had just been removed from them. Therefore, he took a knife and cut from his leg a long strip of flesh and placed the maggots on it so they could eat.   In fact, the dog was a form of the bodhisattva Maitreya, who was putting this challenge to Asanga to demonstrate compassion. Buddhists teachers, the Dalai Lama included, teach that one seeking compassion should treasure those in our lives who make things difficult, because without this struggle we would not truly begin to see all beings with equanimity and love. In other words, it's easy enough to be kind and helpful if everyone you meet is a peach to live with. It is the true troublemakers that will help us attain bodhicitta.   Thus, it is my challenge to find compassion for the people in my life who aggravate me. My father, for one. Is he a bodhisattva in disguise, urging me to find the wellspring of love I desire? Bush, for another, which is hard and complicated, because in his own right he is harming many people. From today's  Daily Wisdom  by the Dalai Lama:   According to the Latin root of the word, "religion" would mean "to bind again." Now how does the concept of binding or tying up come to be applied as the common term for all our various teachings?   The common enemy of all religious disciplines, the target of all moral precepts laid down by the great teachers of mankind, is selfishness of mind. For it is just this which causes ignorance, anger, and passion--which are at the root of all the troubles of the world."  My attraction for buddhism comes from this simple idea of compassion and the cessation of suffering for all people. If one understands it properly, it is impossible to make an action that is founded on what one sees is best or most fit for other people. Instead, one looks at the consequences of suffering in situations as drastic as war or embargo, as sweeping as intolerance and ignorance, and as mundane as gossip or backstabbing. Thus, Bush's actions are to me rooted in great selfishness parading as unselfishness, the most dangerous kind. I would love to see him awakened and enlightened as to the nature of suffering, surrounding by buddhist monks filled with love and energy. For now, I must work on seeing him as my mother.

       your afternoon assignment   If you want a taste of some truly disturbing right-wing thinking, take a look at  urlLink this column , via  urlLink Feministe . (Also, it appears that Ms Lauren has been invaded by a particularly hateful little man with a Dixieland band. Neat.) If you can get through the Card column, I salute you, and will bake you a cake of your choosing (I get to have some, because I sat through it too).   If I were to thoroughly critique this particular piece of shit, it would take me days. Therefore, I am just going to make fun of it.   This quote is fun, because it's so sad:  In the first place, no law in any state in the United States now or ever has forbidden homosexuals to marry. The law has never asked that a man prove his heterosexuality in order to marry a woman, or a woman hers in order to marry a man.   Any homosexual man who can persuade a woman to take him as her husband can avail himself of all the rights of husbandhood under the law. And, in fact, many homosexual men have done precisely that, without any legal prejudice at all.   Yes! Finally, someone who understands that obviously it's not the  person  you're marrying that's important, but rather the very act of getting married and reaping the tax benefits.   I would like to see some hard evidence for this:   And yet, throughout the history of human society -- even in societies that tolerated relatively open homosexuality at some stages of life -- it was always expected that children would be born into and raised by families consisting of a father and mother.   Somehow I think that can be refuted.  God Forbid!:  We also expect our spouse to behave, as a parent, in the way we have learned to expect from the experiences we had with our opposite-sex parent -- that's why so many men seem to marry women just like their mother, and so many women to marry men just like their father. It takes conscious effort to break away from this pattern.  Were I to marry a man like my father (in fact if I were to marry at all!) I would probably commit suicide. One Ed Husting in my life is plenty, thanks.   Also, Mr Card (and he is a card, ain't he?), while acknowledging that some societal factors go in to our current standard of gender roles, is very keen on biological essentialism to make his point. Behold! The ever useful "Men can't keep their pants on and must spread their seed amongst many nubile females, who choose them for their relative strength and ability to provide meat and fire. Grunt Ugh!":  Civilization requires the suppression of natural impulses that would break down the social order. Civilization thrives only when most members can be persuaded to behave unnaturally, and when those who don't follow the rules are censured in a meaningful way.   Why would men submit to rules that deprive them of the chance to satisfy their natural desire to mate with every attractive female?   Why would women submit to rules that keep them from trying to mate with the strongest (richest, most physically imposing, etc.) male, just because he already has a wife?   And What Will Happen, Prophet Orson, If We Let Our Children Grow Up Without Homophobia?:   Already any child with any kind of sexual attraction to the same sex is told that this is an irresistible destiny, despite the large number of heterosexuals who move through this adolescent phase and never look back.   Already any child with androgynous appearance or mannerisms -- effeminate boys and masculine girls -- are being nurtured and guided (or taunted and abused) into "accepting" what many of them never suspected they had -- a desire to permanently move into homosexual society.   In other words, society will bend all its efforts to seize upon any hint of homosexuality in our young people and encourage it.  Seriously folks. Are we so adjusted to the idea that there always has to be a dominant pressure, a societal push, whether it be male superiority or spread the good gay gospel, that we can't see a world without such oppressive boundaries? It's the same kind of argument that leads people to believe that feminists seeking to change the reality of patriarchy are going for the reverse, a female-dominant society.   More hard evidence, please:   The dark secret of homosexual society -- the one that dares not speak its name -- is how many homosexuals first entered into that world through a disturbing seduction or rape or molestation or abuse, and how many of them yearn to get out of the homosexual community and live normally.  Finally, all this talk about "activist judges." What the crap? Um, yeah, they have the power to decide what is constitutional and fair under the law. They were elected or appointed. So were the men and women in Congress, and our President (although it remains open to debate). When I make a fuss about how Bush is not representing  my  interests and those of the people around me that share my feelings, I'm unpatriotic and a bleeding heart. I protested the war in Iraq. I seethed when Bush made his "I can't be swayed by a special interest group" comment. So, I guess I can understand why some opponents of same sex marriage feel they've been taken advantage of by the actions of the Massachusetts court. However, they in fact were acting with people in mind, with people's right to the pursuit of happiness and so forth. In my opinion Bush led us into a war we had no business even thinking about, and sent Americans to fight it. Whose interests are really being represented here? I ask you this.   Ready for that cake? I might as well learn to make one in training for my natural role as a wife and mother. After all, I plan to have a traditional, God-fearing, heterosexual marriage just like my parents, because they've been such good role models.  [A Final Note: You can also laugh at Orson, because on top of being silly and misguided, he can't spell, either. Two of the three genuinely mispelled words in my post came from his quotes. Tee hee. I win! ;)]

       who is bored?   i am. and sleepy, because of my 8 AM coaching session for which I awoke at 6:30. I had one of those nights again (actually, it's almost every night), where i'm super tired but falling asleep escapes me. I tossed, turned, and thought blank thoughts, but it took a while. Thus, sleepy today. It is, of course, a beautiful day and I have the option of going swimming or perhaps for an afternoon bike ride, but the sleepy is discouraging me from this. I think perhaps I will go swimming when I am done here, or at least go to the pool and fall asleep in a chair.   I didn't want to jinx it by blogging about it, but it appears I have jinxed it by NOT blogging about it. I'm waiting on a call about a lifeguarding job, at the community pool where us nautical RB Broncos had our swim practices and home meets, and a year later where I worked for the summer as a swim instructor for the little rodents of suburban families. Rick the Dick, thankfully, is no longer the pool manager there. I sauntered over last week to see if they needed lifeguards or at least just get my name in and have an ap on file. It appears that they do, actually, need guards, so lucky me. However. The man has not called me back, and he said he would do so before this past weekend. Should it happen that he does not call during the remainder of today's business hours, I will call him first thing tomorrow.   Getting anxious to hear from Michigan and McGill, and also to find out what egg-sac-tly is up with T-Mobile not getting my last phone bill payment. Grr. I now owe them for two months, but I paid before I left, I swear! Damn you, postal service!!  Muriel Spark is a very funny author. Evidence to such:   "He looked as if he would murder me, and he did." -from "The Portobello Road"  and  "As a provisional measure, I worked it out that either he was mad or that he was not mad." -from "The Playhouse called Remarkable"  Brilliant!

       blogging has been light today...   but jilling off has reached an all-time high. Seriously. I am horny. Damn. Spring fever like crazy. All I want to do is go out, dance, drink, and go home with some lucky chick. I might take a guy if I'm desperate, or if said man bears a resemblance to Benecio del Toro or Edward Norton. However. Girl is on my mind.    Another part of me is saying, in ever-so-soft a voice (mostly drowned out by the extreme randiness), that the spring weather would be a perfect time for those warm-fuzzies, heightened-heart-rate, spine-tingling crush/romance moments. Sitting on the porch swing in the moonlight feeling the anticipation in the air. First tenative kisses. Lying in bed (after the randiness has been momentarily dispelled) with legs intertwined and listening to crickets chirp outside.   It's been a while since I've had a crush. Well, two years! Although most (if not all) of my crushes have been tainted with the fear of rejection and insecurity, I feel my recent desire for the physical and emotional effects of crush-mentality, coupled with its concurrent horniness, could be an effective recipe for a non-holds-barred flirtation, with none of the nasty unrequited love side effects. I also feel that since I seldom feel so sexually-inspired I should run with it and make good use of it while it lasts. Before it runs out and I return to my regularly scheduled low-sex-drive program.   I swear it's the weather. I'm going crazy, but it's definitely fun. I'm currently taking applications for persons willing to party rockstar-style with me this weekend. You will all be accepted. Unless you don't live in San Diego, in which case you are lame and should come visit me so we can seek the hot lesbian sex out as a team.   Note: It will be interesting to see how many new visitors I will get because of this entry. Bring 'em on, Google.

       HAPPY INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY!   March is Women's History Month and today, March 8th, is  urlLink International Women's Day . It has meant a myriad of things throughout its 93 year history, from an event for socialist causes to strikes and marches for peace and women's rights.   A holiday is what you make of it, so take a little time to celebrate IWD in the way you see fit. Champion a woman in your life for her achievements. Write a letter to your congressperson asking for the resuscitation of the Equal Rights Amendment. Protest a violent or misogynistic ad on TV. Buy something woman-friendly; a magazine (no, not Cosmo or Seventeen.  urlLink Bitch  or  urlLink Bust !), any Ani Difranco, Dar Williams, or Tori Amos CD, a book by a woman author (but stay away from Ann Coulter or Laura Schlesinger...for as much as women's liberation has allowed them to shine and succeed they sure are bitter). Make a button. Sign up to go to the  urlLink March  in April.  I haven't decided yet what I will do today. I coach at noon, would it be risky to wear my Save Roe (a hanger with a slash through it) button to a high school? Perhaps today is my day to officially declare that I will be in DC next month, with Marisa, Jerry, hopefully Davis, and 3000 other people fighting for women's rights.   Whatever you do, let me know about it!

       hanging out in the wet swimsuit, for old times' sake   I had a very good Sunday, and it's only going to get better.   I woke up bright and early (it seems to be a recent trend-haven't slept past 9:30 at all since I got back from Montreal), bummed around, did some yoga, and made a cheese sandwich, which was delicately placed in a baggy and packed, along with waterbottle and book, into my backpack. Got my act together and went for a hike. Los Penasquitos is quickly becoming my favorite place to go...it's quiet and not that many people hike there, the stream and waterfall provide some great scenery, and it's not uphill or anything (hurray!). Since I've been there last (Jan, with Jerry), spring has steadily begun to take over and it's a different place already. Three cheers for nature.   I didn't make it all the way to the waterfall this time; I decided to stop at the shady glen about two miles in and eat my sammich and let my feet frolic in the stream. It was hot, and my leg was cramping a little, so it's all for the best. Plus, the waterfall was likely a popular spot and not many people can find the shady glen.   While I was there I started to wish I had a picture phone and a moblog, like  urlLink Shaun , so I could share the nature lovin' with you. Actually, his two most recent pictures appear to have been taken in a similar area to Los Penasquitos...eh? Weird. I saw two woodpeckers and a heron.   Also, I couldn't stop thinking that the shady glen would be a good place to make out with someone. Man, I'm so randy lately. All I can think about it sex. On my way back I was passed by a girl on a bike who gave me the most gorgeous smile. Swoon. Later, a pleasantly scruffy gentleman also on bicycle made eye contact with me for a few seconds and I had to restrain myself from knocking him off his bike and dragging him off into the underbrush for some nookie. Daaaayamn he was fine.   I made it back to my car with out assaulting anyone. ;) Went to the pool to cool off, and now I'm home for what promises to be a super evening. My parents have just left for dinner, which means I have the rare opportunity of an  evening  alone, sooo nice. I am going to make the Tunisian vegetable stew from my Moosewood cookbook, and listen to Jeff Buckley. And tonight it's just sweet, sweet Adult Swim and some Thin Mints. Ooh baby.

       hypocrisy part deux   Today is a 100 on the Wisconsin Frisbee Index.   This means I woke up, looked outside, and thousands of little bells in my head went off, triggering an irresistible urge to frolic outside. The WFI runs on a scale of 0-100 (0 being bone-shattering wind conditions and slushy ice rain), influenced by such factors as sunshine, sky hue, and relative previous weather conditions affecting ability to frolic outside (read: spring fever). Thus, a mildly brisk, partly cloudy day can trigger a high WFI simply because it occurs after months of slogging through snow and slush wearing every piece of clothing you own. It could be 50 F. You can calculate the WFI most effectively by counting the number of students who are tossing a frisbee, lounging on the half-dead grass of Bascom Hill, or just generally skipping class while enjoying an iced beverage at an outdoor cafe. Someone will open their dorm window and blast Dave Matthews out of it. This indicates an especially high WFI; only nudged farther up if the music in question is Bob Marley.   Thus, although I have spent the majority of "winter" in mild, usually sunny climes, my personal WFI has reached an all time high. It is a combination of spending a recent amount of time in the Midwest, watching the transition from winter to spring begin, being holed up with my parents and no job/friends for several months, wanting to get more physical exercise in the form of frolicking, and a very specific knack for knowing just exactly what the difference is between one San Diego day and the next. Most people are baffled by this, but when you live here, you  know . Perhaps it's a general brightness to the colors and sounds. A warmer breeze. Whatever it is, it's subtle but its message is clear:   IT'S SPRING!!   Side effects of my high WFI include:  -horniness -parading about in skimpy bathing suit -dusting off Sublime CDs (I just can't listen to them in good conscience in winter) -girly clothing -painting toenails  Yes, I am preparing myself for the mating ritual that spring is. I can't deny it, it's an age-old, instinctual tradition. Time to get my groove on. Tap that ass. Shake what my momma gave me.   Sweeeeet.

       hypocrisy   Everything about the weather today says: It's Friday, the weekend, go to the beach, take a hike, smell the flowers. Even I, in my pathetic non-week-vs.-weekend based existence, am excited. The weather says, citizens of San Diego, I dearly love you,  urlLink here  is a beautiful weekend for you to play outside. I wish I could show it to you. I know most of you would kill me, or fly out immediately to visit (the latter is preferred). Despite what weather.com says, there are no clouds. It's at least 70. It's all I can do right now to resist donning my bathing suit and heading to the pool (I assure you, I will as soon as I am done here) without delay.   And. The big one. And...the flowers are blooming. It's spring. The pink jasmine have arrived, which couldn't make me happier. Pink jasmine is my absolute favorite smell in the whole wide world. It's right here, in my own backyard. It's fabu. Other flowers that are blooming include iceplant (swathes of orange, red, and purple adorning the highways and hillsides) and daisies (yellow fields and lawns!). It's only the beginning. In the next two weeks, everything will be crazy and chaotic with color.  The hypocrisy of my post lies thus: In spite of my distaste for my city's politics, suburban sprawl, and traffic-riddled streets, you can't beat the weather. You just can't. Maybe tie it, or come in a close second...but you can't beat it. Hands down the best weather ever.   Days like today make it hard to think of leaving. Days like today I can forget that I'm stuck behind 20 cars at a red light because I'm singing Ani songs at the top of my lungs with the windows down and my besandaled feet tapping. Days like today I remember why I hate being a lifeguard anywhere else. Days like today you can't help being young, and hopeful, and free. Days like today...you'll find me at the pool.   See ya there.

       do you ever get the feeling...   that your parents are making fun of you? And not just poking harmless, well-meant fun, but rather nasty, jive-ass, ignorant remarks?  I do.   It has been evidenced to me in the following ways (and yes, I know well enough the adage "an eavesdropper nevers hears anything good about himself"):  The "Lauren's an ignorant Gen-Xer" comment:  Scenario-I at computer, looking at one my daily reads (was it  urlLink Buzzflash?  or even  urlLink Margaret? . Not to toot my own horn, it could just have easily been  urlLink The Onion ), I overhear my parents having a discussion about the questionable intelligence of one younger "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" contestant, who is unsure about the location of Harley Davidson. They are mocking her "because everyone knows this" and not just baby boomers from the greater eastern Wisconsin area. She "watches MTV instead of the news, and doesn't know anything about America. All these kids these days [a little too cliche for my taste perhaps]. Look at Lauren-all she reads in the newspaper are cartoons."   Ahem.   I shall not refute that; tis true! I ignore the heavier sections of the paper for the funnies, and on a rare occasion have been noted to skim the day's headlines. I stopped getting my news from mass media sources not long ago, what with the inferiority of TV and the loss of the Chicago Tribune at my breakfast table. The time I spend on the internet is a mixture of catching up the VERY intelligent blogs I read daily and following up on the stories they report.   Regardless of what I actually do on the internet, my father's offhand comment is merely the tip of their big ol' denial iceberg of my politics and social consciousness. It has been recorded in the past. They do not want to hear my "liberal whining" or at best, maintain that "I'll grow out of it once I leave that bleeding heart activist factory." I will be the first to admit that politics will change, and should change, evolving with your interests and needs. However. I wave my private parts at their aunties. Bah.  Scenario 2: Ah fuck it.  I really want to bitch about how my dad's an overbearing, sexist, opinionated, wino ass clown.   Disclaimer: I hold the utmost respect for the ideals my father raised me with (to be strong, confident, smart, and not to take shit), through teaching me to wrestle, requiring I perform feats of mathematical agility without exception...well, the confident he led by example? And the not to take shit? Well,  he  didn't. Guess he's a good role model, albeit a strict one.   He doesn't listen. He gives my mom a second shift of dishes, cooking, vacuuming, etc, but wants endless praise or assistance for the chores he undertakes (today, he did dishes with much aplomb: big sigh, clatter clatter, groan, clatter clatter-in Husting language that translates to: "I hate what I'm doing because I'm missing this episode of Perry Mason I've already seen, I should be sitting in my chair while LAUREN (girl) doesn't the dishes, let's slam these plates together to show my disgust for housework"). Should my mom or I be doing chores and create any sort of disturbance, we are evil satanic bitches. We get glared at. My dad's glare is something I have learned to handle. We end up having staring contests. It's where I learned to raise one eyebrow and look amused yet not-shit-taking.   He loves to have things his way (heck, don't we all?). Should you thank him kindly for his suggestion but not use it, infidel! Ingrate! Should you refute his logic or attempt a friendly banter, bitch! Ingrate! (I get a lot of that one around here) Poor Chipper, who has but a breath left in his tortured body, gets the worst rap, worse than I even. Beware, you are not immune. Jerry has stories. My friends have stories.  And were I my mother (perhaps it's a good thing I am not), I would have snapped long ago. It wouldn't have accomplished anything. My father has an Autobahn-sized stubborn streak. It is ALWAYS your fault. Nothing makes me feel more stuck in the past, teenager style, unable to grow up and realize my life, than this. I have a college degree, for fuck's sake.  I may not get into Michigan or McGill, but hell if I'm staying here another year. Another six months even. Fuck that shit. Heads would roll, Lizzie Borden style. I'd be on your evening news. But I'd probably be smiling.

       right on, woman. now step up, men   I'd like to point y'all over to  urlLink Ms Lauren's particularly lucid discussion on rape and rape culture  today, and especially encourage my male readership to pay close attention. This is for you, boys, you're responsible today whether you like it or not.   I'll wait.  Oh, you're back? Okay,  now  it's my turn.  Her points are all valid, and well-made, thus I don't feel like I can accurately reproduce them here. In my life I have been incredibly lucky to escape any major incidents of sexual assault or abuse. I say lucky, because  urlLink many women have not been.  1 in 5, and that report is from 1996. Add to that the fact that many women do not feel comfortable reporting a sexual crime in our culture's atmosphere of blame and responsibility centered on women. Because I have not been subjected to sexual assault (besides the ever-annoying catcalls and the like) and the statistic is so high, I am on guard when I find myself in certain situations. I take pride in being strong and healthy, therefore in some ways equipped to resist a potential attacker. I could further my confidence by taking self-defense or carrying mace or a weapon (self-defense would be more likely, in my case). But, as Ms Lauren points out, rape culture is not only a "woman's issue." I would like to see the numbers on that statistics sheet reversed, to show how many  men  commit sexual assault or rape. The onus is on men, in that case, to stop seeing women as victims but men as victimizers. There's a difference. A victim can play the card, or recover and become a survivor, but it was not his or her choice to become a victim, regardless of his or her behavior, dress, or physical location. Important to note here is that  urlLink men are victims of sexual violence as well  but that perpetrators are  urlLink almost always men . [both links via  urlLink Feministe ]  It's the little things that make rape culture less powerful. Not laughing at a violent (toward women or gay men) or homophobic joke, and making a point that it is not funny, is one small way. Using language that places responsibility where it belongs is another, such as saying "men rape" rather than "a woman was raped." It means understanding more fully what's happening with both the  urlLink University of Colorado  and the  urlLink Kobe Bryant case . It means learning to see women as people, not sexual objects. Protesting violent ads or movies (I learned from  Cunt  that 1 in 8 major Hollywood movies has a rape scene. Most of them are eroticized.), is as simple as not giving your money to these institutions. If you know a man who disrespects women (or gay men, or even "effeminate" straight men) in a sexual or violent way, socially boycott him. Let him know his behavior has cost your friendship.   And please, never never never EVER say  urlLink shit  like this:   There is a connection between the increasing disrespect shown to women in our society and an ultra-feminist ideology that pushes teenage girls to play a brutal contact sport with teenage boys.   A boy on a coed football squad -- or playing against a coed squad -- faces an irreconcilable conflict between his duty as a man and his duty as a player. As a man, he must never strike a woman. As a player he must strike teammates during scrimmages, and opposing players during games, fairly and within the rules but with all the force he can muster.   [...]To do that safely, she has to practice hitting and being hit. For a boy to play football with a girl, the boy must become habituated to hitting girls.   That is not merely un-American, but uncivilized. There are many endeavors where men and women rightfully compete on the same playing field (I'd pick Margaret Thatcher to run Great Britain over Tony Blair any day), but the football field is not one of them. American schools should ban girls from playing football, and do it now.   Excuse me, but that makes ME feel violent. Rat bastard.

       thunderstorm thunderstorm!!!!   hurray! Nothing I love more in the world than a thunderstorm, and in southern CA we don't get them very often. I'm excited because it's probably the best thing that's happened to me today (two rejection letters, being told I couldn't vote in the presidential primaries because I'm registered non-partisan and didn't know to request a ballot).   I got some more books at the library, although I have yet to finish  Body Outlaws  and  The Blind Assassin . Err...gonna go easy on the trombone playing, I guess. :)   All of these books were recommended reading and/or an integral part of the book  Reading Lolita in Tehran  by Azar Nafisi, which is invaluable for its insights into classics of Western literature (Lolita, Gatsby, Pride and Prejudice) from the viewpoint of a different culture and system of oppressions. The books I checked out are:    Baghdad Diaries: A Woman's Chronicle of War and Exile  by Nuha al-Radi  The Stone Diaries  by Carol Shields Short Stories by Muriel Spark  More Die of Heartbreak  by Saul Bellow  Speaking of Lolita, you can mosey on over to  urlLink Feministe  and take a "What Classic Novel Am I" quiz. I was  Lolita . Before I read Nafisi's book, I would have been a little freaked out. But she takes it to a new level...not to be taken so literally as a tale about child sexual abuse but as an allegory for the abuse of persons by an oppressive government such as the Soviet Union or the Islamic Republic of Iran.   The other funny thing is, Lolita is a version of what my cousin used to call me, "Little Lo." Dude.

       rejection letters. weeeee!!!   I'm home. And it's anticlimatic. I've already been rejected from two schools.  One of them was DePaul.   I want to go there most of all.  Shitty.   I'm not terribly heartbroken or anything, although that audition did go the best of the four...and it's Chicago and it's Mark Fisher and everything else wonderful. ASU is the other rejection, which I'm not surprised about. So that leaves Michigan and McGill, and...  So, I'm prepared to start fielding ideas about what I should do with my second year off. New York with Jerry? Dallas with Chris? Someplace totally random, like Fuji, and never play my trombone again?   Fuck.

       here's another one   By  urlLink John Keats  (how could I forget the poem that graces the door to my room?):    When I have fears that I may cease to be      Before my pen has gleaned my teaming brain, Before high-piled books, in charactery,      Hold like rich garners the full ripened grain; When I behold, upon the night's starred face,      Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance, And think that I may never live to trace      Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance; And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,      That I shall never look upon thee more, Never have relish in the fairy power      Of unreflecting love--then on the shore Of the wide world I stand alone, and think Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.

       today is a special day!   It's  urlLink Poem on Your Blog Day! . Inspired by  urlLink Ms Lauren's  steady stream of poetic posts, I will post for you one of my favorites. If you're lucky, I might even write one, later. After I finished editing that story I wrote, for  urlLink Hans . Or before. I dunno. Anyway.   I have a penchant for beat poetry and spontaneous prose, thus I line my shelves with Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac and others, and I try to suppress my eternal desire to just let go of everything and travel, let the wind or I-Ching take me whichever way it pleases into experiences I can only dream about in upper-middle class suburban America. To be both an observer of the people living their lives normally, existing within the system, and an active participant in the communities of individuals making their own society (but without the junk habit). I present to you a poem by  urlLink Ginsberg  that never fails to raise an unholy and joyous giggle in my soul.    A Supermarket in California       What thoughts I have you tonight, Walt Whitman, for I walked down the sidestreets under the trees with a headache self-conscious looking at the full moon.       In my hungry fatigue, and shopping for images, I went into the neon fruit supermarket, dreaming of your enumerations!      What peaches and what penumbras! Whole families shopping at night! Aisles full of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the tomatoes!--and you, Garcia Lorca, what where you doing down by the watermelons?       I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.      I heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops? What price bananas? Are you my Angel?      I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, and followed in my imagination by the store detective.       We strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier.        Where are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Which way does your beard point tonight?      (I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd.)      Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade to shade, lights out in the houses, we'll both be lonely.       Will we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles in driveways, home to our silent cottage?      Ah, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, what America did you have when Charon quite poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking bank and stood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of the Lethe?

       kickin' off sexism, tyne daly style   In an effort to make sure I remember and detail everything about this past weekend, I'm going to have a series of blogs on my different experiences. You'll have to bear with me as I have lots more to talk about. :)   Saturday night, Cara and I went to the Official March Kickoff, at the DC Armory. It was like one big variety show- hosted by the band  urlLink Betty .  I can't remember everyone that spoke, but a lot of big feminist names were there- Tyne Daly, Ellie Smeal, Gloria Feldt (whose book,  urlLink The War on Choice  I happened to be reading), okay, I'm totally drawing a blank. I took some pictures- we were fairly close to the stage. Kathy Najimy flashed us, but she had her bra on. Elizabeth from BETTY didn't, and her boobs said "Pro" and "Choice" respectively. I think that might be the first time I've been flashed. Rockin'. This chick,  urlLink SONiA , rocks my socks. Imma getting a CD of hers when I get my paycheck. Oh yeah, we sang a song called "Every Sperm Does Not Deserve a Name" ("if so a man would found a nation every time he came") which still has me giggling. Also, the March For Women's Lives song (of the same title) by  urlLink Judy Gorman  is stuck in my head on constant loop today.  urlLink Cris Williamson  is rad.   Before all the festivities started, we wandered around the booths and checked out the merchandise. I got  urlLink this t-shirt  (except mine has rockin' hot pink lettering), and one of the offical march tees. Also, a button. I was torn between two other tshirts (one said "Wax Bush 2004" and the other "There's only one good Bush"), but I ended up getting neither. We got our official NOW "Keep Abortion Legal" signs (they had a tragic end...more on that later), and an older lady gave me her balloons off her table (they were blocking her view of the stage). One woman had a shirt on that said "I love Pro-Choice boys"--rock on. Lots of those at the march, one even holding a sign that said "Pro-choice and single"; he got lots of cheers. I thought it would be cool to have a make-out for choice, or a sex-in for choice or something. Heehehe.   Anyway, the kickoff. Good times. Afterward I got in touch with Marisa and we metroed over to her hotel, but she and Dennis were hell-bent on drinking, so we didn't talk long. I was hoping the cute and maybe lesbian girl who we talked to from the parking lot of our hotel would be up and around when we got back, but it was late, alas, and we were tired.   Speaking of tired... That's all you get for tonight. Tomorrow's installment will be the details of the March itself, including the anti-choicers and the rally. I have one picture left to take on my camera- likely I will quick snap a pic of Chipper tomorrow and have them for your disposable tomorrow evening.

       letter to the editor of the san diego tribune, 4/27/2004   Thank you for your story about the march on Washington that occurred this past Sunday, April 25th. I thought you might like to hear some reflections on the day from a pro-choice San Diegan who attended.   First of all, I spent the greater part of the morning meeting and making new friends among the San Diego attendees- almost 500 by their count! San Diego should be proud to know that so many people from our city were participating in democracy and speaking up for our reproductive rights.   It bothers me a little that the march was constantly referred to as an "abortion rights" rally, although I know that was the focus of the day, and is sadly the way it is often spun to polarize the issue into black and white. However, this march was about much more than just abortion. Attendees were rallying for more comprehensive sex education, access to over the counter emergency contraception, safer and healthier birth control, and more comprehensive health care that would benefit women and children. Internationally, the US's policies regarding family planning have been distastrous and will only serve to send third-world countries further into the depths of disease and poverty. Access to abortion is but one part of it, and if we could, as a country, improve our positions on these other issues it would in fact reduce the necessity for abortion. Not one of the marchers wants a woman to have to make a choice to end a pregnancy, but it remains a much-need option in cases of ill health, poverty, or tragedy. Dialogue that has created personhood rights for fetus causes harm and undue burden on women, putting them under extreme pressure from the law in a society that already dictates physical and social standards. Religious arguments against abortion are valid, and should be heard, but they have no place in the law of this country.   This march is the biggest of its kind, perhaps of any kind, in the history of the US. March organizers put the estimate at 1.15 million. There was a lot of anger, and demonstration on the part of the marchers, but overall the spirit of sisterhood, of fighting for a worthy cause, was the main feeling of the day. Anywhere you looked, people were smiling, laughing, and making friends and marching companions. The relief at being in a safe place away from the realities of sexism and racism was unbelievable- coming back on the plane I felt the burden tenfold but was stronger for what I had experienced.   Regardless of how one feels about reproductive rights, it is important in these times to reject imposition of religious ideologies that block and taint true, factual scientific evidence about our sexuality and reproductive capacities. We are a country that promises both freedom of religion and freedom from religion, and that's what the march was all about. Many people are concerned about the activities of our current president, and would like to see him truly stand up for the rights of the American people instead of bowing to pressure from very vocal (and rich) ideological minorities.   Thank you for the time you took to read my letter. If you have any other questions about the march or the people that attended, please feel free to contact me.   Lauren Husting Rancho Bernardo

       i'm baaaaack!   OH man, I should be sleeping. But, I wasn't able to sleep last night, I was so keyed up, and while I'm fucking exhausted and have lots to do tomorrow, I've been looking at pictures from the march and feeling all the excitement over again.  urlLink Jerry's got some links  that I'm too tired to research/post myself. I will have pictures for you- I got a disposable camera that promises me a free digital CD so I will find a way to get a photo album on the internet.   I wish I could live this weekend over and over again.  When it was all over, when I was sitting in the hotel room trying to piece together all of my emotions and package it up into one concise blog, the only thing I could really articulate was that I have never felt so happy. 1.15 million people, and all of them understood. I didn't have to explain or defend myself to anyone. People were smiling, laughing, introducing themselves, screaming and wetting their pants when they saw Ani D (I was), making clever signs and t-shirts, chanting empowering slogans, feeling angry, feeling like they could take on the world, challenging patriarchy, creating their own marvelous pro-woman world. And it was like a great weight was lifted from my shoulders. I had tears in my eyes the whole day, and when I wasn't crying, I was laughing from pure pure joy. I met some fantastic people. I felt the hatred that usually surrounds my ideals and beliefs dissolved and wrapped up in warmth. This is what the world could be like, if we'd only let it.   And when I realized that I have to go back into this world that requires me to be on the defensive and argue every nuance, every right til it's bloody and useless, that burden fell back on my shoulders ten times as heavy and as hard. I go between elation and depression- elation that my voice was heard, that I got to experience this and spread the word, and I feel my feminism and activism invigorated and twice as strong. Depression- I miss it. I miss that damn march. I miss all those people, most of whom I don't have names for, but all of them with gorgeous smiles and righteous attitudes. 1.15 million women and men, children, dogs even- the energy was unbelievable.   Ani. Fuckin' Ani. Did you hear her perfect guitar, her fabulous voice on my audblog? Right before she did Your Next Bold Move, she did the spoken word Grand Canyon from her new album. She's so beautiful. With Ani on our side, how could we lose? She's the goddess of everything.   And all these feminist icons. Gloria. Hillary (yes I saw Hillary!). Ellie Smeal. Barbara Boxer. Tyne Daly. Jesus, they just kept coming. The actors and artists: Julianne Moore and Camryn Mannheim, Kathy Najimy, Janneane Garafalo, Wanda Sykes, Moby, Sarah Weddington....  I can't believe I have to go live my regular life tomorrow. It's all a dream? It feels like it. But that's my voice on my blog, that's Ani singing to me and to everyone, and most of all to Bush, what the hell  is  your next bold move? Can you deny our numbers and our strength? Can't you at least stop to listen?   My pictures will come soon. Now, it's time for rest.

       now, for the real thing   I'll be spending the night with Cara, as we're getting up at the buttcrack of dawn to drive to LAX. Thus, I bid you adieu until Sunday, when I will have an audio post for you about all the fun and exciting stuff I am doing (compressed into two short minutes). Watch the news, watch the papers, surf the internet-- you might see me, or at least the top of my head.   Hasta la vista!

       a few things to read today   In the "blind outrage" category, there's a bill going through the Michigan houses that will  urlLink allow Michigan doctors refuse to treat gays if they so choose . The bill is being pushed by the Michigan Catholic Conference. Correct me if I'm wrong, but if someone thinks that there are people in the world who don't deserve proper and safe medical care, then they shouldn't become a doctor in the first place. Also, great Christian principles, guys. Way to represent compassion and servitude as a cornerstone of your religion. We must know a different Jesus, because that doesn't sound like the guy I know at all. From  urlLink Republic of T.   Update: Another way to interpret the bill is  urlLink here,  seeing it as allowing health care professionals to refuse to fill prescriptions for birth control, EC, provide abortions, etc. Ah. So it's one of those kinds of things. One more thing to speak out against this weekend. (new link from  urlLink Echidne of the Snakes )  In the "wow, that's scary and fascinating at the same time" category:  urlLink The real reasons Columbine happened five years ago . The media was quick to peg this as a school shooting brought on by violent music, inconsiderate bullies, and blind teenage rage. Psychiatrists have been studying the two killers in the years since and have come to a much different conclusion. Read it. Sadly, this won't likely make it into mainstream news; it's too useful as evidence against people who seek to blame popular music and violence in movies as the driving force behind every criminal act. Via  urlLink swirlspice .  In the "ooh, I'm excited, stoked, psyched, antsy, and all worked up" category:  urlLink Look  at all the fun stuff I get to do this weekend! I need to get a camera, and I'm thinking of getting one with black and white film along with a color one, to take some artistic, nostalgic shots. The color one, for when I meet Ani and squeal like a little boy. I'll also have to stop myself from buying every cool T-shirt I see.   In the "heehehee, that's priceless" category:  urlLink Supermodel Personals . "Marblehead- Do you know the correct pronunciation of Commes des Garcons? WASP overachiever, blueblood scion of a successful horse breeding family seeks lazy, fat, alcoholic to hog the remote-control, and have sex in the coatroom at fancy parties. APRIL FOOLS! I'd never go out with a fat dude- though I'd consider lazy if you're hot." Via  urlLink Green Fairy .

       okay,  now  i'm blogging from work   While I'm in DC, I'll be for obvious reasons unable to detail the experiences in written form. However, I've signed up for one free  urlLink Audio Blog  that I will use at the March on Sunday to give a brief update. Pretty cool, huh? Hopefully it'll work, and maybe I'll become instant chums with Ani DiFranco or Pink (yah, they'll be there!) and they will sing you a song instead. Who knows? I'm so excited, I can hardly sit still.   Note to self- cleaning waterbottle occasionally reduces your chances of drinking gross, grimy water.

       you've got questions? i've got answers    For  urlLink Sheena :    1. What is your favorite beer? and why?   urlLink Berghoff Dark , because not only is it awesome, I have great memories attached to drinking Berghoff. Most of them are also related to Paisan's and Brass Bash.   2. What is it you love about the trombone?  A timely question, since I spent Saturday loving the trombone (minds out of the gutters, chaps!). There's lots of reasons, but above all I love that it is such a flexible sonic instrument-listening to that all trombone jazz ensemble brough the point home. It's the only instrument you can put in an ensemble with its ilk and have it sound as varied and textured as a diverse group. Lots of other instruments sound good in choirs, but not as orchestral.    3. What is the most important thing to you, what would you miss the most if it/them went away?   Trite, but true: Laughter. and I would miss laughter.    For Megan:     What's your favorite fish to eat out of a trombone?  Tuna.   Where do you want to be in 10 years?  Lauren aged 32...I can't even think about that right now. I'm freaked out enough by Bethany's last question. But, to be fair: I want to be successful, in the sense that I have found a calling and enjoy what I'm doing (money is not a factor in my success, although money is nice), or at least am working my way to whatever my goal is. Be it an orchestra or chamber job, or perhaps something feminist-related, I just want to know that I am content with what I do.   If you could be any kind of chocolate, what would you be?  Mint.   For  urlLink Davis :    If you had a million dollars how would you spend it?  I would buy lots and lots of books and cds, and donate to all the organizations that keep asking me too except I can't afford it (NARAL, HRC, Buzzflash, the Buddhist monks, etc). Also, travel.    What is your favourite movie?   urlLink The Red Violin.     If you could have dinner with any famous person, alive or dead, who would you choose?  Katherine Hepburn. or Ani Difranco. Or Sergei Prokofiev. I can never choose.   For  urlLink Ms Lauren :    1. Why?  existentialist answer: because we are all just a big booger in the nose of God. normal, sad answer: Likely because I'm bored, or lonely, or both.    2. Most frustrating thing your mother ever said to you.  "You have to read both  urlLink The Rules  and Dr Laura's  urlLink 10 Stupid Things Women Do To Mess Up Their Lives  before you can start dating." Ugh, back then it was annoying because it was motherly advice, now it's frustrating and infuriating because...well, you know why. *Shudder* I feel slimy just linking to that woman...   3. How about squash?  Squash is cool. I like cooking with Italian squash (the green kind) because it adds a nice flavor to stir fry.   For  urlLink Bethany :    What's your favorite bar in Madison and why?  Hawk's. That place just feels so chill and friendly (that might be because every time I've gone there it's been chill, and I've been with friends), and I love the brick walls and warm tones. Even when busy, it's easy to feel at home. Also, great curly fries. Paul's Club a close second.   What's the thing you hate most that some people do?  When someone passes him or herself as stupid or uninterested as an excuse to not learn or understand something new. People who are always whining about math get to me sometimes, because, I have to struggle with math too, but I kind of like it for that reason. Playing dumb is not cute, sexy, cool, or a way to get into my pants.   What are your main 3 goals in life from now until the end of the summer?  B-dogg, you have no idea how much it freaks me out that I can't answer this question. And it's only the summer! Not even, before I die, or before I'm 30 or something... well, 1. Have some money in the bank 2. Turn 23 successfully, and have a good time whilst doing so.  3. Know where I'm going to be in August and start moving there.   For  urlLink Jerry :     1) What did I eat yesterday?  I don't know. I know on Sunday you had a burrito from Q-doba, and I was jealous.   2) Why, in your Ani post, did you not discuss the utter brilliance that is Outta You, Onto Me (track 2) and Going Down (track 9) of Dilate? Undisputably the two best tracks on that album.  I don't know. They are good tracks, but the ones I quoted were most relevant for my mood. Truly, all the tracks are relevant to the mood in question, but that's a lot of tracks. Also, if you are so upset, write your own letter to Ani. Also also, I think Done Wrong is the best song on the album.    3) Where is the O.Z. and why did Jay-Z use to move snowflakes there? What does it mean?!  I have no idea what you're talking about. Ask better questions.    For  urlLink Hans  (keepin it real):    What's your favorite flavor?  Clam Chowder.   Which is your favorite finger?  Left pinky.   If you had to get rid of an animal species, which would it be?  Honestly? Homo sapiens.   Good questions, guys! Thanks for playing, see you next time on Make Lauren Think Hard and Long About the Meaning of Life.

       dear ani difranco   I don't know what jerk broke your heart or what the circumstances were, but regardless, the music you make on  Dilate  just sends me spiraling back into what may not be a similar situation, but feels like it. From the beginning, from  urlLink Untouchable Face , there is anger, mixed with sadness and acceptance that feels so familar. Ahem:   so fuck you  and your untouchable face  fuck you  for existing in the first place  and who am i   that i should be vying for your touch  who am i   bet you can't even tell me that much   and then,  urlLink Superhero , desperation:  if i was dressed in my best defenses  would you agree to meet me for coffee if i did my tricks with smoke and mirrors would you still know which one was me if i was naked and screaming  on your front lawn would you turn on the light and come down screaming, there's the asshole  who did this to me stripped me of my power stripped me down   But, you know these lyrics, you wrote them. It's for me that I repeat them, because it shocks me how much they resonate... It's  urlLink Dilate  that shakes me to the core, that speaks volumes about my own experience:  and you are so lame  you always disappoint me it's kinda like our running joke but it's really not funny i just want you to live up to the image of you i create i see you and i'm so unsatisfied i see you and i dilate   That chord, that you hit on "dilate." Damn, woman, that's where I start crying. Every time. What unholy goddess gave you the power to have some much control over my emotions? And how did you know? Isn't it hell? And although it's been years, although I've recovered, and I can't even say it was that big a deal, in the long run, in the grand scheme of things, and that I've moved on and become a better person for it, I remember  urlLink this:    and now i'm tired and i am broke and i feel stupid and i feel used and i'm at the end of my little rope and i am swinging back and forth about you  and before it gets so cold that the rain turns to snow there's just a couple things i'd like to know   like how could you do nothing and say, i'm doing my best how could you take almost everything and then come back for the rest how could you beg me to stay reach out your hands and plead and then pack up your eyes and run away as soon as i agreed     I don't have any excuse to go through all of this in my head again. It's been rationalized, justified, and most of all, forgiven. I do it now because I can't complain about anything else. I have nothing better to do; my inner drama queen wants the pain and the heartbreak back. So, I listen to the things that remind me of the times, partly to feel something again, partly to get past it once and for all. Because somehow you understand this, you made  urlLink Joyful Girl  the last track...   i do it for the joy it brings because i'm a joyful girl because the world owes me nothing and we owe each other the world i do it because it's the least i can do i do it because i learned it from you and i do it just because i want to because i want to    Through the fire we go, in each of our relationships, with all of the intensity and pain and hurt that we inflict on each other in the world. Like flint, we come out the other side harder, and more useful. Sharpened, and stronger. What does it matter what we've lost, when we've gained so much? What is a happy life, without the darkness inherent in living, to contrast it? I'm thankful for heartache, sometimes. It sounds silly to say, but I wouldn't have learned anything about the second time if I hadn't done it once before.   I love you, Ms Ani. I hope I see you in DC this weekend. All my best, Lauren

       meming it up, monday style   Via  urlLink Republic of T.   (I'm not sure if this'll work, since you all are bad at answering questions I ask-ooh, burn. ;) Anyway, prove me wrong!)  This one has the potential to be an interesting exploratory exercise, and I'm interested in seeing what comes of it. Here's how it works.  I want everyone who reads this to ask me 3 questions, no more no less. You may ask me anything.  Then to go to your journal or weblog, and copy and paste this allowing others (including myself) to ask you anything. Please do a trackback ping so I'll know that you copied it (if you don't know what that is, ask me. If you don't have a webpage, ask me questions anyway).  Answers will be given in a follow-up post.

       trombone dorkiness!   Yesterday I got up bright and early (5am) to venture northward to the OC. The reason for my journey was not to go to prom with Paris Hilton, or have steamy sex on the beach and then fret about it later in my parents ridunkulously huge Spanish-style mansion overlooking the ocean (although, I would drive to the OC for hot steamy beach sex in a second). No, the purpose of my journey was far more noble, and career-expanding. Below, a recap of the events pertaining to one April 17th, 2004, aka Trombone Day LA. Warning! Likely not interesting or even comprehensible to anyone but Jason and Beatriz (and any other bonists reading).   8am: Registration. Jim Prindle, who coaches RB High's low brass, was there, so we chatted a bit.   8:30: Intro/short concert by the CSU Fullerton Trombone Choir. Nice rendition of Monochrome II by Peter Schikele (of PDQ Bach fame).   9am: Group warmup with professional trombonist Jeannie Little. I learned a lot of cool warm-up exercises here that I plan to implement...er, today, yeah. Today I will practice. ;)  10: Trombone choir readings. These were broken up into small groups: beginners, high schoolers, college and professionalers, and weekend warriors. Jeannie conducted the college group, and we played through the Flor Peeters quartet (I love that sucka), the Gordon Jacobs Octet (woot!) and Passacaglia (Bach).  My lips hurt at this point. Yes, practicing today. Definitely.   11:30: Lunch is a very small slice of pizza that costs me a buck. Obnoxious.   12pm: Exhibits! Trombones to try! I fiddled around on a few Conns (eh...) and then, I saw it. A  urlLink Shires orchestral tenor  with  urlLink T47 slide ,  urlLink medium weight red bell  with experimental in-line valve (I told you'd I'd be dorking out). Ooooooh Mama. Why did I play this trombone? I lust. I pine, I burn. The crook was a little smaller than my Edwards (the crook determines the width of the slide), so it was easy to handle and I can imagine I could play for longer before my left hand got sore. Across the board the horn was lighter (I also tried a  urlLink Shires bass  with double thayer that was so easy on the wrist...) but when I played it...huge-ass golden sound. A little brighter than what I'm used to, but oh, it sounds so good. So good. That in-line valve. Smooth as buttah. Anyone got an extra $3,200 lying around?   While I was playing the Shires (mmm, Shires) two of the Bones Apart girls came giggling into the exhibit room with a video camera. They now have my stunning rendition of a three-octave Bb major scale preserved forever in their memory.   12:30 pm: Concert by Bones West, a large jazz ensemble consisting entirely of trombones, plus drums, piano and bass. While I am usually more than likely annoyed by novelty jazz acts that play poor/easy arrangements of standards (Think: Ladies Must Swing), Bones West was pretty cool. It wouldn't work with any other instrument; trombones however, are properly versatile as a choir to cover all the bases of sound and texture. So, A+.   1:30: Clinic with  urlLink Bones Apart!  The Main Event. The Big Kahuna. The Creme de la Creme. They opened up the clinic with a fanfare and blew us all away (no pun intended). Seriously, these cats can blow. And their technique...daa-yam. The three tenors, Becca, Becky and Carol, studied with Chris Houlding at  urlLink RNCM , who if you remember I played in a master class for in November. I can see that his students do fairly well for themselves. Sheeeeit. Their playing leaves nothing to be desired. They could use a little work on their masterclass speaking/organization, but I understand that they are only just starting to do this kind of thing. It was great to see them interact though, their personalities are over the top (not under ;) and they are all freakin' hilarious. I have a crush on Lorna, the bass trombonist. Thick scottish accent! Bwah! OH yeah, and she's flawless on that sterling silver Conn...  At the end of the class they played Kabalevsky's Dance of the Comedians, and it was faster, I swear, than I've ever even heard an orchestra play it. Jaw is officially dropped.   3pm: A concert/clinic with jazz greats Andy Martin and Bob McChesney. I heard two charts, but I was just so tired I didn't feel like I could enjoy it. I'm weird about trombone jazz. Or just not really into it. Besides, in my opinion the combo is a little stale, relying too much on every playing structure: Opening theme, solo for everyone, closing theme. Meh. Those guys are great players though. I just wanted to see if I couldn't wander around and run into BA again. I didn't, but I chatted with a guy named Adam about some stuff.   5: Slide care clinic with John Sandhagen. Here's where I learned a shitload. It's cleaning day for Bernard and Bianca today, what with all I've learned on proper slide care...huzzah!   6: Adam and I drove over to a strip mall for dinner.   7:30: Prepare to be amazed. Bones Apart, in concert.  They opened with Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, JS Bach. Kicked the living shit out of anything Canadian Brass has ever done with this piece. Holy Mother of Pickles. I start to shake.  Highlight musically of the concert was the piece commissioned by Bones Apart, Secret Love Songs. Involving just about every mute know to trombonanity. Man, trombones are so cool. I need to snag a recording of this piece.  Highlight comedically of the concert was the Finale from Faust (Gounod). Heeee!! My crush on Lorna has reached epic proportions. She has a monologe describing the plot of Faust, and then the other members come out as the respective characters. They do a dance number, whilst playing. Woooo!! Tears streaming from my eyes funny.  Lots of other good stuff. One of their encores (of three) was the Star Spangled Banner, which wasn't particularly great until they got to the piccolo solo, where Carol just kicked it into high gear and trilled that mo-fucka to death. I'm still shaking.   After the concert I got their autographs and they invited everyone to come have a pint. That was pretty cool. I didn't get to talk with them much; but then again I'm a social moron around amazing musicians, so that's my own damn fault. I didn't stay long anyway-had to get home so I could deal with the poop Chipper left in the living room for me. Hurray!   All told, a day well spent. But I still shouldn't have played that Shires.

       this was going to be a special "first-ever" blog   but it just didn't work out that way. It was going to be the "First ever Blog from Workplace" entry. My computer time was hijacked by a coworker (who didn't know what a blog was, in fact, seemed to be surprised that you in fact can read things on the internet at all...) who was playing this stupid Tanks game obsessively, and making much ado about it. Anyway, enough about that.   Did I mention my job is easy? Here's what I did today on my 8-2:30 shift:  -Emptied trashcans -Watched coworker play annoying badly animated flash game -Escaped to the basketball court and practiced my freethrow (all this talk of ball has made me anxious to play--it's about that time for the Tuba-Euph softball game/cookout with violent basketball bonus time and this is the first time in four years I shan't be going...) -Read some articles in Bitch -Half an hour lifeguarding -Examined the contents of the first aid kit. This first aid kit is struggling harder than Bush at a press conference. Let us put food on your family. And no band-aids. Also, baffled by presence of two bottles of meat tenderizer.  -Walked to local strip mall for lunch -Half an hour lifeguarding -Talked to different coworker about mutual acquaintances the Loomis family. Megan, this is Aaron Gallant, who claims to be a good friend of your brother. Did he go waterskiing with us that one time?  -And...done.   House is nice and quiet, empty, wonderful. I'm off to the grocery store to stock up, and also get ingredients for the deliciously alcoholic sounding sangria for which  urlLink Erica  has given me a recipe. I'll be packing it in early tonight so I can be up at the buttcrack of dawn to head to Fullerton. Hell, I'm already tired. Maybe I'll just go to bed after dinner.

       fun with futurama quotes   Jeez, I'm beginning to be as bad as Grant and Chris, only with the other Groening show that is way better (see, I'm justified). All headers and two links are quotes- name the character who says each and win...a chance to party with Slurms McKenzie. Whimmy whim wam wozzle!  Links are back, along with your favorite Sesame Street Terror Alert (be glad it's not the dancing banana), my  urlLink Amazon Wishlist  (3 months til the big 2-3! hint: season 3. Season 3!!!!), and some other stuff. Okay, no other stuff. Just the links. Atom feed is  urlLink here . I don't know what that means or why I'm doing it, but it was requested of me by people who are web nerdy about such matters.    Items of note: 9 days until the March. 8 days until I leave. Yahoo! Tomorrow begins my Weekend of Freedom. Can't come too soon, I say. My parents have been pestering me all night: "Lauren, do you know how to give Chipper his pills? Lauren, don't forget to put out the trash! Lauren, do these dishes. Lauren, park your car in the garage while we're gone" etc etc. Meh.  On Saturday, I'll be  urlLink here , dorking it up with other CA trombonists. Bones Apart, man, for free! That shizzles my nizzle. That takes the cake. That technically qualifies as "ill"...  And as a final note, because I am in a quoting mood tonight, I leave you with  urlLink this Dave Chappelle quote  that has been floating around in my head all week and causing me to randomly bust a gut:   "We are the Time Haters. We travelled all the way back in time...to call you a cracker."

       seriously, who do i have to kill?   something just snapped in me, while i was watching tv. maybe it was the coincendental arrangement of images. the anti-variety of images of women. boobs. tans. the same too skinny, too voluptuous, too fake, too sexed female frame i see every day, day after day, on tv, on billboards, in movies, in magazines...  i am fucking sick of all of it. fucking tired of the bloody asswipe beauty myth male gaze crap that i can't avoid no matter how many times i switch channels on the tv, or even if i turn it off, i can't escape it, it's all around, i might as well live in a stupid hole in a stupid tree with a raccoon (stupid) like that one kid, in that one book. before, it made me angry, yes. i felt like it was my role as an educated person to edumacate other said persons on the ill effects of media representations of women. i can go about my business and not apply it to myself, and deny the power it attempts to claim on my self-esteem and my bank account (or can i? can i really?). but now, now i'm just angry. flaming mad. "if i were god i would rain fire down from the heavens" angry. pissed.   and it's not like any one thing really did it. first, i was watching this episode of "made" on mtv, because the girl was sweet and cool and reminded me of me. she was a nerd, and invisible, and a smart cookie (maybe i wasn't a smart cookie. maybe a smart brownie). and then she decides she wants to be in a beauty pageant (AND WHAT FUCKING HIGH SCHOOL HAS A BEAUTY PAGEANT?!?!? THAT'S FUCKED UP AND BEYOND LAME) and turns out primped and processed just like all the other girls. A looker, to be sure, and great that she found this confidence and made some friends. Is she really grown up? maybe a little bit more. is she ready for the sexuality this new beautiful her is going to force upon her? why the fuck is this high school having a fucking beauty pageant?!?!?  and then i saw this sports illustrated ad about the special edition special crap mini basketball (who wants a damn mini basketball? you can't play with it. you can't cuddle it at night. you can't do CRAP with a CRAP mini basketball) about how great it is that UCONN won the whatever they won that everyone's just shitting their pants about and i thought. WAIT A MINUTE didn't their women's team kick a lot of shit on the court this year too? Where's their special edition crappy mini basketball? oh, i bet it'd be pink. barf me with a spoon. And THEN they do the whole, subscribe/buy your crappy mini basketball now and get all these other wonderful issues of sports illustrated and they flash the issues past you and of course one of them is the swimsuit issue and that's where i just lit on fire and started foaming at the mouth. and here i am. trusted blog. ranting. sick of bullshit. sick to fucking death of bloody sexist patriarchal bullshit ass clown media. fuck. shit. cunt. bitch. wanker. to you objectifiers of women, i quote the immortal words of bender b. rodriquez(a).   bite my glorious golden ass.      SOOOOO How you all doing? Haven't heard from some of you lately. Davis? Jason? Dan? Hellooooo??? I'm doing great. I have a job, and it's easy. I work tomorrow from 11-5. I realized yesterday that even though I tried, I really tried, I just don't like Elvis Costello. I mean, I like "Shipbuilding" and that's why I checked out the greatest hits cd, but man, I just don't dig it. I still like shipbuilding though. That's a quality song. Just not the rest of them.   Thank you, and goodnight.

       the moderate thrill of mild adventure (or, musings on my weekly trip to ramona)   There's something about it. Is it the curves and twists that display breathtaking view after breathtaking view? The feel of your car's effortless acceleration as it kicks up an incline? The sharp line between mountain and sky? The feeling of leaving reality behind and entering a realm free of urban concern? The small country touches?   It's not quite a mountain, but bigger than a hill. It doesn't take long to get to the top before you go down again. Sometimes, you'll get stuck behind a slow-moving boat trailer or chicken truck. The destination is not the most exciting of places, just a medium-sized mountain town, with its collection of quaint antique shops (for the tourists) and sparkling new strip malls, parking lots freshly paved. Within a block you leave behind wooden fences and dirt roads and enter a main street just like any other, with Albertsons and banks and repair garages. The high school kids are not different or backward. Nothing is perched on a cliff or overlooking a dramatic view. Just Ramona.   Driving up though, it's like leaving behind cares and concerns, zooming up a mountain, soaring through curves, escaping the inescapable housing complexes and ubiquitous gas stations of the valley below. There are some amazing views, and when the sky is just the right blue and the sun is in just the right place, the hills scissor the sky and sit aloof and proud against the backdrop of clouds. Sometimes you'll come around a bend and there a mountain sits, larger-than-life, the road ahead disappearing into the belly of the beast. Before you get there, the road will curve away and you'll sidle up to the giant and say hello. Until then, it's like approaching a new mystery, going underground to discover what lurks. Feeling the weight of earth above your head and grounding you, reminding you of both human engineering and mortality simultaneously. The conflict of science and nature, entwined. The birds that soar above the valleys take on the illusion of majesty, no matter what kind they be. It's all hawks here. Eagles.   Too short, the drive is. Soon enough you'll find human kind again, destroying and building, multiplying...so close to the wonders of wilderness that the threat feels imminent, palpable. Which will win? On either side, civilization is creeping up on the unsuspecting, will they be taken advantage of? Will a line be drawn, a contract signed? Is fire enough to keep them away? How soon will our experiences of nature be contained, boxed in by irrigated lawns and 7-elevens, a dollar to visit, a quick hike, the possibility of seeing something rare that used to not be so rare before...before we all got greedy and took what isn't ours to take.   Until then, you appreciate the moments you have.

       good news everyone!   My parents are taking a vacation April 16th-21st. They are driving to Carlsbad, New Mexico to see the fun stuff there and then spending a few days on their way back in Tucson.   Let's run that past you again. My parents are on vacation for 1-2-3-4-5- 6  days! My parents are not in San Diego! My parents are not in the house bugging me! My parents are not watching TV 24-7! My parents are not doing the crossword puzzle before I can get to it! My parents are not waking me up by slamming the garage door at 7 am! My parents are not leaving plates with ketchup on them out overnight and are not annoying me with the evil day old ketchup smell!   If I had friends, I'd have a party.   I'm so totally going to walk around in various states of undress the whole time. Nekkid, if I so choose. I will masturbate on the couch. Maybe I'll get ridiculously drunk randomly and watch porn on the computer. The possibilities are endless!   You need not fear, these six days will not be wasted. However, if you are my friend and you live within a 50 mile radius of Rancho Bernardo, CA (hell, I'll even say 100 miles), you are welcome to come and  get  wasted with me. In my empty house. Just as long as you don't scare my dog. He has a faulty bladder.

       i heart prokofiev   I was wondering today what it is that makes certain music worthwhile for some people, not so for others, hated with a passion for some people, etc. What makes Prokofiev my favorite composer, yet other people love Mahler or Beethoven or Part (that was for you, Bethany)?  I enjoy those composers, but they don't have the significance or draw that my dearest Sergei does.   It's partly sentimental- my first Prokofiev experience is thanks to Jon Mortison, who gave me a recording of Alexander Nevsky in high school. It hit a chord with my dark, intense little teenage soul, longing for significance and individuality amid the superficiality of everything around me. Or something like that. It was, for all intents and purposes, something I could lie on the floor listening to at top volume being shaken to the core with emotion. From Nevsky, I moved on to Romeo and Juliet. Ooh, those chords at the beginning of the Introduction to Act III. OOoooooh man. They leave me breathless every time. The effective use of dissonance--the build-up the crash, the release, so desperately orgasmic. And the Quarrel scene/death of Tybalt. Let me tell you, nothing has ever been so much fun to play on bass trombone.   To the things I originally loved about Prokofiev, the darkness, the despair of his intense moments, I have added a joy in his humorous moments, the light-hearted compositions that betray a jovial tone (Think: 5th Symphony, second movement). As playful as he can be though, I love these moments even more for the weighty undercurrent present in the small dissonances, the little quirks of sarcasm bordering on dark humor. With this I can identify, my own humor often being a little serious and self-hating (all in good spirit, though ;). Manic and depressive smushed into one concise package, if you will.   As an exercise in curiosity (mine), take your favorite composer or band (absolute favorite, numero uno, all time best) and think about what it is about them that grabs your soul and shakes you to the core. Or, perhaps you are of a lighter disposition than I and you like your music to lift you up and sing to your spirit, but why? Is it personal, sentimental, or driven purely by an interest in creativity, perfection, or beauty? A combination of all of these plus extra? When and where do you enjoy them the most? Or do you enjoy them because they are perfect for every mood, every situation?   Prokofiev for me is a constant, a pedal point in the vast modulation of my musical tastes keeping the composition together. Music obsessions have come and gone (as much as I still appreciate them, I can't say I listen to CAKE even half as much as I used to- some of you might be glad about this). He influences my other classical repetoire (oh, those darn Soviets), determines what I love to play in an ensemble, and even goes so far as to pick and choose my various pop/rock/alternative forays.   Lauren's Recommended Prokofiev:  From  Romeo and Juliet : Intro to Act III, The Quarrel (Act I Scene i), Masks (Act I Scene ii), Juliet's Room (Act III Scene iii), Morning Serenade (III, iii) Symphony No 5 (esp mvts 2 and 3) Lt Kizheh Suite From  Alexander Nevsky : The Battle on the Ice Piano Concerto No 2 Tales of an Old Grandmother (for Piano) Violin Concerto No 1 (mvt 1 for the rockin' tuba solo)  The Love for Three Oranges , best (and weirdest) opera,  ever .

       distressing news!   From  urlLink YoungBlood , an email with some news that made my heart stop beating and time freeze whilst the rain poured down and lightning struck the barren earth:   nat mcintosh, our sousaphonist, is taking a leave of absence from the band to work on other projects, and consequently we're looking for someone interested in playing with us.    No one can replace Nat! What's YBBB without Nat? NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!

       6 cds, 4 books, 2 hair-related annoyances, and 1 fun fact   6 CDs: I raided the Classical L-R drawer at the library today, and apparently am in a mood to double my Mahler collection.   Mahler Symphony No 2 LSO/Bernstein Mahler Kindertotenlieder LSO/Bernstein/Janet Baker Mahler Symphony No 2 SFSO/Blomstedt (Wait, I thought it was No 8? Sheeet) Mahler Symphony No 7 CSO/Abbado Prokofiev Symphony-Concerto for Cello and Orchestra NSO of Ukraine/Kuchar/Rudin Prokofiev Romeo and Juliet Cleveland/Maazel (I can't believe I don't already have this. Well, the situation is rectified)  4 books:   Gabriel Garcia Marquez,  The General in His Labyrinth  Margaret Atwood,  Bodily Harm  Norman Mailer,  The Gospel According to the Son  Ed. Robin Morgan,  Sisterhood is Powerful   Speaking of SIP- here's a library-related annoyance as a bonus to you, the lucky reader- RB used to have all its feminist texts in one convenient location. There weren't many, but the classics were there as well as a few very interesting reads. Now, they've done some sort of radical reorganizing which has axed the feminist category all together, separating the books into bigger sections like Motherhood or Race Studies or History, or, where I found SIP, Anthologies. What the fuck, man? I sense a patriarchal plot to keep would-be feminist knowledge seekers from branching out and reading all available literature. Okay, maybe I wouldn't take it that far. But it  is  obnoxious.   2 hair-related annoyances:   #1: When I get my hair cut short (or, -er as the case may be), I'm always mostly happy except for the way the back looks. I always feel like my hairline on my neck should round out the whole pixie cut look, not flatten against my neck and make the back of my head look like a straight line. The  urlLink example on the left  is what I don't like. [Ed. note- Totally have a crush on the girl on the right] The  urlLink one on the right, here  is how I feel it should be (please don't be frightened by the scary woman on the left. Her hair is reminiscent of an upside-down Awesome Blossom). I imagine it has something to do with the shape of my head, the particular hairstylist, etc., and upon further reflection, I think my haircut looks good and I should stop worrying about it like I always do.   #2: I hate having little cut hairs all over the back of my neck for the rest of the day. Grr.  1 fun fact, as promised:   Did you know that when your hair dries quickly, it means you have healthy hair? I am the proud owner of healthy hair, which means I better get to destroying it again with bleach and hair dye. Mwahahahaha!!!

       another day, another design   What do you think? I was getting a little weary of the blues and browns of the waterfall design, and wanted more subtlety. Still playing with code and getting some things fixed/added.   That said, all I've done today is sit at the internet and I have a raging headache. If I had gotten up earlier I could have been lifeguarding: I got a call from one of the places I turned in an ap (not the place that actually hired me) needing an emergency sub. Unfortunately I woke up late and my cell was off all night. Boo. I could have used both the money and the social interaction.   Nevermind though, I've spiffed up buddha stew (and the more I do this, the closer I get to making my own ORIGINAL design and spending the money on a domain and all that fun stuff) and now it's time to either do some yoga or get a haircut. Or both. It's all up to the headache, he's in charge here.

       more quizzy! quizzy! blaaaaaargh!   I'm feeling uninspired to blog, so I'll just keep quizzing so I don't lose any of my valuable readership. ;) This is the [Bracket Quiz] which I found via  urlLink The Republic of T .   [Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says]   The book nearest me is  Julius Caesar , which I have not put away since I referenced it for the Ides of March post. It doesn't have a page "18" so here's what I found on page "xviii":  "..texts so fully dressed. Later texts occasionally show signs of carelessness."  [Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?]  This huge magnifying glass.   [What is the last thing you watched on TV?]  Futurama! Of course.   [With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?]  My dad watching Murder, She Wrote, and any other annoying daytime programming he can find, apparently.   [When did you last step outside?]  Just a few minutes ago, to mail my taxes.   [Before you came to this website, what did you look at?]  At  urlLink We Have Brains  somebody wanted to know where they could find a good feminist or pro choice tshirt to wear to the March. I was looking at the links.   [Did you dream last night?]  I did. One dream involved Hugh Grant in all his goofy, foppish glory, but at the end it turned into some sort of Friday the 13th parody. The other dream I had was about Ryan. Damn you Ryan!! I think Davis was in it too, and she was in a computer animation class where she had to make this picture of Margaret Cho (who was, inexplicably, naked) dance.   [What is on the walls of the room you are in?]  The FISH! (a sailfish, caught by my father in Florida, stuffed and hung on our wall to scare my friends) And the two smaller fish. A clock. Pictures of lighthouses, boats, and birds. This room is nautically themed.   [Seen anything weird lately?]    urlLink Ahem.   [What do you think of this quiz?]  It's cool, man, it's cool.  [What is the last movie you saw?]  Theater: Secret Window. TV: Thelma and Louise.   [If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?]  The entire contents of Borders, except for the New Age music section and the girly magazines. I could probably do without the kids section, too. And all the "Going to the Bathroom For Dummies" books.  [If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?]  I'd like to see what the world would be like if the feminist agenda could run basically unchecked. Or, better yet, what the world would be like if there was no patriarchy.  [Do you like to dance?]  Indeed, I do.   [George Bush:]  "The only bush I trust is my own"  [Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?]   Marian. Or Hazel, after my grandma.  [Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?]   Er. Alexander. My favorite boy name ever. (yes Davis, I covet your boyfriend...'s name) And I would use the Russian diminutives as nicknames: Aloysha, Alexey.   That being said, it's unlikely that I'll have children. Not entirely ruling it out, but, there you have it.   [Would you ever consider living abroad?]   Yep. Montreal if I get into McGill. Europe: anywhere. If my plans of music, activism, or anything else I can come up with fail, I'll be a bhikkuni in Dharmasala, India. ;)

       amusement!    urlLink Right Wing Eye!  via  urlLink Bloggers for Choice .   See, feminists have a sense of humor. I'm surprised they didn't put in a joke about the couple being interracial.   Also via Bloggers for Choice, if you can't make it to  urlLink DC  in  20 DAYS  (I'm excited) but still want to support the cause, check  urlLink this  out.   Seriously though, I want to make a fun poster. Something clever like "If men got pregnant they'd make abortion a sacrament." I'll go through my collection of Ani looking for one of her gems (heck, they're all gems), but I'm open to suggestions. Should I go 60s Old Skool with "Keep your Laws off my Body"? "If you can't trust me with a choice, how can you trust me with a child"? I want it to be original though. If only I had my copy of  Cunt  (HINT HINT HINT HINT HINT) handy for ideas.   Your creative juices are flowing, now....GO!

       hey, i got what i wished for   I AM EMPLOYED!!! OFFICIALLY! None of this crappy petition crap, crap-ass job I couldn't do to save my life (spare me the lecture, Sassypants), but a real live paycheck-every-other-week, sit around in my swimsuit outdoors kind of job. A lifeguarding gig. Huzzah.   In other news, t-minus 20 days until the March for Women's Lives! DC, here I come.   So much to plan for that. Do I make a sign? What should it say? What do you wear to this kind of thing? What's the weather like? What should I do as a tourist? How will I restrain myself from throwing things at Bush should I see him? (Possibly the threat of jail time will help) Will I get to meet Margaret Cho? Go see her show? Will Gloria Steinem be there? When will Jerry send me  Cunt  so I can get it autographed if I happen to run into Igna Muscio like Davis did? Is Davis going? Can we all (Cara, Marisa, Dennis) get mildly (or excessively) drunk on Saturday night and chant feminist slogans into the nighttime sky?   In other other news, I like my trombone again. I have unfolded the folding stand and Bianca has set up permanent residence on the Hamilton once more. Kopprasch has been played. Scales have been executed. The other day I even played bass. It sounded TERRIBLE and I was dizzy. What's next, my mandolin? Oh, and I should write those parts for Blather. Sheeeeit.   In other other other news, it's lunchtime.

       woozy   Does anyone else get really nauseous after playing video games for a longish period of time? Say, an hour? I do. I can't handle much more than that before I start getting slightly claustrophobic and dizzy. It happens with TV too, but on a much smaller scale. Maybe it's something you have to build up to, that intensive video gaming for hours-on-end tolerance that I'll just never have because I don't care enough.   That being said, it's not your average 22 year old that plays The Lion King for Sega Genesis. Well, I am not your average 22 year old.   At one point yes, I beat the stuffing out of this game. I threw Scar over that bitchin' cliff. I am the king of Pride Rock (and get to work, lionesses, killin' me some zebras).   I am slowly regaining my lion skills.   Level 1: The Pridelands No sweat. The rest of the game is much easier if you can get that one bug that doubles your strength.  Bonus level- Make Pumbaa eat lots of bugs. Can't ever get past 36.  Level 2: I Just Can't Wait to be King FUCKING SONG!! FUCKING PURPLE MONKEY!! Otherwise, easy as 1, 2, rrrowr.   Level 3: The Elephant Graveyard. Hyenas everywhere! This one's in the bag, after much practice.   Level 4: the Stampede Not as hard as once thought. Merely a game of avoidance.  Level 5: Simba's Exile You gotta be willing to take a few hits on this one. I finally got past the stupid rolling rock, avoided falling in the thorns, jumped a few gorges, and all of this only to be heckled by Whoopi Goldberg.  Level 6: Hakuna Matata Watch out for the frogs, they spit! Fun with waterslides. And then, there's the... WATERFALL OF DEATH!! (dum dum duuuuuuh) This son of a bitch kills me every time. You have to jump up the logs that are falling down the waterfall, and it goes on for god knows how long (I don't, because I can't fucking do it) and then once you get past it, etc, and do some other stuff, if my memory serves me correct, you have to DO IT AGAIN!!! ARRRGH!!! The logs look like Combos. They make me hungry, inexplicably not for Combos, but for peanut butter. Weird.   And that's were I'm at when I get all queasy and can't handle it anymore. I seem to recall there are 10 levels, the last one being your WWF spar with dear old Uncle. What the others between the WATERFALL OF DEATH and the end are, I cannot remember. In Level 7 you are adolescent Simba, I think. Getting a scruffy little mane. Roar cracking at inopportune moments and embarrassing you in choir. Masturbating constantly to PlayLion. Telling Timon and Pumbaa where they can stuff it. Doing drugs behind the rotting log. Good times, good times.   News of the weekend is: Tomorrow I have an interview for a lifeguarding job (starting immediately) at a local club. Huzzah!

       almost famous   Went to Borders tonight and dove into a collection of Adrienne Rich's poetry and prose. Using my guest blogger status at Feministe I present to you my  urlLink gift of poetry .   At the end there is a little something I wrote. Maybe you can guess who it's about.  Here's one I just wrote, heavily inspired by Ms Rich.  the moon is in her navy sky the stars flank her as she rises the palm trees sway and try to hide her as she flirts shamelessly with the breezes more and more i find i must locate said moon in the night to anchor myself, to feel the joy cast melancholy from my inner depths she smiles and comforts me great goddess of the dark tides of women and mysterious oceans are hers to keep from men gazing on that brilliant sphere i feel- and fear-the world too great for me will swallow me up if i cannot find luna in her castle studded with the heavens to wrap me up and dry my weeping eyes and put laughter in my spirit.   I find I can't help but write poetry these days. It's all floating around in my head and there's no one to blame but Nick and Hans. I'd like to see more of both their poetry as well.   Who knows if it's any good or not, but dammit, I like to write it. New stuff usually appears at my  urlLink livejournal  first, if here at all.

       just randomly posting, bored   Current favorite Futurama quote I am desperate to use in conversation: Hermes: Baby needs a new pair of shoes! Zoidberg: Forget your spoiled baby, I need those shoes!  Things I got in the mail whilst in Texas:   -Ani tickets. *gush* They are sitting on my record player, winking at me seductively. At the concert I am going to buy the biggest fucking poster I can find for my wall in Plano. Big fucking Ani poster. Ginormous. (I've never written that word out before, it looks weird)  -My fun new purse and tshirts. One of them does not fit, oh well. Back it goes.  -A check for $600 from the Ramona Unified School District, my thanks for putting up with the freshman for an academic year and forcing them to become better brass players.   Still waiting in the mail for:  -9 mixed CDs  Obligatory home decoration/Target rant: My mom and I got on a decorating kick today, and went through her collection of posters and prints. I found some neet stuff for my future walls: a menu for the Ghiradhelli Chocolate Factory, several small Mary Engelbright prints, a Del Mar Fair advertisement from 1990, an ornate recipe for cheese fondue. Katie and I went out for coffee and then went over to Target to look at their furniture. The orgasmic WaterPik shower head is only $20, and in August it shall be mine. Goddess, I love Target- especially that I always seem to find a desirable CD there for only $10. Tonight it is the self-titled Phantom Planet album. Also, a rainbow belt that is reminiscent of a belt I had as a young'un, $10. I could in entirety furnish a home and entertain myself for ages at Target, and in fact that is just what I may do in Texas.   Procrastination of the week:  As I mentioned earlier, I have been invited to guest blog at  urlLink Feministe , and it was my intention to do a Susan McClary style analysis of Fanny Mendelssohn's Piano Trio. However, both audio and visual of the piece are proving difficult to find (not a surprise in the stodgily patriarchal art music world). Therefore I'm working on a look at Tara and women in Buddhism.   Weird physical annoyance: My skin is very sensitive and sore on my right side/lower back. Please please don't let me have some sort of organ ailment that requires health coverage. Please.   People I miss/am thinking about a lot right now: Jerry, Abby, Davis (I have a present for you), Ryan, Nick, Hans, Megan, Dan B.

       jet lag!   Okay, not really. For some reason though, this trip exhausted me. I think the month or so of constant swim lessons, lifeguarding, and otherwise intense mental activity (related to making decisions about my future) caught up with me on the plane to Dallas, and thus I spent most of the time I wasn't interviewing or getting lost sleeping.   So, I'm moving in two months. To Plano- I may have mentioned the apartment I was going to look at, well, it's awesome, it's cheap, and it's got a creek and preserve running behind the property. I'm in love. Perhaps it's not the most perfect place I could find- the community is a little older, the upstairs shower is a stall, and there's only washer/dryer hookup (although I think that's standard of all of these condo-esque places), the pool is tiny and curvy not suited to lap swimming, etc. But then, every place has its downsides.   As per Dallas and the area itself, I'm not a big fan. The creek behind this apartment was the deal breaker for me- I've got to have some sort of nature to escape to from the flat suburbs of the surrounding area. It has its pretty places, fields and clumps of trees, but I can tell I'll be drinking in all the nature I can handle in San Diego until then. The cut of a mountain against the sky, the shape of hills and valleys, the cliffs and beaches of the ocean- all of these are things I must learn to do without. I did it in Wisconsin, of course, but I'm insanely in love with Wisconsin and its farmland and subtle hills and lakes and forests. Insanely.   However, I am doing this for money. See, I'll be making more than I know what to do with. More money in the first month than I've EVER had in my bank account. As much as I hate to be that way- well I can't help it. We need money in this society like it or not, and if I want to change paths and forge a different life then I should be confident I can finance it. Three years or so in Texas, then we'll see. Perhaps grad school. Perhaps the east coast and activism. Perhaps I'll get extraordinarily good at trombone and win the Rhythm and Brass audition (I'm projecting). Sigh.   Though, I am excited. This apartment is awesome, I get to share it with Chris, I get to meet new people and be out truly on my own and make my own decisions again. I plan on seeing Jason as often as possible, and making trips to NOLA and Albuquerque and other places whenever possible. During the summer (see, I get summers off!) I can go visit Bethany in Germany. There's still living to be done, and now that everything's settled I'm anxious to be doing it. Two months! It will seem to go by slow, but it'll be fast like ripping off a bandaid and soon enough it'll be Ani's concert on July 27th and the next day I'll be headed out with my stuff packed into every nook of my car. Just like a run-on sentence, it'll be.   Between now and then I still need to have a summer fling, visit Jennii in LA, send Adam off to Boston, think about Jerry getting settled in New York and write lots more poetry. It'll be a busy summer.

       i forgot to tell you   I was doing my best to set aside my stereotypes of Texas until I'd actually been to the place, but the first two people I saw outside of the airport were a man with a killer mullet and a girl yelling, "Hey, y'all! Y'all over hea-re!"  Just so.

       hey everybody, i'm big tex   A quick update- Thanks to Chris for hooking me up with his friends in the area so that I could stay for free. Dollar fucked up my rental car reservation, and then informed me that they were entirely out of cars. I went around to all the other places and found one (E-Z) that was just as cheap as Dollar, and only charged $10/day for my under 25 year old ass, so in all, it ended up being a better deal. I have a Kia. It's nice, you know, CD player, etc. I can't complain.   Interviewed/talked with the dudes at Sachse (pronounced similar to Sexy, hee), a BRAND spanking new school with brand spanking new horns, etc, very nice place. They're going to hook me up with some middle school students as well as their high schoolers. I talked with Mike Brown, who is familiar with teaching in the area- the biggest and most exciting thing he told me is that I can write just about anything I buy off on my taxes. That means I can buy Sibelius (and if I join TMEA, it's 200 bucks less), a laptop, cds, music, etc...woo. Basically I employ myself and make my decisions about how to report to the IRS.   Tomorrow, two schools (Plano and Poteet- coolest name ever), and I'm going to go look at this amazing apartment I found with loft and huge kitchen. Squee. It's beautiful. 2 bed 2 bath, patio, etc, 915/mo. Damn. No state tax here, either. And gas is under 2 bucks!  Dallas, I'm soooooo into you .   I'll have to do some sightseeing as well. I got a little lost on my way to Sexy Sachse, and saw a lot of cows. It's pretty so far...different than both San Diego and Wisconsin.   In other news, I'm extremely flattered that Ms Lauren at  urlLink Feministe  invited me to guest blog for her. I'm working on a post regarding Fanny Mendelssohn's Piano Trio and the feminist sonata form. Keep an eye on her blog for my cameo.   That's all for now!

       face to face with...?   I just had quite an intense morning. I'm working at HCW, doing the usual office things (reading halfheartedly, wandering out to the playground to take occasional naps, shattering Chris' Snake II high score on my cell phone) when one of the Board of Directors comes in (HCW is a community club, run by the home owner's association) to do whatever it is that she does with the homes and the people that reside in them.   Apparently, she and Dana (boss) have quite the relationship going. I listened to them argue in circles and not listen to each other whatsoever for at least three hours, at which point they were still in the same little arguing box, not having made any productive ground. They started to talk about the problems here with the pool, and kids not following rules that is backed up by the fact that many parents expect lifeguards to serve also as babysitters.   BOD lady suggests to Dana that he should not hire female lifeguards for the summer.   I've been blocking out most of the conversation for quite some time now but I have feminist radar, you know, that's always on with a little red light that blips calmly when all is well and goes berserk when I hear discrimination. I keep my feminist radar in excellent condition, spit and polish every morning, regular service trips...  Now, honestly, I think the sort of blatant sexism of the sort BOD lady is projecting is rare and/or contained to small segments of the greater population, so the things she said didn't make me angry in the sense that sexism is rampant and raging in our communities and affecting the status of my employment. Rather, it was personally insulting.   Her reasoning: Girls have trouble being tough with kids and enforcing rules. Come to think of it- this is all she said, with no backup example or anecdotal 'proof'. She told one story about watching a lifeguard discipline a kid and subsequently get bitched out by the kid's parent, after which I was fully expecting her to launch into a flood of tears and quit passionately on the deck of the pool, leaving to mother a hoard of beautiful cherubic children and scrub her husband's feet...but no such ending materialized. Just a sort of basic assumption that it would be for both the club's and the female lifeguard's own good that she not work here as kids are out of control and ill-behaved.   To her credit, she did not know that I am a lifeguard.   However, I am a lifeguard. I have worked in numerous settings: rec pools, lap pools, lake beaches, athletic club pools, and camp pools; I have never made a save but you could reasonably credit that to the efficient manner in which I enforce rules and regulations. I can swim fast; I have no qualms kicking kids out of a pool if they disregard my authority (in fact, it is a pleasurable activity).   The look on my face must have been priceless, because Dana laughed when I stood up fast from my chair and affixed BOD lady with my patented death stare.   Don't argue societal conceptions of gender with a feminist lifeguard. We are mean and we have whistles.   At any rate, I may have impressed upon her in my diatribe the importance of chucking that particular assumption out the window (and cheers to Dana for his example that our weakest lifeguard is a man- and a bodybuilder), but our argument was likely just as circuitous as the earlier ones.   Also, she seems like a pushy and opinionated lady. I doubt that she is projecting her own inability to govern the actions of children onto us, so from wence comes this attitude that women are weak and incapable of discipline? She might be pulling a Phyllis Schfaly on me (Phyllis is a darling right wing shill dedicated to sending women back into the home with their kids, yet last I checked did most of her own work outside of the home).   Interesting to me in this whole experience is the very nature of such a comment seeming so out of place these days. Such a hiring policy as she would see fit to enable is naturally illegal and discriminatory, and in a profession such as lifeguarding rendered outdated. Lifeguarding has been one of the more gender integrated jobs I've worked (okay, it's really the only job I've worked) and, as in real life, inability to do your job properly is an individual fault and not the result of the placement of your gonads.   I guess that would make me optimistic that I don't run into this more often (although I'm still peeved), and that most people would immediately disagree with BOD lady.   Hm, I can't decide...am I optimistic, peeved, or just generally amused?   Or maybe this is one of the reasons to be a feminist. So you can reduce your opponents to a quivering lump of poorly argued jelly.

       declaration   I intend to have a summer fling.   My conditions are ripe for romance (or  urlLink lust  as the case may be):   I am (kinda) newly single (kinda, if you count that Jerry and I parted ways several months past and I have finally been able to move on emotionally just recently).  I have a job which provides me with the necessary golden tan to attract members of whatever sex.   I am moving at the end of July, so there is neither time nor pretense to develop a deep and lasting intimate relationship.  I have a twofer coupon to Magic Mountain and the income to blow on just-barely-above-sleazy hotels in the greater Los Angeles area.   There's nothing that appeals to me more right now than the prospect of hot birthday sex.  I'm ready for anything. Seriously. Bring it on.

       a fool and her money...   I bought some fun feminist-y stuff today, from a store called  urlLink Strange  Monster . It appeals to my inner Lydia.  Even though I desperately need jeans, dress clothes, and shoes, I bought t-shirts. Check 'em out! This is my favorite:     I did get something I needed, though, a new purse/bag:    je les adore.

       the fda is doing some fucked up shit these days    urlLink The US government said it would ban homosexuals from making anonymous donations to sperm banks, in the name of preventing transmittable disease .   Obviously, there is a need to be concerned about the spread of HIV, but, as the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force points out, "The FDA guidelines are unscientific. There is a 72 hour test which would provide information as to whether a person was HIV positive..."  72 hours, and that's it. Instead of turning away viable, healthy donors, the FDA could be actually performing tests that do not discrimate against one segment of the population.   It seems to me the government is afraid of that dreaded "gay gene" that would unleash the horrors of homosexuality upon unsuspecting Americans. Mercy me, wouldn't that just rain on the right-wing parade.   Latent in this action is the hypocrisy of saying one is concerned with the spread of a deadly STI but at the same time spreading misinformation about condoms and denying proper sexual education about transmission and prevention.   Then again, I'm long past the point where I'm surprised at anything the Bush administration and cronies do that is hypocritical or just outright stupid. Tonight would be a good night to start reciting that  urlLink mantra ...

       just a few things i want to do when I get to Dallas   1. Take a self-defense class. I've been itching to find one for a while now, but haven't had the money. I was hoping that Frogs would offer one (being as I can go to any of their classes for free as an employee), but unfortunately they don't. They do, however, have three different yoga classes and a pilates workout, which I will be attending next time around.   Self-defense in whatever form, I think, is important. I like to be on top of my game, physically and mentally, and to have control of a situation when I feel threatened or in danger. I can buff up in other ways (like Nick and I doing medicine ball routines at the pool), but I'd like to learn how to bring a man down, so to speak.   An interesting side note: I get bored with regular old exercise. So today, after doing a few sets of weight lifting with my mom's two five pounders (wow, that sounds bad), I decided to test my reflexes. Lying on the floor, I would throw one of the weights up in the air and roll to the side just in time to dodge it. So I wouldn't cheat, I made myself wait a split second after I threw it (see, I knew it was coming so it's easy enough to start your roll as you throw it). Hey, I'm pretty good. Next stop, James Bond school.  2. Find mandolin lessons. I've got my mandolin out right now (that also sounds bad), but all I can do is play the same five-ten songs over and over with my atrocious technique (skipping all the ones with chords). I'd like to do more, and learn well enough to improvise and play bluegrass with others.   3. Buy my own webdomain and spiff everything up.  4. Get Photoshop and make my own weblog banner.  5. Build a computer free of all Microsoft products I can avoid (Is Photoshop MS? This should be number 3. Oh well).   6. Brush up my french.  7. Volunteer at Planned Parenthood (in Texas especially they seem to be under vicious attack).   8. Learn how to arrange music, and fiddle around with composition. This requires a few more computer additions including Finale (or Sibelius...which do you prefer?), Cakewalk, etc.   9. Improve time management skills so that I can attempt to do at least three of the above items in addition to practicing, teaching, and sleeping.

       public service announcement   Please go to  urlLink Margaret Cho's blog  and watch the March video she has on the left side of the screen. It had me alternating between tears (goddess, what a beautiful day that was...the memories flooding back) and hysterics (Wanda Sykes! "Look at all this color going to waste!" hehehe) and happiness (well, duh).   The last segment is Ani playing live, which I recorded a snippet of for you  urlLink here .  There's a part in the video with her, Howard Dean, and Margaret that I just love. Hearing her live performance again gets me all reved up to get to July 27th all the more quickly.   I can't believe that was nearly a month ago. The memories are fresh, and poignant, and I'm so proud I was a part of this. The power of a crowd that magnitude, with that much hope and energy and direction-- it leaves me breathless.

       dallas update   I'm flying to DFW next Wednesday, staying through Friday, to do interviews and choose my schools for the fall.   I'm so bloody excited!   I keep thinking about it, about having a steady job and income (steady is all that I really need, not glorious mountains of money), about having a kick-ass roommate in Chris, about finally being free financially of my parents for real.   It's exhilarating!   So far, I have three interviews set up, and hopefully more; I know there's one other band director left to contact me for sure.   And I'm glad I get to visit the area, because I have some serious misconceptions and stereotypes about Texas that need to be either proved or realigned.   This post isn't terribly in depth, but then again, I'm not feeling much more that excitement. I also get the feeling that everyone in the blogosphere is on summer vacation, or close to it. Y'all have been awfully quiet lately...

       bush as a meditation device       Avalokitisvara   Via  urlLink The Republic of T , an article that emphasizes a few of the things I've been thinking about lately in regards to Buddhism and the current state of politics.    urlLink Is Bush the Anti-Buddha?   How does a student of the Dharma deal with the rising temptation to wish ill will on the perpetrators of such shocking and detestable undertakings? To the specter of four more years of Bush, what is an appropriate Buddhist response?  Bush's administration has administered quite a number of negative deeds on both America and the world, in the name of compassion. So much of what I hear on the news each day makes me angry and vengeful- but to act on that is to go against the principles of Buddhism I practice. You must do no harm, you must see every being as worthy of your love and enlightenment. And toward some who give you trouble, who test your patience, you must exhibit infinite compassion. Thus, I can see Bush as a challenge to my bodhimind, put in the path to challenge my resolve. It is easy to feel violent when thinking of the atrocities committed, but instead I must think of the best way to express my compassion.   If Bush continues the path he has chosen, his karma will overcome him for numerous lives into the future. Thus, it is in his best interest, and it is in the interest of conscience-minded Americans whose taxdollars colludes us in any US action, to send him home in 2005:   George W. Bush is unfortunately no Angulimala or Milarepa who were able to overcome, to awaken to the unskillfulness of their actions and repent the loss of life they caused. In fact, Bush may be the closest we can come to an anti-Buddha: a global poster-boy for profound ignorance. We can use him in our visualizations. We can breath in his confusion and breath out to him our clarity. We can also get out on the campaign trail for candidates who more closely represent that first precept: Do no harm. Sit and breathe contemplating this and see if you feel called to volunteer on voter-registration drives.  Mindful that the real source of American power does not come from its superior war machine but from its constitution, its leadership in the global community, its democracy and its history of respect for human rights, George Bush has seriously weakened America. For this he deserves no praise, only reproach. But my practice has helped me prevent any grim imaginings in his regard. When I'm stricken with unskillful thoughts about the President, I immediately focus on the words of the Buddha: "Hatred can never put an end to hatred, love alone can. This is the unalterable law."  Now my visualizations are of bearing witness to a panoply of devas and gods, the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, and countless rows of Buddha's and Bodhisattvas throughout space and time sitting in the clouds and celebrating Bush's retirement from the Oval Office and his safe return to Crawford, Texas.  Then I close with two healing mantras in rapid succession: "May all beings be happy and free from suffering -even Bush" "May all beings be happy -and freed from Bush."   Indeed.   "Oh King, do not kill For all that lives cherishes life. If you wish to live long yourself, respect life And do not even think of killing." -Chapter of the Truthful One

       [zoidberg]finally, i look as pretty as i feel![/zoidberg]   Back to mundane concerns for now.   I finally found a hairdresser who understands. Most of the time, you go in for your standard short pixie cut, and Ms/Mr Barbie Bouffant gives you what I like to call the thirty-something Aunt Trixie look, with the longish mullet-back and the absence of sideburns. You have to beg for texture, and convince her/him to go shorter (funny, they have no qualms about taking too much off when your hair is longer). Style is out of the question; you'll get a little gel or something, and then loads of hairspray (I detest hairspray), but you'll have to go home and survey the damage in your own mirror, after several showers, if you want to know what your haircut actually looks like.  Well today I was lucky enough to get Missy, a grrl with the cutest haircut I've ever seen (and she said she did it herself!), which I covet. She's not too shabby looking herself...in fact, rrrowr. Anyway, we went through the whole description of what I'd like done, what shorter, etc., and she gets it. Immediately. To do the things I want to do with my hair, spikey hip bed-head nonsense and all, she tells me how she will make it so I don't have to spend hours styling (not that I would do that anyhow). Yes. Go Missy, go! And that whole neckline fiasco from last time, I don't even have to break a sweat. Missy's on it. We got the texture, we got the razor cut, we got the funky style.   Tart me up and get me liquored, if I ain't ready for the bars.

       shh, i'm digesting   Finished: urlLink      Let me tell you a story. This afternoon, I took a nap as I was exhausted. Having been suckered into taking the opening shift at Frog's Club this morning, I had been up since 6 am, lifeguarding and teaching swimming lessons sucking all my remaining energy.   While I was sleeping, I had a dream. Not a silly dream, like my last couple, or a crazy dream like they usually are, but a metaphorical, social commentary kind of dream that pretty much sums up everything I've been cogitating on the past week or so I've been reading Mr Jensen's book.   In my dream, I was in my real-life position of swim instructor, and I was talking to a group of parents interested in signing their children up for swimming lessons. After explaining to them what I would be teaching, my various techniques, how long the lessons would be and how much they would cost, I told them they had a choice. They could either enter their children in my class, teaching them how to swim at the expense of the environment (chemicals from the pool killing animals and vegetation, and the pavement laid down to build it having exterminated a rare kind of bird) and at the cost of lives for children in third world countries (their bathing suits, the swim equipment, and the various other materials around the pool deck having been made by sweatshop workers in South America); or, they could not enroll their children, and run the risk that one day, they might drown.   Is that really a choice?   Obviously, I took a lot of out Mr Jensen's book. It's affected me profoundly, and I'm not sure how I can go back to living normally and casually, like so many of us do, in this world that's built on the backs of the less fortunate (and the brown, and the black, and the environment). Who made this computer? Is she still alive? I enjoy my Futurama DVDs greatly, but is it only because I've been fortunate enough to have a strong education in science that allows me to get most of the jokes? I made an extremely sarcastic comment today, my mom having dragged me into Walmart with her causing my eternal bitterness. She wanted to buy gelatin tablets, because it supposedly strengthens your nails and makes them shiny. She showed me, saying, "I think it's made a difference already" to which I responded, "That's great, the cows you killed are glad your nails look nice."   She was hurt, and astounded, but she still bought the capsules.   I can never chronicle precisely how much of what I do, eat, wear, etc, is affecting those who are exploited in other countries. I can't stop using electricity, although who knows what havoc is being wreaked on the environment (someone knows, sure, but I don't, and that's the point). I like scoring a cheap shirt or pair of jeans at the GAP, but at whose expense?   The point is, we don't have choices. Sure, we can decide whether to watch Friends or Fraser (although you'll likely be disappointed in both), eat Domino's or Pizza Hut (again, you'll likely be disappointed in both), you can get gas at Shell or BP (but, Shell's  urlLink intimidating people in Nigeria  while here at home trying to pull the wool over our eyes with their cleaner fuel campaign, and British Petroluem struck a deal with China to  urlLink drill in Tibet  through extremely fragile ecosystems and nomadic pathways). You have lots of "choices" but none of them are truly any different from the next.   Even if I want to eat organically, I have to take my car to Henry's. If I want to keep in shape, I have to douse myself in a pool filled with chemicals- chlorine being one of them- either that, or I have to pay to go (again by car) to a "preserved" area, set aside and maintained so that I can convince myself I'm communing with nature.   Who mined the metals that made my trombone? How many trees did it take to make my library collection? What is the indigenous name for the place I live in? What kind of plants used to be here, and how many that are now don't belong?   So, where do I look? How do I stop this madness, or at least take steps to correct it? Choose my battles? Become a hermit?   How do you guarantee you have real, palpable choices in this world? What kinds of decisions do you make to live freely? Can you take all the anger and frustration and sadness and roll it up and make it effective? Let me know. Otherwise, I'm thinkin' we're doomed.

       bah!   I'm awfully lonely.   I should know better than to do any of the following things:  -Look at my blog archives -Peruse photo albums -Attempt to call old friends -Think  Looking back on this year it seems to me like it was a complete and utter waste of time. I know there are those of you out there getting all geared up to comment with "No, nothing is ever a waste of time, think about the stuff you did that was fun, educational, or profitable..." Before you do, understand that when things are a complete waste of time for me, it all boils down to one thing:   I don't have enough time with friends.   What's the point in reading lots of books if you don't have anyone to share it with? What's the point of money if you can't go out and buy drinks for people? What's the point of fun if most of it was had watching entertaining TV programming or spent reading humorous blogs on the internet?   Okay, I won't be so utterly pessimistic. Here are some of the things that stood out from the academic year 2003-2004:  - urlLink Youngblood at Winston's  -Googaloo rehearsals -Madison in October - urlLink Bela Fleck  -Jerry's visit -Audition Tour 2004 -Having time to cook -Conversations with Natalie - urlLink Hillcrest 101   At work Wednesday I had a short conversation with Linda, the director of the swim lessons program, about my plans for the fall and if she wants me to continue teaching all the way until I move. She's a great lady; she was so excited for me and promised to give me her son's contact information. He's a tuba player in Houston, apparently. Anyway, she said one thing that stuck out in my mind, meant as a reason for me to consider joining the Masters swim program (which I am, anyway). Basically it was framed around "well, I know you might not make many friends around here so..." I think it might have been part compliment, part slur on the other employees. I'm not sure. But she's right to one extent; these are all extremely nice people I work with but the combination of our busy teaching schedules and our disparate ages makes it hard to becoming chummy. Nick is fun, but he's so young and it's more like a Strelow friendship (ah, Madison references).  Dana is great- but we have different worlds I think.   But whatever. What's my point in mourning this year if it's almost over, anyhow? I've made my decision to kickstart a career, and I'm making plans to implement it (although I'd better get started planning a trip to do interviews, STAT). I should be excited and that excitement should be enough to get me to August, right? The truth is, I go between lots of emotions about Texas, most of them positive (a few of them include anxious, shit-my-pants-scared, and apathetic), but I'm having a hard time looking forward and closing the door on the past. I get this feeling of vertigo when I think about my memories, of college, when I look at my pictures and remember the stories behind them. It's like I can look at the pictures and see the people and then in an instant also see where they are now, and where they are going, and how it gets farther and farther apart from me, from the direction I'm going. Jerry's the most obvious example. Bethany and Emily are another. Not only are they on with their own lives apart from mine, they're leaving each other as well.   All this also fuels my relationship with Davis, because I get the feeling we're thinking about the same things and fearing the same outcomes. We both left Madison behind, and we're both vaguely unhappy. What will everyone else feel when they leave it? What's in store for them?   Adam's leaving for Boston in a month, to start over. Megan's moving to Albuquerque. Marisa might be engaged soon. Lots of people ARE engaged. Or married already. I need life to slow down, NOW.   And me, I'm going to Texas. I have no idea what to expect. Never in my wildest dreams would I have guessed I'd end up there. Texas. In the midst of this growing apart of the people I have loved, I get to reconnect with Chris and possibly Jason, and that makes me happier than words can say.   Oh man, you could totally make a Brat Pack movie out of this post. I call Molly Ringwald.

       dreamin'   I had some crazy dreams last night, but in a realistic way (meaning, there were no character shifts, flying monkeys, or blue sheep).   In the first one I was at the Ani concert, only she was doing a roving show, and walking around with her guitar. She stopped by me and we had a conversation, although I don't really remember what it was about. She looked really exhausted, and I wanted to give her a big hug and put her in bed with a bowl of soup.   In the second dream, Jerry wanted us to get married, and I said okay. But after a couple of weeks (in dream speed) I realized that I didn't want to, and when I tried to stop it, I found that everyone but me was making plans for the wedding, and it was going to be a real traditional affair. Not what I wanted. So I went to talk to Jerry about it (who lived, for some reason, with two young Chinese boys in an extremely messy apartment that was mostly staircases with waterfalls pouring down them- okay, that's the crazy part), but he got extremely upset and wouldn't talk to me. He said we were getting married whether I liked it or not! I tried to reason- saying I wanted it to be more like a civil union affair, or a commitment ceremony, and that there was no way in hell I was going to wear three feet of ruffly lace on my ass, but it didn't work. So, I ran off and through myself down the waterfall.   Let that be a lesson to you.

       i cannot believe this, i  cannot  believe this...   Were you in doubt that there is a sexual double standard? That there is an epidemic of sexual assault and abuse on the part of men toward women? That there are some truly scumbag lawyers out there?    urlLink Doubt no longer . Warning: This is a very graphic article; do not read the last half if you are emotionally triggered by acts of rape, violence, etc, or if you just don't want to deal with it. I wish I hadn't read it, but I couldn't tear my eyes away. It just kept getting worse and worse until I felt like I would burst inside.   You know, honestly, I can't even begin to be clear, academic or even focused on this issue, I just want to cry and roll into a ball. I kept imagining how that could have been me, any of my friends, my students...because it is.   And really, lately I've been thinking a lot about the wall of ignorance I came up against in one of the topics at the  urlLink OTJ forum , denouncing feminism, and when I read this I thought, "why do these people want me to be afraid? why do they put down the only thing that's managed to make sense of this hateful world?"  And I what will I do, come Monday, when I go into coach my freshman boys, and look into their eyes and think, "are they capable of this? what are they being taught?"  Who do you trust? How do you live your life? What I wouldn't give to take this girl up into my arms and erase it all away- although, I'm thankful partly that she won't remember it. All she has is her imagination, and the tape, if she could stand to watch it, but what is worse, anyway?   I know he's a lawyer, and he's paid to defend, but I cannot imagine how he can sleep at night. Does he have a daughter? A wife? A mother? Does he detest all of them the way he can so easily pass judgment on a girl he doesn't know, who has visual evidence in her favor? Perhaps it is easy for him, because that's how he feels about women as well. Is he capable of this? What was he taught?

       joining the new wave of...something or other   Having heard some good things about Mozilla's  urlLink Firefox  browser, I decided to give it a try (why not, eh? it's free to download, my internet connection is ridiculously fast, and i'm always looking for new ways to stick it to the corporate man).   It's pretty dang sweet.  So far, my favorite feature is that you can open new windows in tabs that appear at the top of the window, thus axing the need for lots of browser windows clogging up your navigation bar thingy (whatever you call the dohicky at the bottom of your screen). They also have nifty themes, so currently my buttons are purple. heee!! So far most sites look great, no problems with colors or line-up or anything.   Been thinking idly about building my own computer when I get to Dallas, and attempting to free myself from most Microsoft products.  I'm not entirely sure what that will entail, but I've got time to do research anyhow. Included in my research will be web design and more complicated blogging tools that will get me set up in a comfy space of my own.   Off topic but exciting, one of the schools Chris told me to take without second thoughts contacted me for teaching and marching band tech positions (Plano). I so rock.   I am both honored and bashful that the folks at  urlLink Feministing  have linked me, considering I infrequently do political/feministic posts these days.  It makes me happy that I have a picture of blue Tara on my sidebar. Here's what HH the DL (that sounds like a hip-hop name, word) has to say about Tara:  There is a true feminist movement in Buddhism that relates to the goddess Tara. Following her cultivation of bodhicitta, the bodhisattva's motivation, she looked on those striving toward full awakening and she felt that there were two few people who attained Buddhahood as women. So she vowed, "I have developed bodhicitta as a woman. For all of my lifetimes along the path I vow to be born a woman, and in my final lifetime when I attain Buddhahood, then I, too, will be a woman."

        urlLink EEEEEP!!    So, I check out the Ani D tour page over at  urlLink Righteous Babe  every so often, although it infrequently changes. Listed there is a show in Flagstaff, AZ, that would be feasible for me to drive to if I could find a like minded soul willing to make a roadtrip. So I head on over to Ticketmaster to check out prices, when I find that...she's going to be here. In San Diego. Fuck.   July 27th- and tickets go on sale Friday. They are reasonably inexpensive. I would go by myself and sit swaying in the audience feeling marvelous but I thought it would be nice to invite a friend, so I called Natalie.   I figure, if I have to be in Dallas August 2nd, July 28th is the absolute latest I can leave, which means I'll be there around the 30th. That gives me 2 days to get settled in and figure things out. It's fast, and scary, but I'm trying to think of it like moving away to college and having to get adjusted to things quickly. Besides, if I go too early, I'll run out of money reeeeeal quickly. This means I can stick around here and work until I leave.   It's a perfect goodbye present, given from me to myself, to say adieu to San Diego and prepare to meet the new challenges. Ani! Yay!   Okay, I know I've been super starstruck for weeks and weeks but I promise I'll chill out soon. Maybe.

       your random lauren goodness, for monday   It must be something in the water: All three of my private swim lessons today were cancelled due to sickness. At first I thought this was a remarkable coincidence, then I remembered that Lorin and Dana have both been sick since last week, and THEN I started to feel a little scratchy-throat ickiness. Plus headache, plus lack of energy= unhappy Lauren. Popping the echinacea, and the Halls Defense.   I'm very disappointed that they took out the fun curvy right turn ramp that took you conveniently from Twin Peaks Rd to Community Rd. It's just your average whitebread right turn lane now, dime a dozen. It made my trip to Henry's all the more fun, and plus, who among us can say that swoopy ramp driving is not the best part of having a license? I can't; I still get excited when I get on the 78 from the 15 and go over the fun roller coaster bridge. When I find a new off/on ramp with that particular  je ne sais quoi , that I have not previously enjoyed, I get positively giddy. I'm so weird.  I love that I can buy everything I usually get, plus a handful of impulse buys, at Henry's and still manage to keep the tab under $55. All the fresh, organic veggies you could want, plus bulk cereal, plus the best cranberry juice around, plus super good Colby Jack cheese, plus low fat flour tortillas= very content and well-fed Lauren (for several weeks).   I always seem to be at Henry's at the same time as the "Heart Starts Beating at Eight Weeks" bumperstickered car lady.   Not having swim lessons today meant that I: -Washed my car (it's going to  urlLink rain ) -reorganized my room and folded clothes (wow!) -cleaned my bathroom -paid my bills -cashed my tax refund and paycheck -lounged -washed sheets and towels -lounged more -napped.   urlLink 91X , stop playing that bloody  urlLink "Mexican Radio"  song. I get it. You broadcast out of Mexico. It's cheaper. That's why you have the Spanish lady in between commercials, and why you play the Mexican national anthem at midnight. Along with, might I add, every other goddamn radio station in San Diego.   Also, you are not the "cutting edge of music" if you are owned by Clear Channel. You're trying hard, I admit, and you're playing some hip stuff, but stop fooling yourself. Take a tip from  urlLink 94.9 ; once I heard them play Bjork. And Tori Amos. Although, I have to admit their "It's about the music" commercial gets on my nerves like crazy. Why are all these radio stations so damn proud of themselves?   Pad thai, or mixed veggie stir fry? Such a dilemma.

       teaching   I will admit, I was a little nervous I'd just made the decision to move to Dallas last week, and start up building a private studio. I've never been there, I've never taught privately (unless you count swim lessons), and I feel like I would have to do a lot of work, research, and practicing to get into shape to be the best instructor I can be.   But I have to relax. When I go into my schools to coach I can do some fine teaching, and I see myself getting more adept at communicating new or different ideas each time. I love the short, friendly interaction, me and a handful of students, that going in weekly to coach provides me with, because it's similar to what I liked about Blue Lake. I'm not the full time teacher, so disciplinary issues are not my jurisdiction, and I'm not responsible for grades either. This leaves me off the hook, so to speak, of stress, and allows me to really dig and teach these kids some fun stuff. I can try out educational experiments, teach avant-garde techniques, and play around with different instrument combinations. I've felt throughout this year that I would be stellar at private instruction, because I have more ease one-on-one socially anyhow. Coaching groups was hard at first- but I love it now. I would like to get the same kind of feel for private teaching.   This means I need to start a new regime of self-instruction, including picking up some texts on educational techniques, practicing my basic skills, and seeking out specific trombone knowledge. I'm tempted to rent a euphonium or tuba, and fiddle around on that to get more of a feel for how to teach the instrument.   I talked to Chris on the phone yesterday, and it turns out if I'm hired to help out with marching band, I'll have to be in Texas before August 2nd. This means I'm aiming to be out of San Diego the last week of July, and take three days to get to Dallas (be advised, Megan, this means I will be spending a day with you in Albuquerque ;). I'm thinking about aiming to arrive the same day Chris comes down from Wisconsin, so that he'll have access to a car until he can get one of his own. Once there it'll just be unpacking, organizing, and getting ready for the job, plus hunting around town for an organic grocery store, and some killer veggie restaurants (according to a fact sheet I read on Dallas, it has more restaurants per capita than New York City). I'll also need furniture.   I'm super excited- finally, I get to start planning for my fall adventures instead of sitting around here feeling lost and lonely. Even the technical, boring stuff excites me, like health insurance and car registration issues.   First things first, though, I need to plan a trip to Texas to do my interviews and select my schools. Can I get a wOOt?

       sweet zombie jesus!    urlLink Blogger  got all weird and fancy on me. Three years of the same thing, and this crazy format nearly gave me a heartattack just now.   This is just not something you can do to us Cancers. We like our change slow, deliberate, if at all. It's like coming into my crab shell and moving the furniture around! Eep!  The one thing I'd wish they'd do, is make it so you can view individual posts when you click on the permalink. All the more reason to move on to the bigger and more hands-on weblog tools, I guess.   EDIT: Oh, look at that. They did. I'm playing with the fun new templates but I can't figure out why my profile/links/archives are all down there at the bottom. Help!   EDIT EDIT: I'm a genius! The stuff that is missing from my old page will be up shortly. I need to shower now; I'm stinky and gooey from sunblock lotion.

       can you hear the gnashing of my teeth?   Another two things theme, but this time they are not happy.   1.  urlLink Women and girls have been deemed too stupid to use the morning after pill  over the counter.   The Food and Drug Administration told the pill's maker, Barr Pharmaceuticals, that before the drug could be sold without a prescription the company must either find a way to prevent young teenagers from getting it from store shelves or prove, in a new study, that young girls can understand how to use it without the help of a doctor.   Is it just me or is there an inherent contradiction between those two demands? "We don't want teenagers to use it, but if they can prove they're smart enough, then I guess they don't deserve to be pregnant."   [Via  urlLink Feministing ]  2. Well, women are pretty stupid, but that doesn't stop them from being evil and manipulative.  urlLink Sorry, we're responsible for the abuse of Iraqi prisoners.  Oh, and feminists too.   Linda, Linda, Linda:  But one factor that may have contributed -- but which I doubt investigators will want to even consider -- is whether the presence of women in the unit actually encouraged more misbehavior, especially of the sexual nature that the pictures reveal   I missed the part where all men became gentle, caring, prudent, asexual wimps. I really did.   George Neumayr:  The image of that female guard, smoking away as she joins gleefully in the disgraceful melee like one of the guys, is a cultural outgrowth of a feminist culture which encourages female barbarians. GI Janes are kicking around patriarchal Muslims in Iraq? This is [Feminist Majority Foundation president] Eleanor Smeal's vision come to life. Had Thelma and Louise gone off to Iraq -- and sexually humiliated some of Saddam Hussein's soldiers as payback for abuse to Jessica Lynch a few cities back -- the radical feminists could make a sequel.   This sounds a lot like the attitude I ran into in the  urlLink Is Chivalry Dead?"  thread over at the OTJ. (as one poster told me: "Radical feminists, affirmative action zealots, and other such "activists" do not want "equal treatment" they want "superior treatment"" No. I just want shit like this to stop fucking happening.)  And in case feminists and women didn't do enough:   It is Muslims' fault. They took trillions of dollars in oil money, and instead of building a culture dedicated to elevating their people, including women, they have squandered it on agendas and adventures that had the opposite result.   Put your thang down, flip it and reverse it, my oh my doesn't that sound like America.   [Via  urlLink Feministe ]

       things are, like, looking up, omigod!   Two things:   I've decided that, even if I get in, I don't want to go to McGill. I've sent them several emails requesting the status of my admission, asked questions of the professor, and left a phone message a two, NONE of which I've gotten answers for. The phone message and the emails to the admissions office do not bug me as much the fact that Prof Box has not responded to any of my queries, or even to my thank you note for the lesson. He's an awesome guy, and it sounds like he has a great studio, but I'm not sure I want to go through another session of schooling second-guessing my professor. If at some point I decide to reapply for graduate school, I'm looking for a professor who's going to be committed to my musical growth and not ignore me. A couple of other factors have led to my decision not to wait for McGill, and I'm still not sure that I'll be accepted.   That said, I went ahead and sent off emails to the various band directors in Texas that Chris provided me information for. Immediately, I got a response from one band director, followed by two others a while later, all positive, all requesting more information from me. One guy was extremely excited I knew Chris, and it seems that his good example has set a positive precedent for me. Thanks Chris! (Thanks also for the email full of exclamation points :)   So, something worked the way I wanted it to, for once. It looks like I'll be going to Dallas in the fall, maybe sooner depending on when Chris is moving and when the jobs here want to let me go. This is a good thing- I'll be immersed in music and trombone playing which means I might feel a little more excited about it. Even if I'm not, I'll have a source of income and a springboard from which to seek out other jobs I might be interested in having, dealing with feminism/activism and such. In the past couple of weeks my teaching experiences have been such that I realized I really enjoy it. Really. I've become invested in the success of my current students and the feedback from the directors has been all positive. Each day teaches me something new, and I'm becoming more adept at translating concepts into actions.   The other thing:   I have received in the mail today, 8 months late (but more than making up for it), my "birthday present" from Jerry.   The Complete Futurama Season Two DVD set. 19 episodes, at least 10 of which I've NEVER seen, replete with the hilarious David Cohen/Matt Groening audio commentary, deleted scenes, and other goodies that I cannot wait to discover this evening. Four discs of Futurama goodness. Lots of Richard Nixon jokes. I'm so set on entertainment value for the next week.   Thanks Jerry!

       the stuff tuesdays are made of   Of course, first of all, HAPPY BIRTHDAY JERRY! Try not to spend this one sleeping naked in the bathroom.   Because  urlLink Ms Lauren  is always raving about Derrick Jensen, I had a copy of  urlLink The Culture of Make Believe  transferred to my library branch. Holy balls is that thing thick! I'm going to have to renew that sucka eight times. First I have to finish  Promiscuities .   I taught swim lessons today for the first time in four years. It was rough, not so much that it went badly, but that I'm not used to little little kids and water and trying to keep them from drowning and teaching them to blow bubbles all at the same time. I'm exhausted.   Too lazy to link to it right now, but a user on livejournal is real-life meming by requesting mixed CDs of all women artists, inspired by the March for Women's Lives. I'm tearing through my collection now, trying to come up with a theme (besides the fact that they are chicas). It's proving more difficult than I thought it would, as my tastes are rather eclectic and the women represent that. Do I do a folk/rock CD? A soul/R&B/jazz dealie? Punk/indie? Or just mash them all together and theme it by song or topic?   Speaking of CDs, I'd forgotten how reasonably priced the albums at Circuit City are. I got Fever To Tell (Yeah Yeah Yeahs) for a measely $10 and the Donnas new album, Spend the Night, for $12. Hurray!  Totally braindead from the water and sun and little screaming children. I must tear myself away from this utterly pointless blog now. Now.

       SEX!   I'm reading Naomi Wolf's  urlLink Promiscuities: The Secret Struggle for Womanhood , and have been thinking lately about my own experiences growing up and learning about sexuality and sensuality.   Wolf's book is a look, part memoir, part speculation, at how growing up in the licentious 70s during the sexual revolution in San Francisco shaped her opinions and actions about sexuality. Torn between the dichotomy of virgin and whore that lingers despite the best feminist efforts to kill it off for good, and the freedom of experimentation that enveloped the era, Wolf and her friends grew up in a world of confusion surrounding female desire. It excellently ties in with the more scientific research of Leora Tanenbaum's  urlLink Slut! Growing Up Female with a Bad Reputation .   While I can't identify with the time or the place that is the setting for Wolf's adolescence, her evocation of the slut/virgin standard reminds me of my own experiences. Lucky for me,  urlLink California is one of the more progressive states  regarding access to sex education and contraceptive information. Thus, brief as it was (I think only two weeks of one semester every year or so were dedicated to sex ed), I got proper and medically correct information about how sex works, how pregnancy works, and how diseases are transmitted. Obviously absent was any knowledge about female pleasure (but then again, male pleasure wasn't covered either, although we got plenty of that knowledge in day-to-day conversation), but at least I wasn't hit over the head with abstinence and religion.   That said, I had the scientific education, but where did I stand emotionally? What  did  I think of sex? I didn't get abstinence education from school, but I sure as hell got it from my parents. Well, my mom. It was very bottom line: sex is an adult thing, and don't even dare skirting the issue. Dating for me began at 15, although I didn't really date anyone anyway, so that wasn't a big deal. Honestly, I never felt like I could even approach my parents about sex, like, they've said what they expect of me and to even think about bending the rules would be blasphemy. When I got my period for the first time, it seemed to come as a big shock for my mom. For me, it was no big deal and I was glad I finally got it (I was sick of watching those feel-good, pink frilly videos called "Who Am I Now" or "Your Changing Body"). But for my mom, it was a wake-up call that I was vulernable to the unavoidable sexual culture surrounding us.   My youngest memory of sex is this: My best friend, Katie, lived across the street from me until 7th grade when she moved to Tennessee. We had sleepovers almost every weekend, and Katie, being much more advanced in the knowledge of such matters than I, frequently brought up the topic of sex. Either our Barbie and Ken would get passionate in the back of the convertible (despite their lack of genitals, they seemed to enjoy it) while we supplied the soundtrack of grunts and moans, or we'd huddle in our sleeping bags clasping my larger stuffed animals to ourselves pretending to do something we actually knew nothing about. They were always our husbands, and they always initiated it (Fivel was my hubby. Not bad for a mouse ;). I went along with this, but really I had no idea what was going on.   Prudish as I might have been in high school, in reality my mentality just wasn't ready for sex of any kind yet. It was hazy, in the distance, and I knew for certain I didn't want it. My girlfriends and I giggled conspiratorily over George Michael songs and MTV programs, but they were forbidden, and it was exciting.  Dating Dave was a bit of a wake-up call. Kissing, touching, these were all good things and I had no qualms about them. I didn't dig the whole boob-fondling thing at all- that made me extremely uncomfortable. I was almost more relaxed about the stuff below the belt than what happened to my breasts. Such close contact with a person obviously interested in me both sexually and emotionally had its effect- I began to see sex as something a little clearer, a little more desirable. There was no lack of opportunities; Dave's parents were never home when we were done with school so it was easy enough to fool around and not worry. He was extremely respectful and attentive, and I can't deny our relationship was great fun. I had no worries about compromising my reputation or my relationship by holding back. So, I did want to make that step with Dave on one level, because I knew it would be safe, but I couldn't do it, really. The more I became aware of my own sexuality, the more the world around me started to reveal the double standards and distaste that surrounded women's sexual experience. I was afraid now, of sex with Dave, because I saw what was happening to the girls around me that did go "all the way." I didn't think I could live with myself, or even respect my own decisions, if I agreed to do this. Social conditioning, perhaps, but I didn't know that at the time.   However, I can't reprimand myself for waiting. God knows, we can't start doing that. I'm proud that I couldn't be sweet-talked, or coerced, into doing anything I didn't want. I just wish the atmosphere had been more friendly, more open to my desires for knowledge. Hell, I didn't really know anything about the clitoris until my freshman year roommate, Sarah, got a book called "The G Spot" and I would surrepitously leaf through the pages desperate to learn all this that I'd been denied for so long. Living with Davis was a tremendous bonus, too, what with her Guide and her openness about such matters. Finally, I felt like I could have sex and enjoy it, understanding all the aspects of both society and science that go into our perceptions of it. Perhaps I would have felt the whole issue was easier in high school if I'd known more and been prepared to deal with it.   That being said, I'd like to hear what my generation learned about sex. Whether you went to high school with me or not, how did your perceptions about sexuality affect your adolescence? What were your experiences? Mine are limited, and condemned by the burden of my hazy memory. If you have a blog, write it there, and trackback. Or just leave a comment. C'mon, I know you all want to talk about sex. Baby.

       it's bloody hot    urlLink Ugh.   It's like walking out onto a parking lot in the desert with the fumes rising up from the blacktop and the wind just making it worse because it's blowing warm air in your face.   That's right. It's blacktop hot.   Looks like tomorrow it'll go back to being spring. Thank goodness- I'm not yet prepared for a southern California summer after four years of adjusting to the humidity and fickle-temperatured Midwest. There ain't thunderstorms out here to cool you off every other week, folks, it's just plain HOT all the time.   Not that I mind it. I love HOT. Love it. Because my birthday's in the dead center of it all, in the middle of beach-season, dark-room-lying around, sweating like crazy over your beer on the backporch weather. And my birthday, as we all know, is a special event.   It's just that...I like spring too, and I'm not ready to give up the flawless 75 degree days feeling fresh and frisky. I'm not ready to be sluggish and languid. Not yet. I've still got to buy summer clothes, shorts and skimpy tops. Flowy hippy skirts. Give me another month, please, San Diego. Just one more month.

       boy, do i have a drinking story for you   Jack Black: Class, do you know what a hangover is? Kid: Yeah, it means you're drunk. Jack Black: No, it means I was drunk...yesterday.   This one goes down in history as the weirdest, scariest, most hilarious night of drinking I have ever had.   Adam and I drove ourselves down to Hillcrest to do a little binging, starting out at a place called Hamburger Mary's. Two margaritas, one Midori Sour, one Vodka Cran, and an Amaretto Sour later, we were at this sketchy-ass gay bar in which the female population totaled four, myself included. I am so wasted at this point that I don't seem to care that I am ridiculously out of place and continue to dance floppily to whatever 50 Cent song they were playing (the irony of 50 Cent being played in a gay bar was not lost on me, however). Eventually, after downing some poor kid's waterbottle without their knowledge, and perhaps without mine as well, I decide I must go outside to get some air.   Mistake. The line to get in is outrageously long and immediately the bouncer refuses to let me back in, as I am "too drunk, sweetheart." Adam's still in there, and with him his car keys which will unlock my cell phone, wallet, and trip home. I have no cash left. In other words, I am royally screwed. Dejectedly, I sit outside on this planter mumbling nonsense to myself and hoping, praying, demanding that Adam come out immediately to rescue me. However, Adam is dancing with the gay men and is also too drunk to realize that I am missing. My boobs are not important here. I am an invisible woman (for the first time, and annoying, in this case).   I try a few more fruitless attempts at getting back in, and finally the only thing I can think of to do is head back to Adam's truck. My right shoe has created a gigantic and deep blister on the ball of my foot, and at some point, the skin has begun to tear away. So, inbetween trying to act like a)I wasn't shit-faced beyond belief and could walk in a straight line, b) not toss my cookies, and c)figure out where the FUCK I am in bloody Hillcrest, where I have gotten lost EVERY SINGLE TIME I've been there (and that's sober), I'm limping like crazy and in severe pain.  I make it to the truck, and climb in the bed in hopes that Adam will not be long in coming so that we can get our asses in a cab and pass in the comfort of a place with walls. No such luck for me...I spend a fair amount of time alternating between trying to convince the passersby that I belong in this truck and not to have me arrested for vagrancy and launching some sort of diatribe about how fucked-up anti-choice protests are. Eventually I curl up into a fetal position and try not to freeze my ass off. At some point someone gave me a blanket, which at the time was a very nice gesture but in retrospect I wonder how long they'd been watching me.   When I wake up, it's 6:30 am, the sun's coming up, and there's still no sign of Adam. I'd been hoping it was all a dream, but no- I have the blanket, I'm dirty as fuck from lying in the bed of a truck all night, and I'm sure I look like a hobo. I'm relieved that, although I slept outside on a busy street in a big city, I appear to have been left alone. This might be due to the fact that once I got the blanket, I covered myself from head to toe and trying to appear as cargo-like as possible. My bank's nearby- I think to go there and get out some cash for a cab ride. Oh, it's Sunday. The only phone number I know by heart I can call collect is my parents...and I'd like to leave that for the last possible minute.   At 8:30, I see Adam appear around the corner. He spots me and starts running, while I just stand there and shake my head. His story is almost as crazy as mine- after getting kicked out of the club he walked 30 blocks to his boyfriend's house and was lucky enough to be let in by his roomate and sleep in a bed. His wrist is all fucked up- bringing our drinking casualties to 2. Now that I'm safe and warm, and Adam and I have found each other, we're laughing hysterically. I can't believe this all happened to me. I fucking slept in a truck in the middle of Hillcrest! God damn, that's funny.   I feel like crap-ola today. I want to eat all the junk food and big fatty hamburgers I can get my hands on, and then some Snickers. I can't really walk very well, because my blister is the size of China and I can't put any weight on it. My head is pounding.   Have I learned my lesson not to drink so much and wander off in a strange neighborhood?   Yeah, next time I'll take my cell phone with me.   [For more drinking hilarity, amuse yourself  urlLink here ]

       foul mood   I'm tired, crabby, enraged, depressed, and the last thing I want to do is blog. I've been feeling like this for several days now, so I might not be around much. My inspiration is low and right now I feel like the most boring, least original, worst blogger on the planet.   I also feel increasingly out of touch (and sad) with all y'all that read here- especially my UW friends. Seems awfully quiet.   Also, I have so little energy to care. I'm sorry. Give books to Pamie. See you in a week or two.

       the heat's rising   Just wanted to say that I saw  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  yesterday, at a 11:45am matinee show that was packed.  urlLink Jerry  does a good job of summing up my sentiments. I can't say that it didn't tell me much that I didn't already know, but it put it all together in a fashion that had me crying at the end.   And you should go listen to Ani's poem  urlLink Self-Evident  (under So Much Shouting/So Much Laughter) if you want even more perspective and righteous anger at the man who would be president.  One more thing: Check out  urlLink this comic  by Lalo Alcatraz. It's quickly becoming one of my favorite reads of the day.    The final quote from the movie:   There's an old saying in Tennessee  I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee  that says, fool me once, shame on [long pause]-- shame on you. Fool me- [even longer pause, you can see the smoke coming out of his ears as the wheels turn faster]-- you can't get fooled again.  George W. Bush, Nashville, Tenn., Sept. 17, 2002

       a thinking woman's meme   A week or two ago Roxanne at  urlLink Rox Populi  posted an  urlLink Open Thread on Feminism  that I've been meaning to respond to ( urlLink Ms Lauren  and  urlLink Kate  reminded me). Here it be, finally.   1. Define "feminism" Feminism is a way of making sense of the world and its inequalities, not just those dealing with women but those of other cultures, ethnic backgrounds, and class. Honestly, I think feminist thought drives a majority of the change in the world, even if it isn't distinctly defined as feminist.   On a basic level, feminists say that women are the intellectual equals of men and deserve to be treated as such. Feminism is an effort to change the factors of our social environment that keep the woman down, so to speak.   2. Was you mother a feminist? I don't think she would use the term (a long time listener of Rush "Feminazis Want to Eat My Brain and Have Satanic Rites" Limbaugh) but I know she subscribes to the basic tenets of feminism: women are equals, women should not shoulder the burden of housework, etc. I was raised to be very independent and street smart; it wasn't until I hit puberty that she set in with the standard notions of gender roles (copies of  The Rules , invocation of Dr Laura style chastisement) which I fought hard against.   3. Are you a feminist?  urlLink Yes . I give you all collective permission to stare at my chest.   4. When did you come to that conclusion (#3) and what factors entered into your decision? A confession I have to make: Years of secondhand listening to Rush in high school (I hated him, but my impressionable mind still picked up some of his verbal diarrhea) and witnessing my father's own feminist-bashing caused me to be one of those "I'm not a feminist, but..." girls. Tenacious and competitive, I knew I was just as good as the boys and I hated gender injustice. In swimming, band (how can you be a girl trombonist and not be a feminist, even a closet one?), and academics, I overacheived. I was raised to be that way, of course, but I often took it as a personal cause to prove my gender's capabilities.  Only in college, after maybe two days of Women's Studies 102, did I actually apply the term to myself.   5. What are the top five women's issues that require immediate attention? AIDS and family planning in third world countries (ditch the Global Gag rule and reinstate US aid to UNFPA); rescinding of laws that restrict abortion in the US; proper sex education and the elimination of the sexual double standard; regulation of global trade and companies with sweatshops- most of those workers are women and children; insuring that, whatever the hell we are doing in Iraq, we make it a safe place for women to walk the streets again.

       san diego libraries need you!    urlLink Pamela Ribon , author of the incredibly hilarious  Why Girls Are Weird , screenwriter, comedian, blogger extraordinaire, urges you to help out the San Diego County Public Libraries with a book drive. Many libraries have Amazon wishlists, and especially need children's books. Last year she did the same book drive with the Oakland Library system, to tremendous success.   You can also give donations to the  urlLink San Diego Public Library Foundation . From the  urlLink The Library Journal:   A proposed FY 05 $37.7 million budget for the San Diego Public Library, tentatively approved City Council, would be $204,642 less than last year, which means the system would close seven library branches on Sundays, cut materials, and reduce hours elsewhere. According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, the budget for salaries and benefits has increased $2.15 million, so the library will eliminate 20 positions from the budget. One councilman proposed private donations to keep the branches open. The city is trying to balance the budget by cutting $26.9 million in funding for parks, recreation centers, libraries, community centers, police storefronts and a child care program. The council must approve the budget by June 28.  Pamie's entry can be found  urlLink here . She's holding a contest this year:  And this year I'll throw in a prize. Three donors will receive one signed copy of my book sent to their home. Contest runs until July 25th, one month from today. I'll have stee draw three names at random from every donor to the San Diego County Public Library System through their wishlists. I'll post the three winners names here on pamie.com on July 25th. Good luck!  This is close to home, and the libraries here are dear to me- especially Rancho Bernardo, which has helped me get through this year with plenty of reading and listening material. I'll be taking the time before I leave for Dallas to go through my book collection and see if there isn't anything on a wishlist, or if there is a book dear to me that I feel someone else would benefit from as well. Take the time to read Pam's entry, and think about it- you can get cheap used/new/resale books through  urlLink Amazon.com  for oftentimes under $10.

       musings on billy joel   Listening to my newly acquired Billy Joel album brings back some dusty memories. Step into the wayback machine with me, if you will. Picture Lauren, aged 13, rocking out to the copy of  Stormfront  her crazy-but-cool uncle Paul gave her during her last visit to Wisconsin.   Now, that's some quality music for a 13 year old (admittedly I was a Billy Joel fan  urlLink long before  that, without knowing it). The delightfully overplayed "We Didn't Start the Fire," the hauntingly sad story of overfished waters in "The Downeaster, 'Alexa'," the rock apology "I Go to Extremes," the touching tribute to international relations "Leningrad," the slow tempo "And So It Goes," the tempestuous title track, and the song that is the inspiration for this post, "Shameless."  The album I bought today,  The Stranger , is young Billy ca 1977, and his voice, while recognizable, doesn't have the fully matured vocal quality of 1989's  Stormfront . Occasionally I'd hear a lilt that reminded me of a feeling I've long forgotten: the feeling I used to get listening to Billy sing "Shameless" at age 13. It was my first experience with sensuality, with arousal.   I had the biggest crush on Billy Joel. I had no idea what he looked like (this is long before the internet, remember, and I had a bootleg copy of the album), or what his other albums sounded like, or even his life story or personal behavior. None of this mattered, because when he sang "Shameless" I was just that- I'd be bouncing around on my bed singing at the top of my lungs to "I Go To Extremes" but when it was over I'd lie down on the floor and let his voice wash over me (no naughty thoughts now- masturbation was a dirty word to me back then). It was like waves of heat, or cold, but you never know which. It left me weak and satisfied. A musical orgasm, if you will. I haven't listened to the song before writing this post, but I don't need to because I can still hear the way his voice cracks when he says "I'm shameless baby/I don't have a prayer/anytime I see you standing there/I go down upon my knees" and it makes me shudder still. I've gone on to have my little love affairs with other people's vocal tics, sure, but you never forget your first love.   In high school my section leader, Aaron, turned out to be a walking encyclopedia of Billy knowledge, including having the talent to play a majority of the repetoire on piano. He had (has? recently I heard he's playing open mics in town) a nice voice and we used to sneak into a practice room at Palomar college during lulls in rehearsals with the youth orchestra and he'd take requests. I'd ask for "Lullaby," or "Blonde over Blue."  I was wise enough to not request "Shameless," knowing not only that no one could do it better, but also that I couldn't afford to love anyone who could sing to my heart like that. Yet.   I haven't turned out to be a Joelhead, or whatever, the only albums I own are  Stormfront ,  River of Dreams  (for which I did wait diligently to arrive in stores), and now,  The Stranger . These days I have to be in the mood and a little nostalgic to listen; he seems a little dated. Not to say some of his songs aren't timeless, but maybe just that I feel I'm not that innocent anymore. Rock is different now, a little dirtier. Billy stays in that young part of my head, singing to that tweenager just learning what love feels like.   What about you? Who did you fall in love with at age 13?

       ooh, she's thrifty, she's just my type   Having cancelled my swim lessons for the afternoon (I have completely lost my voice, which always happens to me when I get colds- although I fought the cold, teaching swim lessons in a loud environment ripped up my already weak vocal chords), I wandered over the Poway SA store to do a little thrifting. I didn't find anything in the clothes section that appealed to me (I've never been one for thrift store clothes anyway). There was a blue velour couch that rocked my world- shame there's no way I can get it to Texas.   I made out like a bandit in the LPs section. You know, LP shopping is give and take- you have to look out for scratches, ripped or damaged covers, the right record in the folder. There were some gems there I wanted to take home (mostly classical, some Elton John) but the actual records were MIA. I did get:   Herb Alpert and the TJ Brass,  Going Places  Billy Joel,  The Stranger  Chopin, Nocturnes, etc... Brahms, Piano Concerto No 2 Grieg, Piano Concerto in A minor,  Peer Gynt  Suite  I salvaged some books too:   Germaine Greer,  The Female Eunuch  Garrison Keillor,  Lake Wobegon Summer 1956  EM Forster,  A Room with a View   All these for under $8, which totally justifies my butchering of Beastie Boys lyrics.   Reviews forthcoming. I'm currently rereading  Their Eyes Were Watching God  by Zora Neale Hurston. I read it when I was young, maybe 15, and I hated it. I think it was partly the vernacular speech she uses. That kind of thing no longer bothers me, so I'd like to give it another shot and see if I can appreciate it to the full extent it deserves.

       do your good deed for the day   Schwarzenegger is taking a poll on same-sex marriage. To participate, you can call the governor's office at:  916 445 2841.   Select 5 to get to "Hot Issues", 1 for same-sex marriage, and 1 again to support it. Doesn't seem to be any restriction on what state you live in, but if you're in California, definitely do it.   Quick, easy activism you can do sitting down! :)

       oh, brother   Before  urlLink Adam  left for Boston he gave me his copy of  urlLink Skipping Towards Gomorrah:   The Seven Deadly Sins and the Pursuit of Happiness in America  by Dan Savage, of Savage Love fame.   Here's what Dan has to say about the very place I am moving to in less than two months:   Plano is the ugliest place I visited while working on this book. Hell, Plano is the ugliest place I've ever been to, and I've been to a lot of ugly places, from mud-brick villages in southern Egypt, to crumbling, Stalinist apartment blocks on the edges of Moscow, to Gary, Indiana.  Worse than Gary, Indiana? Okay, I been to neither Moscow nor Egypt, but I have been through Gary and I can say safely that Plano has more charm that that. I understand the sentiment, though, because I hand-picked my apartment complex for the bike trail and creek behind it knowing I'd be desperate for a nature getaway in the middle of Square Grid Suburbia, USA.  Planning on spending  urlLink Halloween in Austin , and next year's  urlLink ITA Convention  in New Orleans.   Oh, and most importantly, I will be in New York next Labor Day for a wedding. Congratulations, Marisa and Dennis! EEEEEE!

       good news should come in threes. what's next?   Chris and I were approved for the totally rockin' apartment in Plano. I can't wait- I plan on painting the walls and I just bought two big Ani D posters for decoration. There will be a kitty, possibly named Sergei (Prokofiev) or Begemot (after the Cat in  urlLink The Master and Margarita ).   Despite my bitching about work, I got a fifty cent raise today. While this is all well and good (and particularly nice), I still feel like there's too much need to ass-kiss. I'm just doing my job, don't make me feel like a twelve year old.   Something else good ought to happen, to round it out to three.   As Davis always does, here is my countdown to major events: 4 days til payday 23 days til Marisa comes to visit 33 days til my birthday ( urlLink hint ) 40 days til the big move 150ish days til the possibility of visiting Jerry in New York arises (Thanksgiving)

       satisfy your inner geek   A new museum has  urlLink  opened in Seatle . Ladies and Gentlemen: the  urlLink Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame .   squee. They even include Futurama:  The museum explores developments in fictional space travel; one of the coolest sections is an interactive, computer-animated display that mimics a space station. Several ships float past, from the Enterprise and the Millennium Falcon to the Planet Express of the cartoon TV show "Futurama." Visitors can view images of the ships from any angle, learn about their dimensions and features, and see clips of them in action.   As I am currently unearthing my childhood love of fantasy and science fiction, I am incredibly tempted to make a trip to Seattle just to see this place. Oh, and the rest of Seattle as well.   Also,  urlLink I, Robot  is now a movie, set for release July 16th. I just might have to see that...gee, Will Smith likes his sci fi movies, doesn't he?

       work-related bitching   [Stopping in to say hi. HI! What have I been doing with my time off, you ask? Lots of stuff. Mostly the money-making kind.  Today I am hurtin', bad, from my signature six-mile hike to the waterfall in Los Penasquitos. Normally the walking isn't so bad, but I went with Nick from Frogs, and he likes to climb things, so when we got to the waterfall we also climbed all over the boulders. Quite fun. My shoulders and back are incredibly sore- and tomorrow I'm going kayaking, so I'd better rest up.]  Things are Frogs are starting to piss me off ever so. Nick has been reprimanded and had his shifts taken away for a week because of his climbing over things, etc, and it is, in my opinion, a rather shitty thing to do. Before you punish someone for doing something you don't like, shouldn't you give them a warning first? Also, during his talk in the office with "assistant" Pool Manager and Club Manager they said they were "making an example out of him so that the rest of the guards would step up." That doesn't exactly sit well with me, nor does sit sit well with most of the other guards I've talked to. We all agree that it sucks to have a job where you have to watch your back all the time, and contain aspects of your character that might piss off "assistant" PM (I don't really believe he's assisting- I think he's really in charge despite his title). They seem to be real keen on letting things stew and stew until they can build up some self-justified burst of anger and take away your income.  The guard I worked with on Friday night, Mike C (sweetheart if there ever was one), and I made up a list of improvements we'd like to see the new management at Frogs actually take. They talk big- but I remain skeptical of their ability to actually run the well-oiled lifeguard staff they think they can. For example- it makes me incredibly anxious that I got this job without a watertest, and that everyone else was the same way. Seriously- you could apply to this job, make up a few false LGing jobs, and get it. No interview, no nothing. And even if they're not going to test new hires, they should at least hold inservices once a month. At the "inservice" we did have- all talking, and reading from the manual- "assistant" PM blustered on and on about the need to have hard-working, skilled guards, no mistakes at all. A couple of years back this pool had a drowning- and they're determined it won't happen again. So am I, for that matter, which is why I have a few suggestions for Frogs.  -Bimonthly inwater inservices, with scenarios, lifeguard olympics, team building exercises, and water polo. I want to know the people I'm working with will know to get the backboard when I go in after a spinal, and that they'll know how to work it.  -New equipment including plastic (not wood! too heavy and awkward!) backboard with snaps (not velcro! too weak!, and brand spankin' new rescue tubes, like the kind we had at the Nat with the anti-pick surface (Idle hands destroy the fluffy interior of tubes).  -New shared uniform supplies, including lifeguard parkas and club-bought suits (suits are expensive, and if you're going to have a color/style requirement, you should buy the friggin' things like HCW does), shorts, whistles, and tshirts.  -A more complete and detailed introduction to our specific duties around the pool deck besides surveillance- ie what maintenance we are expected to do, what pool cleaning responsibilities we have, and how to handle chemical emergencies with our specific equipment.  Hell, I should run this bloody pool.  Mike and I wrote these all down, plus a few other issues, that he is going to type up and have the rest of the staff sign to present to PM and CM. I'm thinking about discussing some of these issues (especially the inservice one) with them before it comes to that- because I feel they are extremely important and also that I have sufficient guarding experience to bring to the table and they should make use of it. Now, the management treats their guards like insolent teenagers, beating around the bush when they want you to do something and talking behind your back when they're "concerned" about your performance. I don't need shit like that- I know my job, and I'm there to do it to the best of my ability- tell me what I need to do and I'll do it. In the meantime, trust that I have experiences that lead me to make certain decisions, and they are just as valuable as anyone else's. If you want respect- give it. Dammit.

       just a warning   Lately I'm feeling apathetic about the things I usually love doing- blogging, reading, checking my email- so I might take a little break. If you don't see much of me here don't panic, likely I'll get over it in a few days and come back with some exciting tidbit.   But it's the time to be outside, and to be active. Next Monday I'm going kayaking with Heidi from HCW and soon enough Nick and I are going hiking. Katie and I will be headed to the Martini Ranch on Wednesday night and Shaun's having a graduation party on Saturday.   Don't be fooled by my name dropping- Katie'll be back in Indiana soon enough and Nick's on vacation until after I move. Natalie should be done with school soon, and Dan at that. Never mind me though, I'm just  mentally rounding people up to help me celebrate my birthday.   Only 7 more weeks til the big move. Can't fuckin' wait.

       hero worship   As you all likely know by now,  urlLink Former President Ronald Reagan died today . I celebrate this death because it means the end of long years of suffering for his family, watching someone they loved slip away and leaving an empty shell. My grandmother has Alzheimers- it's a disease that robs you of your soul much like the Spectres in Philip Pullman's  His Dark Materials  trilogy (which you all should read).   While my condolences go to those near to the Reagans, I must at the same time denounce the hero worship that surrounds such a figure. Made legendary by the news media, by politicians, by an American people willing to blind themselves to truth, Reagan really did...what?   Now, this is not a post to shake fingers, to say that he did nothing good for America, because it is impossible for one person to satisfy everyone. I know little about his policies, his presidency- being born the year he was initially sworn into office I spent the blissful ignorance of my childhood in the Reagan era. What reading I have done has cited the mistreatment of women's rights and reproductive freedom by the Reagan administration, and the willful disdain of the AIDS/HIV threat.   My dad asked me today what my thoughts were on President Reagan, and I told him basically what is in the paragraph above. Naturally, I was discounted and harangued with hero worship. Reagan brought down the Berlin Wall (in memoriam, I have watched  Hedwig and the Angry Inch  and dedicated it to Reagan's memory), Reagan created a booming economy.   I know very little about these things. I do know, however, that each person in his or her life does a world of good and a world of bad in the same breath. This CEO gives to charity, but his product is made by third world workers in unliveable conditions. This president speaks of freedom and inspires people to believe in the power of their country, yet enslaves the people of other nations under the same speech.   It's no secret, I think our value systems in this country, in the greater capitalist world, are out of whack. Our priorities ignore lives, our ambition creates poverty in its wake. Each person in power in our society has a duty to uphold that system of power, whether they like it or not. Society is thick and convoluted, and works to set up one shining figure above the rest (or one dark horse, or one evil dictator) that will distract us from the true problems (like birds we are attracted to shiny objects, like cart horses, we wear blinders). Thus, when one of them dies, we bow down and pay homage to the puppet while the director moves unseen.   I choose to break the cycle tonight. There will be no mourning here, except for the countless millions upon billions of people who have died for "freedom", for "economic security", for "moral obligations", for "consumer satisfaction". Reagan is as guilty as Clinton or Bush, or you or I, who do nothing to stop it because we are held back by the bonds of enforced memorial. We are all guilty, we are all dying, and like a sufferer of Alzheimers, we are forgetting.

       sugar water   i think buoyancy is a great word.   it jives rather well with the feeling i have right now...buoyant, content.   and that ani d line: "because humility has buoyancy, and above us only sky..."  the feeling could hold me up in water if it wanted to.   the other word of the day is indignant.  how great it is to be indignant sometimes, how powerful. how anger makes you see some things clearer and others less important- how anger moves you to act beyond your conscious self.   thus earlier this evening i was indignant, and it has given way to buoyancy.   beautiful.

       life lessons learned through the power of trombone   See, I am an amusing drunk, which means you all should take me out for drinks more often.   I have completely and totally wasted this day. I start swim lessons at 3:15, and it would behoove me to straighten my room, practice my trombone, do some yoga, etc., however, I have done nothing except surf the Internet and reread Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.   This is totally in violation of the valuble trombone lesson I had yesterday with Sean Flanigan, professor of trombone at Drake University.   Unprepared as I was, he was understanding and kind, and we worked on a plan for my getting back into shape and preparing myself for graduate school for real. This included him instructing me to get in touch with Jan Kagarice, an adjunct prof of trombone at Univ of North Texas, and to keep in touch with him as he is finishing his doctorate work there. Also using Jason as a connection, this means I have a fairly strong in at UNT, which is exciting to say the least.   I played a little of the Ewazan Sonata for him, and he was kind enough to ignore my technical flaws and focus on the musicality and expression of the piece that could be improved in my rendition. We were talking about the style of Ewazen's music, his neo-romanticness and taste for melody, and I played a little of the smoother sections with what I hoped was my best expression.   Seems like these things always fall a little flat. "Let go" he says, "you know what you want it to sound like but you hold back, why?"   Then he encouraged me to think back on a time that I have let go, and the results I got from it. Immediately I remembered my masterclass performance of the Hindemith- Balls to the wall on that one, I was, at the expense of solid tone and perfect attacks. But I still count it as one of my best performances, because it is one of the few times I can say that I actually did what I meant to do. Round that time of my life I was starting to get a feel for living- actually, honestly living- and I made a resolution that was perfectly expressed by the in-your-face attitude of the Hindemith.   I related this story to Sean and he nodded, saying "you see, you're willing to do this. You've got to live your life that way." He went on to explain that only when we put all our cards on the table do we get a good look at our flaws, and only when we can see them clearly can we begin to fix them. There's no shame in a few cracked notes or a double buzz- I know how to fix those easily- the hardest part is letting go.   Those words ring in my ears today. "You've got to live your life that way"-  that  way. It's time to take risks, and use my head, and take the bad with the good. It's like sitting in Nick's truck yesterday, talking about nothing in particular, and letting his cigarette smoke swirl around my head. I felt dizzy, and happy, and confused- but most of all alive. Itchy for action. Ready to go, get the hell out of Dodge, live large.   Of course it all has to come back to trombone at some point or another, but how else do I learn expression for emotions I've never experienced? If I want my poems to be any good, don't I have to have a launching pad? If I want my recitals to be inspired, I need to know where to begin.   Still, I've done nothing about it today. It might need a little more time to sink in, but it's Friday night, and we'll see what happens. First things first- practice.

       miscellany (my favorite word)   I sat in with the Hidden Valley Middle School band concert tonight, which was fun and brief (the best kind of middle school concert). It was nice of Jeff to say that I was applying and had hopes of going to graduate school, even though he knows that whole deal has gone up in flames. I guess he wasn't sure what else to say about me, since I have no major accomplishments in the music world thus far.  In a strange twist of fate, I have been waitlisted at McGill. However, their letter says they will notify me of changes in "late spring." I think they'd better get on that. Only 20 days left. Too bad I won't be going, or something. I fail to care anymore.  I was not scheduled at all to lifeguard at Frogs for the next two weeks, a fact that has me rather angry and confused. It seems the leadership there would like to play games with the staff, lecturing us about responsibility and work ethic yet failing to keep their own standards high. Also, they are never at the pool. I failed to find Jamie today when I went to teach, and Will could do nothing to help me. I am confident this scheduling error is a misunderstanding (after all, I have been in and out of the area lately), but it comes on the heels of my being left off the staff phone list (because it was a summer list, and they thought I was leaving in June, not July). I'll hold my breath though, for a while, because they've got a long way to go before they get as bad as Rick the Dick.   Bathing suits are expensive, but thankfully HCW is on the ball enough to buy them for us (another beef with Frogs). I invested in this swim/surfing shirt thingy because I am tired of the beach entry at Frogs tearing my suits to shit and giving me the baggy boob effect.   It's summertime in southern California, which means I have dusted off my Sublime CDs. What kind of music do you listen to the most in summer?

        There's a brand new dance...   One of the earliest memories I have, is that of my mother and I at her parents house. My grandparents, as it were. I was young, 3ish perhaps, maybe a little bit older and she was attempting to dress me, or at least have some influence over what I was going to wear. Her insistence was that I wear a 'tummy shirt' or whatever you might call them. you see them today, but only on females and very 'secure' males. They come to just above the navel showing a stripe around the midsection. Today the 'stripe' has grown to epic proportions with the help of the low-rise jean, love it or hate it, they tend to be somewhat sexy. Well, unless your thong is hanging out, or your ass-crack, which, I don't care who you are, is just a tad skeezy. Anyway, these 'tummy shirts,' as I will call them, had a brief popularity in the 80s, but luckily were driven away only to rise again in the near future. The late 90s. Well, to get to the point. I wouldn't wear the shirt. I threw a fit. Try as she might to convince me that it was warm outside and this would keep me cool, seriously, that was her argument, I ran away and cried no. I didn't want to wear it and that day, I got what I wanted. I take this as an early example of fashion sense. I knew that I was going to look stupid, despite the fact that I was three, it didn't matter. It was just going to look like my shirt was too small. Besides, it was the middle of summer, I was a three-year old, why not just slap me with some sunscreen and throw me outside without a shirt? That I could have gone along with. Of course, that was one of the only showings of fashion sense I held. I had in no way, any opportunity to adopt one as my family was poor and you wore what we had. That is, except for ill fitted shirts with horizontal stripes. (loatheing...) As I ventured into college I realized that the times of high school and it's $3 courdory glory as well as the purple shoelace belt, was truely, a thing of the past. I needed to move on, adopt something new that spoke to who I was. Not some disheveled pile of crudeness that wore Bush t-shirts and pants with much to big a hole in the crotch for society to forgive, but instead someone with an idea. It was of course, to be frumpy in highschool. I mean, come on. Puberty anyone? Why not match the confused meanderings of the mind with your coutoure. I dressed how I felt, confused, misunderstood, hapless and uncaring. Though I still hold one or two of those personality traits, I tried my best to overcome the worst, and it produced a change. A new approach. One day you realize that you want to dress like David Bowie, because if anyone has it all together, it's him. One thing I can say for high school, was that my idea of wearing sport coats with casual wear was ahead of it's time. Way to go me. Now of course as I move around the country my mother has invaded my closet and gotten ride of many things that I had that she decided I didn't need anymore. Like an expensive hand me down suit from my Uncle, which, sadly, I probably now fit into once again. All of my sportcoats are long gone as is the shirt that Tom gave me from Saks 5th Ave., which didn't fit him and was the most expensive piece of clothing I had at the time. It actually was quite the ugly shirt though. So, from the past to my beginnings at the Gap in college, trust me, my big sister was freaked out by that for a while, I have come to what I believe is a full circle, innate sense of wanting to look good, feel confident and something else truely insightful here. I must however instill in all of you to dress as you feel. Don't follow the trend, that merely brings pain. Trucker hats, well, they're dumb.

      A time of change is upon a lot of us.&nbsp; As I type this, Lorn is on her way to Texas of all places to begin her new journey as a private trombone teacher. Along with a faithful sidekick, our mutual friend Chris, they will set up their apartment and begin their journey together. Everyone that we went to school with, all of our good friends are scattered now. Germany, Colorado, Maryland, Georgia, Michigan, Illinois, Iceland, Canada the list goes on. It's sad at times. We had all shared such a grand time together and saw a lot of triumphs and tragedys, but all learning expieriences as they unfolded at the University of Wisconsin. I won't get to see them much anymore, me in New york, or wherever I will be in the next week or two. I guess it has come to that time though. More like that obligatory time in high school where everyone gets all sappy and cries and stuff. That never really happened to me. I was ready to get the hell out of their. High school wasn't good or bad, it was just four years where I studied a lot and smoked some weed here and there. It really didn't leave anything profound on me aside from some great long-term friendships I have held. If I took anything away from high school it's that my friend Tim and I, together, have one of the most incredible imaginations. That, and I know how muscles work by the sliding of actin and myosin filaments against each other. Ultimately though, college was the time where I made friends and created those bonds. I am not going to say they were the best times of my life. That would short change the rest of my life, which hasn't happened yet and honestly, I want to have a kick ass life. So, really what I want to say is that from college till death was the best time of my life. I am going to hold everyone to that. Of course there were bad times. Like, when Lauren and I had fights. Or, when Griffin, Ian, Tony and I got in that really weird fight and Griffin got a fat lip two weeks before his recital and I got punched in the head. Not as bad as Griffin, but it really fucking hurt. Oh yeah, there was that crazy 4th of July where Lauren and I got mugged for a lawn chair by a drunk guy and he sprained my wrist. Those were the crappy times. Numerous good times shine through though. So, this has in essence become a very sappy post on the evolution of a post collegiate lifestyle. That, being a fancy way of saying a bunch of artists and shit growing up and trying to make a living at what they think they want to do. Honestly, I ownly hold any sort of fear for the thought of never talking to these people again. I know that we will all be successful when we finally find our niche. It's hard to be afraid when you have just graduated, you have a little money, an idea and nothing to hold you back except the impending fear of student loans. So, really I have just turned this into a big sap-fest. I apologize. When Lorn asked me to guest blog I don't think she wanted this. The last few days have been weird so I will try to work on something utterly hilarious or at least insightful for tomorrow. That way I won't feel like a tool and perhaps someone will recieve some sort of entertainment...or, at least some sex.

       how could i forget?     My official San Diego song is, and has always been, "My Town" by Buck-O-Nine.       i got the tunes in my pocket    in an old ass walkman    walking to the beach    with a bottle of black and tan    keys in the velcro    where it always should be    times tickin' by but it doesn't concern me    i'm killin' time with nothing to do    that's all i seem to think about or do    my soul is sound    when i'm in my hometown    no place i'd rather be       my town, my street    gives me peace of mind    that can't be beat       i can sleep all night    to the sound of the ocean    wake up in the morning    and i do it all again    seven days a week    i pay no attention    i spend alot of time    with my record collection       i heard the sound of a skateboard    rolling down my backstreet    reggae music coming    from the neighbor across from me    as time ticks by    i never stop to ask, i never wonder why    my soul is sound    when i'm in my hometown    no place i'd rather be

        steven's  lauren's last night in town      [I can't sleep. I keep mentally arranging boxes in my car and worrying about minor things that I'll forget to do anyway.]     Heidi from work asked me the other day if I have a "going away" song or album that I will be playing as I leave San Diego, and while I thought it was an excellent question I didn't have an answer for her.     Sublime has a place in my San Diego consciousness that would be fitting, but I'm driving with my mom and I just get the feeling she wouldn't appreciate it as much as I do.     Tom Waits has a song called "San Diego Serenade" that is wildly appropriate, but I don't have a copy of it.      Maybe Ben Folds Five "Steven's Last Night" as my title suggests- but I don't plan on coming back over and over again (sorry, Mikey C) as a joke wearing thin.     Ani D is good for anything, but I think I'll save "Every State Line" for crossing into Texas, and besides, I'll be sad about the concert. I had sort of planned to listen to "Shy" a few times ("I am leaving in the morning, so let's not be shy"), but now I'm not leaving in the morning, besides not having anyone to seduce. Educated Guess would be a good album but I've packed it away.     No to Radiohead, Tori Amos, Fiona Apple, and Blur. Elvis Costello? Eh. How about Bowie "Ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)" huh? Followed by a hearty dose of "Golden Years?"     I know Jerry has a thing for Less Than Jake when he's traveling in and out of La Crosse. Do any of the rest of y'all have a band/song that signifies your departure from a dear place?     Leaving Madison last September I cried buckets.  Coldplay's  A Rush of Blood to the Head , while touching and clearly written for the particular kind of heartbreaking emotional experience I was going through, is not the best choice of music when sharing the road with hundreds of motorcycle fanatics on their way to the Harley Davidson 50th anniversary celebration in Milwaukee.     I don't think I'll be crying buckets this time around; after all, it hasn't been the greatest of times. But I will be sad. I am very much venturing off into the great unknown from a place that has been home to me for many, many years. It's an experience that deserves a fitting tribute, a song or album that will make me think of the feeling in the years to come. What would you choose?

       anticipate     From  urlLink Righteous Babe :    SHOW CANCELLATION  JULY 27TH IN SAN DIEGO    Due to the recent passing of Anis father, she will not being playing at the State Open Air Theater on July 27th. Unfortunately, this show cannot be rescheduled, and refunds will be available at the point of purchase. We apologize for any inconvenience this causes those of you who have purchased tickets and truly appreciate your understanding at this time.     Much love to Ani and her family.  How could you not be sad for Ani, and understand her needs?    I can't help but want to cry a little. This was my big sendoff from San Diego, my farewell present to myself, my soundtrack for the long highway ahead. I've been preparing for weeks by listening almost exclusively to Ani. I've been thinking about it constantly, anxious, on the edge of my proverbial seat.     Because of this my mom and I are leaving tomorrow afternoon instead of Wednesday morning. We're going as far as Tucson, then on to Albuquerque the next day. That will give us a little more leisure time to get there, and more time with Megan. Arrival in Plano still estimated Thursday around 6.     If I don't get a chance to blog tomorrow (I have two swim lessons and a lot of stuff to arrange in my car), this will be it until I a)get internet connection and a computer in Texas (or use Chris's) or b)find a public library to mooch off of. Therefore, I bid you a warm coupla days until I am online again, take care of yourselves and don't do anything I wouldn't do.     Want to guest blog? Send me an email. lahusting AT uwalumni DOT com.

       squirmy with excitement     I talked to Chris today as he was looking through our new apartment looking for things to report to the landlords. I asked him how it was and there was a pause.     "Jesus Christ, it's fucking awesome!"     As we have a loft, the ceilings in the living room go up about 25 feet, which means Chris will be practicing his golf swing. I didn't know Chris golfed. Well, he can take my dad out when he comes to visit.     The management was also cool enough to leave a basket of cookies and toilet paper in the kitchen. I imagine both will be all gone by the time I get there, but it's the thought that counts. I can't fucking wait to see this place. I only saw the model apartment on my trip in May, which was ridiculously nice but then again no one's ever lived in it.  I asked about my shower, as it is a stall and not a tub, because I still have nightmares about our little telephone booth shower at the Henry house.  It's not that small, thankfully.  I'm reminded of a Douglas Adams' line from  So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish :    a bathroom which, she explained, you could actually swing a cat in. 'But,' she added, 'only if it was a reasonably patient cat and didn't mind a few nasty cracks about the head.'   The waiting is killing me.

       only connect     I started to write a post here about how looking forward I am to Texas, where I will hopefully begin to meet people who will fill me with that intense joy of getting to know lifelong friends. It was inspired by last night, a silly and fabulous evening of bowling, DDR, air hockey and late night Denny's with friend Mike from work. I was going to say some shit about how it was thrilling to finally hang out with someone I connect with and can hence "be myself" with, but I got about halfway through all these tortured lonely-girl  sentiments and thought, fuck.     The fact is, I already know this, you already know this, and there's not one single reason why I should waste your precious blog-reading time with it. There are people out there in the world that are fun to be with and there are others that you just either don't fit in with or don't like much. About equal numbers of both, I'd say, and anywhere you go you're bound to find a handful of wonderful joyous friends to keep you company. This is not in anyway to say that any of my current friends are replacable which of course they are not, and I still miss them deeply.     It used to be my thing to piss and moan about how there were only a very few people in the world that I felt comfortable enough in their company to let off the facade I normally wear (the kinds of people I can say shocking shit to, like "tuna just doesn't taste as good without the dolphins"), but lately I've been thinking that this is useless. I've decided to be unashamedly and unabashedly myself with everyone I interact with on a personal level from henceforth and see just where it gets me.  I'm a weird kid, I make weird noises, I think weird thoughts, and hell if I bottle that shit up anymore.     You know the one thing that I am  really  excited for about Texas? The fact that I'll actually start thinking of something interesting to blog about instead of this self-examination drivel. Man, I did all that crap in high school and college. Now's the time to start using everything I know to have a fucking good time at life, no apologies.

As my friend Toby once said, "Here's to being 23. Hope it doesn't suck."    Off to the beach for the remainder of the day.

       a funny story about armpit hair     I'll tell this to you guys, because you'll appreciate it. At least, Davis will appreciate it. I would like someone to do so, as I found it quite amusing and thus far not one of my coworkers has done anything but grimace slightly and give a tight smile at the punchline.     At Frogs the other day, during ESS (every day between 1 and 3 hundreds of elementary aged kids pour into the pool and wreak havoc upon the chemical levels in all sorts of ways...your imagination can fill in the gaps in my description), I was guarding on the pennisula, a small strip of concrete that separates the beach entrance/shallow end of the pool from the deeper, lap swimming end. Two girls who, a few weeks before, had introduced themselves to me, came swimming up to say hi (actually, the one girl I remembered had introduced herself to me by way of asking if I was a boy or a girl, which was a little disconcerting- goofy looking though I may be I am definitely a woman), took a look at my leg hair, and squealed a little.     Our exchange:  "Do you shave?" they asked.   "Does it look like I do?" I responded.  "Why not?"     I shrugged. A complicated explanation is in order- feminism, socialized gender, economical purposes, but heck, they're only 8. I stuck with "Because I don't like to" which is true enough. Now that I've stopped for this long, the thought of starting again makes me tired enough that I quickly put it out of my head.     "Do you shave your armpits?"  "No" and I showed them.   "Ewwwwww!" in stereo. I laughed.   "My mom shaves her armpits, so you should too!" says the impudent one.    At this point, "fuck your mother" and "to hell with your razor burn" are going through my head, but I continue to smile tersely and look pointedly at the pool trying to be the cool, in charge lifeguard that I am.     They start chanting, "Shave your armpits! Shave your armpits!"     Oh my darling children, though now you long for the day you too will be old enough to wield your razor high, or even when you are  just barely  old enough, when that thin layer of fuzz you've had from your toddler years will succumb to an electric shaver barely amped enough to shock a molerat, one day long past even that far off day you will realize that it ain't all it's cracked up to be.     And maybe you'll read all the right books or listen to the right kind of music and you'll just stop, as I have, and frolic in the giddiness that defying social norms and saving minutes in the shower brings to you.     It is also a fairly effective method of jerk protection.    I leave you with the wise words of  urlLink Alix Olson :    			They say, "cut your clits and shave your pits,    			and cover your tits!"   			We say- bullshit.    			Cause I use my curls to be at one with the world    			like when Im out camping   			And I lay myself to rest   			I sleep with my arms up    			so the birdies can nest.   			So stop and reconsider just what they consider natural   			Cause armpit hair is simply    			Mammally Factual.

       oh bother     Poor timing on the account of my body to let sickness creep up on it. I work so hard to keep myself from being sick (echinacea, vitamin c, folic acid, etc) that it makes me incredibly frustrated when I come down with something. This particular something is the kind of achy muscled, sharp ear pained,  foggy headed sinus disaster that warrants a day of bedrest and lots of fluids.     Unfortunately, although Sunday is usually my day off and reserved for the kind of well-placed laziness I've perfected, I agreed to sub for a coworker at Frogs from 12-6. I usually work at HCW on Saturdays, and I didn't yesterday, so it was a replacement day off and, needing money, I was happy to take this shift.  Now however, I want nothing more than to languish and moan in bed, occasionally getting up for a glass of water and looking properly pathetic whilst doing so.    I did get quite a lot of packing and room-organizing done yesterday, which makes me incredibly excited to actually move. A week and a half.  I don't work on my birthday, and I'd like to spend it at the beach. Hopefully someone will be able to join me, but I suppose I could just go alone if it comes to that. Going to the beach alone is better than staying at home alone.     That is possibly the saddest birthday thought ever.     Sigh. Well, lifeguarding today will be done high under the influence of Dayquil. All hail Dayquil!

       in honor of getting older   The countdown is narrowing rapidly:   -5 days til birthday -11 days til Ani -12 days til moving  I hooked up my HP computer from Madison and took off all the stuff I needed- suprisingly not very much as the email addresses are out of date and I don't need any of the term papers. What I did find was a link to something very valuble.   Presenting:  urlLink The Wes and Lauren Birthday Extravaganza 2001    [Edit: Bastards! Remote linking forbidden my pasty white ass!]   Unfortunately it is in directory form, and there are a lot of pictures to shuffle through. If you enable the thumbnails you can get a better idea of what you're looking at.   This is all the fun of my hot, sweaty, 20th birthday, graciously hosted (and mostly for) my wonderful birthday buddy Wes (whatever in the world is he up to these days, anyhow?).   The best pictures (i.e. the ones with me/Emily/B/Davis/Wes in them) start at  urlLink 1240 .  Can you tell I'm being nostalgic again? Sometimes it hurts a little to be packing up all this stuff AGAIN, and thinking about the memories AGAIN.   This time, mixed with the nostalgia is a glimmer of hope that Texas, where I'll be reunited with two old Madison friends, will produce happiness and fun times. AGAIN.

       boob tube   There's usually only one reason I turn on the TV, and that's Futurama. In recent weeks, I haven't even been watching that, so it is to my chagrin that tonight I sat down with my microwaved lasagna and watched three straight hours of VH1's  urlLink I Love The 90s .   The 80s version was fun, but a little over my head, at least until they got to about 87 or so. The 90s had the honor of welcoming me into my social consciousness, and it is with great pride that I can say I remember almost every hyper documented fad/movie/band/tv show represented on ILT90s. I grew up on this stuff, man. Ren and Stimpy, The X Files, Boyz II Men.   The inclusion of Ren and Stimpy in the lineup does mean that I can reference Futurama; the always-great  urlLink Billy West  makes an appearance and...well, is hilarious. Note to Jerry: you can catch your 30 second fix of Kyan Douglas in 1994 AND 95, bonus conversation about Prince Alberts included.   I have a major girly crush on Michael Ian Black. I can't fathom it: he's mildly annoying and predictably sarcastic. Still, kinda cute.   Anyway, the point of this post is not to wax nostalgic about the recently departed decade of my adolescence, but to wax philosophical about the phenomenon of "pop culture documentaries" like ILT90s and its ilk.  VH1 is especially guilty of flashy, highly caffeninated collages, glossy representations of our inclusive American consciousness. Nothing the commentators say is ever particularly enlightening or insightful but then again, I'm not saying they necessarily give you anything to think about. Waterworld was a conundrum, to be sure, but it didn't change my life in any degree.   It is impressive that I managed to stomach three hours of the show, as the method the producers use of giving you only three seconds or so of the footage in question, followed by a logo or dancing cell phone superimposed over the commentators' goofy reenactment, makes me vaguely homicidal. My brain goes slow, my eyes go slow, I need to see these things slowly to know what's going on. Sure, Michael Bolton is telling me these are the hotties of 93, but you can't hold the picture still long enough for me to even figure out what color her hair is (thank the goddess  he  got a haircut, by the way). I know this technique has been calibrated to the attention spans of the average VH1 audience, but it drives me nuts.   This is standard issue for the youth channels, which is why I find myself drawn more and more to less hectic episodes of  urlLink Sunday Night Sex Show . And more and more I turn the TV off for longer and longer. It's getting too easy to see all the tricks they use to keep you watching, keep you tuned in and brainless. Don't forget to buy a CD tomorrow, and wash your floors with Swiffer. Here's some more flashy colorful effects to keep you entertained inbetween commercials.   Removed as I am from my mentally stimulating college environment, where we never had cable and every night was an adventure, I must adapt to my new surroundings. My coworkers are, on average, between the ages of 16 and 21, smoke a lot of dope, study things like marketing and political science, and, while pleasant, do not have the broadest worldview. I am in the need of companionship, and in order to keep up with Joneses some sacrifices are in order. I don't get to rage on about the current state of political affairs nearly as much as is healthy for me, and must instead watch my tongue and discuss the Switchfoot album. Which I have not heard, and could care less about. No one knows who Ani Difranco is and when I mention attending the March for Women's Lives their eyes glaze over and they say, "oh, that's cool."   [Disclaimer: this does not apply to Heidi or most of the people at HCW. I'm a little bitter at Frogs and co. at the moment]  So, it's three hours of teenage nostalgia for with a bonus half hour of Johnny Depp trivia for good luck (that last not being so painful). Which is not to say I didn't enjoy the ride- more I am lamenting the factors that have led me to watch television in the first place. TV makes my brain hurt- which I assume must be the feeling it suffers just before it asphyxiates from lack of intelligent content.

       romantic comedy? oh.    urlLink When Harry Met Sally  is Emily's and my favorite movie from our roommate days. Harry Connick Jr, clever dialogue, and the small, yet exhilarating, hope that someday  our  best guy friends will be...the one.   It was on AMC tonight and I watched it.   Besides making me incredibly anxious to see Jerry, in New York, during the winter with the pretty snow and the holiday cheer, it also made me rather heartsick.   Here's a question I ask myself: armed heavily as I am with feminist rhetoric and theory, am I allowed to moon over such touching saccharine romance?   The answer is, of course a feminist can have romance.   But oh, to have someone sprint city blocks for me in New York, on New Years Eve, to tell me he/she loves me, has always loved me, especially when I do that thing with my eyebrows.   Then there was a new emotion, utterly confusing and gut-wrenching for the very strangeness of it to my collective emotional psyche.   I actually wanted to get married.   My vendetta against marriage is not really against marriage- I would consider the actual union as a possibility- but rather I have (or had) no desire for the actual ceremony, the pomp, the circumstance, the delightfully 80s puffy sleeved bridesmaid dresses in tones of mauve and forest green.   Tonight there was a little twinge in the back of my mind that tried valiantly to build me up into a fervor (my sensibility being much more authoritative, it was silenced and rebuked heartily). Something about getting to dress up and be the most beautiful woman of the day (unless of course I marry a woman, in which case, it's a photo finish), to glow and have flowers and fuss over which uncle has gotten drunk enough to serenade me with Men At Work songs.   Just so you know, I've checked my temperature and I'm not running a fever. It's likely the late hour and the aftereffects of the  combination of controlled substances I used yesterday are working together to create an irrational and completely silly Meg Ryan sympathizer. This feeling will likely pass after I sleep on it, which I will point out, embarrassed, tomorrow.   For now, I have promised myself a luxury: I will indulge the fantasy this evening as I settle into bed, knowing that my imagination will not be satisfied with touching romantic comedy and will in the end introduce a rampaging rhinoceros, or perhaps a scorned transsexual lover, that will tear down the whole facade and leave me helpless and depressed. My imagination likes me that way, because misery creates the greatest art.   It's an odd thing, this romance. Sneaks up on you while you're brewing green tea and taps you on the shoulder quite in the same way your young cousin might when she's put gummy bears in your underwear. Suddenly I'm looking around at the people I know and thinking, "if the lighting were just dim enough and I was idly swirling a glass of red wine, well..." Disconcerting and foolish, all at once.   Upon reflection, gummy bears in my underwear sounds quite enticing, and I think I will dream about that instead.

       cleaning up   Changed the template (this one matches charmingly with my Tara profile picture), gussied up the comment and trackback links, reorganized the blogroll and got rid of a few things that are extraneous. Should you miss desperately any of the links I have removed, contact me and I will send you the url.   It's near freezing in our house because of the air conditioner. I seriously dislike climate control- although in the middle of humid Madison July it has it's moments- because right now it is not necessary and my toes are frozen. I think I will sit outside and read, waiting for Heidi to call me back about the beach tonight.

       explanation of the previous evening's adventures   In succinct and unslurred tones, I will commence to tell you the story of my Saturday afternoon, which as Saturday afternoons go, was quite the party.   High Country West (the small, community club I work at) has an annual picnic in July, with a DJ, pool games, various forms of meat between slices of bread, ice cream, pony rides, and beer.   That last is vitally important to the storyline.   I arrived at 2 to do my part, starting out by guarding for the pool games, and at 3 serving ice cream (the worst job there, and the stickiest). At 4 Aaron and I cleaned up the ice cream table and joined the rest of the staff in picking up trash, rearranging patio furniture, and just generally getting the place back in order.  urlLink Aaron West  and his brother Cameron were playing a live set, which made it quite a pleasant sunny July afternoon (today, I have Pink Floyd's "Wish You Were Here" stuck in my head). As I wandered back to the area with the drinks and grills, I found Dana (boss), Sean, McKenna, Heidi, and Jared standing amicably around the keg. I was given a cup. I thought, "this job rules" and tucked in.   I wandered back and forth between the keg and the music, pretending like I was actually doing work, but mostly just feeling a general warmness of being that often comes with summer days and community happenings. At the drinks patio, the guards mentioned above were rapidly becoming drunk as proverbial skunks, teasing the tweenagers and behaving rather erratically. I had to work til 10, so I imbibed responsibly up until a point. The point were I thought, "fuck it," this opportunity comes so rarely, and you're only young once, Cameron's just played "Vienna" for me and all is right with the world. My headguard, McKenna, is the one encouraging me to drink, so what can you do? The boss says jump, you say "how high," the boss says drink, you say "how much?"   We had quite a good time 'round that keg. It was my turn to lifeguard, so I went, did my half hour (the Red Cross specifically warns against the imbibement of alcoholic beverages whilst lifeguarding, as it impares the mind's ability to think quickly and make decisions. Also, it makes it hard to care), and wandered back again to find them still firmly planted about the keg.   The rest of my shift went uneventfully- McKenna and I walked down to the elementary school to smoke (I watched) and chatted. She's quite a cool kid, and closer to my age and mental state than some of the other employees. Also, she's much in need of friends in San Diego, so there will be many more good times with her before I leave.   I left early- cleaned the bathroom counters and toilets as penance for my misdeeds, and ended up at a party in the same neighborhood (behind Megan's house, coincidentally enough) with McKenna and Aaron. There was much pot smoking. It was the kind of evening that lately I've been having a lot of- this desire to put something bad in my lungs and swirl it around a bit. It's not the kind of desire that makes me want to take up smoking (lords no) but just one that wanders around after I've been drinking and encourages me to "lighten up" and "live a little." Just so. The party was rather dull but it did the trick and I left, after sobering up, much satisfied with the events of my evening.   The post below is not a reference to any sort of hook up (sadly so), but just to my laziness and general sense of partied-outness. Today I find that my room is a wreck: there are clothes scattered on every available surface (not all of this is from last night, it has been steadily building the past week or so) and papers and boxes are taking up my limited floor space. Today I have nothing to do, as planned, and intend to pack up my clothes. Books are done, many things are already in boxes. Could get started on my CDs, as well.   With that anticlimactic end to my nocturnal adventures, I leave you, dear reader, to shake your head in wonderment and go about your day as if nothing has changed. No, nothing whatsoever.

       why high country west is officially my favorite workplace   because I got ridiculously drunk, at work, with my coworkers, at our annual neighborhood picnic. i skipped out on the end of my shift early because i'm pretty much useless as a lifeguard, and plus, there's more drinking ahead with said coworkers. just thought i'd let you know, that this pool is awesome, and i hereby take back anything i've said about any of them being prudish and goody two shoes.   mwah. stop moving, computer screen.

       competitive edge   Was watching the trials for  urlLink Olympic swimming  on NBC tonight. Michael Phelps and Natalie Coughlin, damn.   Thing is, watching it just makes me itchy to race again. The thrill of competition sings in my nerves and I want to be up on a block, sizing up my fellow swimmers. I want to be neck and neck with the girl in the lane next to me, each of us bound and determined to win. I want to hear the cheer of crowd after I touch the wall and swing my head up to see my time.   I was never really fast enough to be even close to Olympic good, but I often wonder what kind of races I'd be swimming if I'd kept at it competitively. Or would injury stifle my strokes?   I've been swimming for fitness at Frogs during my down time, but tomorrow I think- I think I'll race the clock. Pretend like that girl I never liked from swim team is next to me and I'm kicking her ass big time. Hee.

       just to be totally random   There are still pictures of my  urlLink  Royal Regiment days  floating around on the internet.   here you see me looking extremely peeved about not having sunglasses, whilst Kyle Mitchell leans over to tell me that I missed a note:      And now I'm in London, looking sassy, yet virginal. Hey, it's Jonny standing next to me, before I got annoyed with him and his brother (second from left) and told them to fuck off in Switzerland:     One more, for posterity. I'm a good marcher, and look, I'm always prepared with my field charts in a binder on a string. (ahem...DORK ALERT!) Ooh, Brian Harris!:     There you have it. I was cool, in the bando universe. Carry on about your normal business.

       flattering, but not completely right   From  urlLink 20 questions to a better personality :   Wackiness: 62/100 Rationality: 74/100 Constructiveness: 68/100 Leadership: 32/100      You are a WRCF--Wacky Rational Constructive Follower. This makes you Paul Begala. You are unflappable and largely unconcerned with others' reactions to you. You were not particularly interested in the results of this test, and probably took it only as a result of someone else asking you to.      You have a biting wit and intense powers of observation. No detail is lost on you, and your friends know it--relying on you to have the facts when others express only opinions. You are even-tempered, friendly, and educated. Foolish strangers may mistake your mildness for weakness--they will be surprised.      You entire approach to life is enviable. You will raise good kids.   I had to look up  urlLink Paul Begala .   I'm not really all that observant, but I agree with the rest of it. I'm totally enviable.   Actually, "foolish strangers may mistake your mildness for weakness," rings true this summer, as I encounter new folks who take my quiet nature for naivete. Some have even gone so far as to boss me around- and they've realized they don't get very far with me that way.   I wouldn't say that the "follower" bit is far off, but it's more like "loner"- I'd rather not lead, I don't mind following, but what I really want to do is go off on my own and create my own universe. You can come too, if you want, but don't expect to have too much say in the position of the planets.

       oh, all the things i could have been doing   On your current playlist, hit shuffle and pick the first twenty songs on the list (no matter how cheesy or embarrassing), and write down your favorite line of the song. Try to avoid puting the song title in the line.  Then have your friends comment and see if they know the songs!  (stolen from  urlLink Jane )  1. "My heart went cold and only hollow rhythms resounded from within" 2. "He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand" 3.

       about loneliness    urlLink Jerry,   I feel you. That's how I've felt most of this year, well, mostly. It wasn't so much the physical loneliness as the psychic that got to me. Not having someone to talk to unconditionally. Missing you. Not knowing what's next or why or how it will come.   Maybe I'm still looking for that fling, maybe work has made me some friends that manage to keep me busy, maybe I've perfected the art of thinking about other things, but you're always on my mind, hon. I have to put parts of me in hibernation to go so long without seeing you, or I'll rot away from sadness. Maybe we won't ever have what we used to, because life is just working out like that. I want you to know that I'm going to have a hard time finding anyone to mean even half of what you mean to me.   And yeah, I wish things were different. Things I could have changed, things I have no power over.   I'm ready for a new adventure, and I know you are too. You look around and see tenderness, and wonder when it's coming back for you. It's hard not to get frustrated, but if you don't keep trying- well, it's not going to fall into your lap. The joy of getting to know someone new, of working things out, of giddiness and nausea, that's what you're missing. Me too. Little crushes and shy smiles. The awkward dance, the contrived meetings and things you go out of your way to do. Feeling like a fool but having it all come out alright at the end. Stories to tell.   Good luck, but don't be a stranger. I love you.

       more blogging than you can shake a pixie stick at!   I know, I know, I am a liar. I said I wouldn't blog much, but when I'm in a good mood, I blog. When I blog, I'm in a good mood. It's a vicious cycle. Actually, the thing is when I am in such a mood I think of funny things to say and then I feel worthwhile again.   So I just wanted you to know that I watch the  urlLink Time Zones  page on my Sitemeter and enjoy the competition over highest percentage of my readership between the Central Standard Time (props to the Wisconsinites!) and the Eastern Standard Time folks (with the addition of Jerry, you are fighting a close race!). It sways back and forth each day and is quite exciting. Go EST! You can do it! Don't let them catch up, CST! 2, 4, 6, 8, who do we appreciate? Illinois! Rock on Michigan, tell it like it is, Florida!   What's up, California? I friggin' live here, you think you'd represent your homie. Fine, fine, be that way.   Here's a toast to my Australian readership. And those loyal European fans (I know it's you, Bethany!).   Who's  urlLink googling me ? (or yahooing, rather, but that sounds naughty and I want in on it) You are a PSTer, you can't hide from me. Have I googled you? (Probably, I like to googlestalk people) Are you having a good time here? Would you like something to drink? Some chips and salsa? Make yourself at home.  This is what you get when you combine chai lattes and lack of sleep. Another random train of thought: Check out my old buddy  urlLink Aaron , whom I saw perform tonight and enjoyed thoroughly.

       more on coincidences   Wednesday night I went to the  urlLink Martini Ranch  with Natalie and her friend Deirdre (sp?), to hear  urlLink David Patrone  (and his awesome quartet) do a little crooning. Guys and Dolls was on the big screen. I mentioned to Natalie that I thought young Marlon Brando was  urlLink quite the hunk , and we wondered what the hell happened as he aged.   Today I go over to  urlLink Pamie  and find that  urlLink Marlon Brando has died at age 80 .   Dan's convinced that he killed Brando, but I think I have a part in it. We weren't nice to old Brando. Whoops. Hope I didn't sabotage the Beastie Boys, too, while I was at it.   Oh yeah, and...AYN RAND!

       friday! july! i love july!   I'm in a better mood, Sunday's the fourth of July, my birthday is in 19 days, I leave for Texas in 25, hurray!  I'd been a bad mood all week mostly because of work, because I was working non stop, I hadn't worn dry clothes for seven days, and people at work were being petty and dramatic. Today I thought, "fuck this" and shrugged it all off. My buddy Mike came back from vacation and I was so happy to see him I gave him a big wet-out-of-the-pool hug and I realized, I haven't been genuinely, truly hugged in forever. Everyone needs hugs. He was happy to see me, too, and I could cry from the joy of having someone be happy to see me. You never miss it til it's gone.   I don't know if I'll be blogging that much in the next few weeks; my work schedule is still fairly insane and I've got lots of packing and planning to do. As Davis mentioned in my comments, however, it is possible that the different environment of Texas will encourage my snark and feminist wit. Look forward to that.   I'll leave you with something I delight in: the thrill of coincidences. For example:   As my kids and I played noodle races today I mentioned that anything goes, you can sabotage your opponents by stealing their noodle, dunking them, or squirting water through the hole. One of my boys loved the word "sabotage" so much he kept repeating it for the rest of the lesson. Official word of the weekend.   When I went out to my car to go home, what song should be on the radio but the Beastie Boys, "Sabotage."   I love it when life does that.

       phew   Chris and I were getting kind of worried that it would be a while before we began actually working, with money involved, and I know at least I was a little hesitant to say anything good about the place until I knew I wouldn't just be flat broke for a month. Well, yesterday we started as marching band techs for a high school band camp, 90 degree heat, humidity and all.  Turns out the new marching guy/assistant band director at the school is a friend of Chris's from Madison Scouts, and he's also mm mm good looking. Heh. We've helped out with marching rehearsals and today I ran a sectional. I can never tell if teenage boys genuinely think I'm amusing, or if they're just making fun of me. Any thoughts from my teenage readership?  So, with some money on its way to my pocket and an activity to keep me busy (even if I curse the bloody Texas mosquitos, the biggest I've ever seen), I can say that this is going to be a good place to be, at least for a year or two. I think I'll learn a lot, and make some valuable friends in the music business. My doubts and fears are relieved for the time being.  Thanks for the comments, bitches. :)

       don't mess with texas   Here I am in the wonderful city of Plano, TX, having traversed the country in three days driving, all my shit in the trunk, to start over and figure stuff out.  Hey, my apartment's nice.  We don't have much furniture but it's pretty cool. Garage sales are the greatest, and Plano's got some doozies (there are ridiculously nice neighborhoods here). I have a bed, which is all I really need, and some groceries, so I can stay alive by eating and sleeping at the very least.  Waiting to hear back about the jobs. It might be a week or two before I really get started, as right now is busy marching band camp season and school doesn't start for another couple of days. No matter, I'll get to know the place and find my way around. Keep me away from Target though, because I'm spending all my savings.  Chris and I are going to have a blast. Already we've got 8 gazillion new private jokes and have reminisced about practically every Madison memory we can think of. More of this will be done when Jason gets into the state, and we all get trashed and loll around on the floor of my giant apartment.  Speaking of alcohol, Plano is in a dry county, so you can't buy hard liquor around here. You have to drive over to the next town, Richardson, which is in Dallas county, to get that stuff. You can buy beer and wine, but not liquor. Hm.  Chris and I took DART into Dallas today and walked around the West End, a fashionable historic district. It was pretty cool. The Sixth Floor Museum is there, which is in the building that the assassination of JFK took place. It was rather touching, but I think I'll save a trip up to the actual museum until my parents visit, or something.  Anyway, I'm at the library. We get internet in two weeks, so until then I will post whenever I get a chance with updates and tidbits. Thanks to Jerry for guestblogging, you're the greatest babe. The greatest, I say! :)
