      I wish I was back in high school for this one:   urlLink Wireless Networking for the TI graphing calculators .  Back in high school, our graphing calculators full of games saved some of our sanity.  We went so far as to create Tetris tournaments.  I went so far as to create games in BASIC for the TI-85, then to learn assembly for the TI-92.  I never did get enough knowledge of the TI-92 to create games, but that knowledge did help me out with my college course in assembly.

      I can smell her now. The scent is reminiscent of a powder. Not baby powder, but a dry, mute aroma. A floral accent is present, similar to lilacs yet not as pungent. Before this, I only had one visual. The setting is always the same. Nighttime turns red to grey and yellow to white. She stands softly with her back to a wall of windows, covered mostly with draperies. It seems to be our bedroom. The visual of her is the strongest. Long, straight hair frames her oval face, giving her an intelligent air. The color black is an understatement, for her raven hair is so dark it is translucent. The contrast to her pale skin is remarkable. Though barely visible in the moonlight, her eyes burn with a comfortable evil. She is definitely my equal. Her attire is still a bit hazy. The Japanese aspects of my psyche scream out kimono, yet it could just be a simple shapeless dress she is wearing. The setting speaks that we are home for the night, or we could have just gotten home. There are many things I know, yet questions still remain. Her emotion toward me has two possibilities; she is either upset and concerned about something between us, or she has a joy in her heart boundless. The year I turn 22 is pivotal, but is it because we meet this year, or because we get married in that year?  These images and soothsay swirl in my mind as a mist, never to be grasped.

      To counteract my actions of snobbery, my monitor decided that it really really liked Yellow.  Trying to view the net in shades of yellow will kill your eyesight for at least an hour for every 5 minutes of surfing.  It was a nice flat screen 17 inch NEC, but I got it used without a warranty.  $350 will disappear from my wallet soon.  I am currently using a 14'' POS, and 14 inches is not enough to satisfy.

      The following concerns a question in a physics degree exam at the University of Copenhagen:

"Describe how to determine the height of a skyscraper with a barometer."

One student replied:

"You tie a long piece of string to the neck of the barometer, then lower the barometer from the roof of the skyscraper to the ground. The length of the string plus the length of the barometer will equal the height of the building."

This highly original answer so incensed the examiner that the student was failed immediately. The student appealed on the grounds that his answer was indisputably correct, and the university appointed an independent arbiter to decide the case.

The arbiter judged that the answer was indeed correct, but did not display any noticeable knowledge of physics. To resolve the problem it was decided to call the student in and allow him six minutes in which to provide a verbal answer which showed at least a minimal familiarity with the basic principles of physics.

For five minutes the student sat in silence, forehead creased in thought. The arbiter reminded him that time was running out, to which the student replied that he had several extremely relevant answers, but couldn't make up his mind which to use. On being advised to hurry up the student replied as follows:

"Firstly, you could take the barometer up to the roof of the skyscraper, drop it over the edge, and measure the time it takes to reach the ground. The height of the building can then be worked out from the formula H = 0.5g x t squared. But bad luck on the barometer."

"Or if the sun is shining you could measure the height of the barometer, then set it on end and measure the length of its shadow. Then you measure the length of the skyscraper's shadow, and thereafter it is a simple matter of proportional arithmetic to work out the height of the skyscraper."

"But if you wanted to be highly scientific about it, you could tie a short piece of string to the barometer and swing it like a pendulum, first at ground level and then on the roof of the skyscraper. The height is worked out by the difference in the gravitational restoring force T = 2 pi sqrroot (l / g)."

"Or if the skyscraper has an outside emergency staircase, it would be easier to walk up it and mark off the height of the skyscraper in barometer lengths, then add them up."

"If you merely wanted to be boring and orthodox about it, of course, you could use the barometer to measure the air pressure on the roof of the skyscraper and on the ground, and convert the difference in millibars into feet to give the height of the building."

"But since we are constantly being exhorted to exercise independence of mind and apply scientific methods, undoubtedly the best way would be to knock on the janitor's door and say to him 'If you would like a nice new barometer, I will give you this one if you tell me the height of this skyscraper'."

The student was Niels Bohr, the only Dane to win the Nobel prize for Physics.

one more turn toward the east,
I realize your green-screen mentality
and I know it is shared by many more,
I know it's quite impossible 
but I am damned to find a way to revolve the other way,
every time I scrutinize I just say "screw it",
we're on a ride down a blind  conduit

2. To think again and again; to muse; to meditate; to ponder; to reflect.

The new  urlLink i815E  chipset from  urlLink Chipzilla  is a definite improvement over the i810 and i820 chipsets, or so says a  urlLink review from Sharky Extreme .  The 820 is obviously plagued by the high cost of RDRAM.  After significant price cuts, 128meg of RDRAM still costs  $350 !  The 810 was plagued by the onboard video, which was not upgradeable.  The 815 uses SDRAM yet also has an AGP slot for video upgradability.  The 815 also has a great affinity for onboard hardware, such as a network adapter, modem, or sound card.

Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of modern times, died of a brain edema in Hong Kong at the age of 32.  While the cause of the edema was never determined, doctors believed it was due to hypersensitivity to a medication.   He died prior to the release of his last film "Enter the Dragon."

Even though current research has not come up with hard proof, all of these anti-bacterial soaps/cleansers/sheets/door knobs  are going to eventually create resistant bacteria.  It is a proven fact that all of the genetic testing on bacteria has created a few monsters, but they were controlled.  Having triclosan and the other antibacteria products being used by the ton each day everywhere is not a closed environment.

       urlLink The Girls Room  tour was g.d. awesome!  The night started off excellently with the local act.  A powerful voice, skillful piano work, and undeniably emotional lyrics marked the performance by  urlLink Keri Noble .  No one was expecting anything from the local act, especially since we had seen her walking around nervously before the performance.  She played  Perfect , and two other songs of which I have forgotten the titles.   urlLink Tara MacLean  was the reason why she played three songs.  After two, Keri began to walk off stage while the crowd was in an uproar. Tara ran over and practically shoved her back on stage.  My group gave her a standing O when she was done.  Following this display of musical excellence was a mockery: Amy Correia.  Described as having a 'unique voice' and 'eclectic songs', that is just one way of saying that she sucks.  Expect www.AmyCorreiaSucks.com before too long.   Starfishin'  was one of the most annoying songs I have ever heard.   Angels Collide  had good lyrics, but that is the only good thing I will ever have to say about that girl.  Knowing that Tara was coming on next, my group sat on the floor directly in front of the stage.  Two of the people I was with had seen Tara 4 times before, and I have heard great things about her shows.  She was just as vivacious, cute, and talented as they had all said.  We all got to sing along with   urlLink If You Could   because the crowd did it for her last time she was in the Detroit area and she loved it.  After Tara was Shannon McNally: more crap.   Fast Forward to the signing session.  I was too shy to talk to either Keri or Tara.

      Why do the Chinese use chopsticks?  They developed this custom because they didn't need anything resembling a knife and fork at the table. They cut up food into bite-sized pieces in the kitchen before serving it.  This stemmed from their belief that bringing meat to the table in any form resembling an animal was uncivilized and that it was inhospitable, anyway, to ask a guest to cut food while eating.

      Religion fired up in my life when I was baptized  some  form of Christian.  This much I know, not because the holy water scalded and scarred my body, but because the parents say so.  The next religious event would be going to a Baptist church with my father around the age of 11.  Deciding that religion was a good thing, he took me an hour before the main service to attend their form of sunday school.  The other kids were practically wearing suits and their best dresses, while I sat timidly in a tucked in tshirt.  Not having any of the materials the other children did and not being able to answer any of the questions asked, I soon disappeared from their mind.  Seems that my father assumed that I would be able to find the main service after sunday school.   Wrong.  Being timid enough from the uber-Christian children, I did not even venture out of the basement.  All of the children my age left, and many parents brought down children too young for the main service.   For the next hour, I stayed with 6 year olds coloring Bible scenes while eating graham crackers with milk.  Needless to say, I never wanted to return to church again.  Dragged by my aunt and grandmother, I attended a few Catholic services over the years.  The idea of  "stand, sit, kneel, sit, pray, give money out of the infinite Catholic guilt"  process did not appeal to me.     By the age of 13, I realized there were other religions out there.  Not to say I was fully against Christianity, but my early experiences turned me from that faith in a hurry.  "God created Man in his own image" is reverse logic.   Man  created  God , especially in his own image.  Heaven and Hell are products of the human psyche being unable to comprehend unconciousness.  If the mind does not exist after death, how can we understand it?   Since that is impossible (sarcasm), Heaven and Hell were created as a true after life .  The afterlife is just like the mortal existence, yet a dichotomy is created.  If you were good, Heaven; Bad, Hell.  Is this not a very ingenious way to keep control over people during their entire life?  Then again, Karma is almost the same pattern.  Defining your next form through reincarntion based on Karma; it's the same sort of control.  Mankind has created religion as a way to answer that which cannot be answered.  Along the way, it has been tailored such that it can control the masses.    Studies on Buddhism and Hinduism were most appealing to me at a younger age.  Except for the aforementioned problems inherent with the karma and caste systems, the religions seem more logical.  There is Conservation of Matter and Conservation of Energy, so the idea of Conservation of Soul (life force, spirit) makes perfect sense to my logical mind.  Reincarnation, of some form, is the only conclusion to life that makes any sense.  Not even my mind can grasp the idea that we just  die .  Maybe I would enjoy life more knowing that.

      I burned 9 CDs the other day, all for one friend.  It took about 6 hours, since I kept getting random errors during the testing phase. Eventually I figured out the problems, and wrote titles on all 9 CDs.  Turns out that the pen I used was so sharp that it tore the coating off the front of the CD.  The lasers used to read the CD shine right through, and they were all ruined.  Note to others:  only use paint pens to write on CD-Rs.

      The problems setting up the  urlLink OpenBSD  server continue.  In an attempt to make use of old hardware, I tried to use a Pentium 60 machine.  It was the very first real computer I ever used.  The Bios came out when the idea of "Plug and Play" did not exist. All of the network cards I have are PnP.  There is a way to configure them manually, but that would require installing them into my current machine (which can definitely handle PnP), booting from a DOS disk, then running a few utilities.  Instead, I will probably just use my old K6 233 machine.  In contrast, once I get the hardware setup, I will have almost no trouble  urlLink configuring OpenBSD 2.7 as a cable NAT system .

      I worked  17.5  hours yesterday.  Took a half an hour break for dinner between jobs, and that was about it for rest.  In  urlLink Ann Arbor , most of the client machines could not connect to anything but the file server.  Knowing that the file server uses Appletalk as the protocol and TCP/IP is used for everything else, we narrowed down the list of possible problems.  Checking out the error logs on our servers showed stuff like this over and over and over:
 Aug 16 18:54:45 beer.pub.umich.edu dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from 00:50:e4:30:6f:24 via eth1 
Aug 16 18:54:45 beer.pub.umich.edu dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 141.211.148.76 to 00:50:e4:30:6f:24 via eth1

Aug 16 18:54:45 beer.pub.umich.edu dhcpd: DHCPNAK on 10.0.1.5 to 00:50:e4:30:6f:24 via eth1 
In basic terms, this is what was happening:  a system comes online and tries to DISCOVER the DHCP server, the server OFFERs a good IP from it's pool, the client REQUESTed a bad IP, and the server does Not AcKnowledge that request.  Then the cycle repeats.  This made no sense to all three of us working on the problem.   We tried restarting our DHCP server, we tried using a different server, etc etc.  FINALLY, Sat realized that someone had an  urlLink Apple AirPort  they wanted to hook up.   Searching the  urlLink Apple Tech Info Library , we found out that the AirPort acts as a DHCP server!  It was accepting all of the requests, and just giving out bad information!  Took that off the network, and everything returned to normal.  And it only took 8 hours to figure that out.

      I used to joke about how my main non-free ISP was AOL (simply because a family member has paid for it, and I get an account), yet my main operating system has become some flavor of UNIX.  I thought I would never see this day, but there is now an  urlLink AOL client for Linux .  I cannot try it out, simply because I only have a winmodem that doesn't work in Linux, but we shall see when I get that cable modem...

      Every morning I read all of the articles at  urlLink My AltaVista , simply because it is the automatic homepage when I use  urlLink AltaVista Free Access .  When I read that  urlLink Famke Janssen was learning to lap dance  for a new film, I didn't pay much attention.  Later in the day when I realized that  urlLink Janssen  played Dr. Jean Grey in the X Men movie, my thoughts fully changed.  She is one of under 5 women in the public eye (read: celebrities) that I find attractive.  The others include Natalie Portman and Christy Turlington.

      The best part of  urlLink this article about cloning the Tazmanian tiger :
 A far more emotional debate rages over the plan to reincarnate the tiger through cloning. Archer has crossed angry picket lines at his museum, and his work has been denounced by religious groups who accuse the scientists of playing God.  “My response is that people played God when we exterminated the animal in the first place,” Archer said.

      Don't laugh.  It feels weird that I no longer have an  urlLink AOL  account.  Even though I have had much better ways to connect over the past two years (think LAN connected to a T1), the lack of the ability to hop on AOL is overwhelming.  No longer can I check the profiles of friends, no longer can I...    wait, I guess all I ever used AOL for was to check profiles.  I just need to 'borrow' an account from someone every once in awhile, and all will be good.

      I remember discussing the futility of regrowing neurons in my Neurobiology class first semester of my sophomore year.  It was decided that even if new cells could be transplanted and they would grow, the neural net would be so complex that the cells would never fully integrate themselves.  The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania has made an attempt at this experiment.  The  urlLink results  show that the neurons helped stroke victims regain motor control.  A very promising step indeed.

       urlLink Date Negotiations 
Cast: 
Bruce- Gerald 
Mark- Gerald
[Bruce is behind his desk, rubbing a credit or business card down his cheek.] 
Mark: [enters the office] Gerald. 

Bruce: Gerald! How are you, ya old skunk? 

Mark: Ah, how are you, ya old snake? 

[They begin shaking hands.] 

Bruce: Pretty good. [laughs] Good to see ya. Hey, how was your weekend? 

Mark: Aw, not too bad. A little too short, though; how was yours? 

Bruce: [laughs] Good, but a little short. 

[Both laugh.] 

Bruce: Business. 

Mark: Yeah. 

[They finally stop shaking and sit down--Bruce behind his desk and Mark in the chair in front of it.] 

Both: So. 

[Pause.] 

Mark: Well, I would now be willing to take a look at the proposal your client is making to my Lori. 

Bruce: On behalf of Dennis I'm, um, happy to show it to you. 

[He hands Mark one large index card, which Mark looks at.] 

Bruce: It's perfectly straightforward. 

Mark: A little too damn straightforward, Gerald; don't you think? 

Bruce: Uh...what do you mean? 

Mark: I'm sorry. I can in no way say that this represents the interests of my client. 

Bruce: It's a standard itinerary, Gerald--dinner, dancing, and [mumbles into his hand] intercourse. 

Mark: [abruptly] I beg your pardon? 

Bruce: [confident] Dinner, dancing, and intercourse. 

Mark: You mean a quick *hump*, don't you Gerald?! 

Bruce: I do not mean a quick hump, Gerald! Do not use that expression in this office! Children come in here! 

Mark: "Dinner, dancing, and intercourse"--what do you think my client is, huh? A 90-dollar-an-evening hooker? 

Bruce: This is dinner at the *Plaza*, Gerald. 

Mark: Oh really?! So, she's a 120-dollar-an-evening hooker, is that it? 

Bruce: Well, at least a hooker comes across. [pause] I can't believe I said that. 

Mark: Gerald, do I sense that, uh, your client has certain feelings for my client? 

Bruce: My client makes 62,000 dollars a year. 

Mark: Ah. But, does your client have certain emotional interests towards my client. 

Bruce: He's got a really great car and a moustache. 

Mark: Gerald, does your client love my client? 

Bruce: Yes! No! He's not sure. [pause] Back off Gerald! 

Mark: I'll back off, but perhaps now you'd be willing to take a look at the proposal my client is making to your client. 

Bruce: [big sigh] 

[Mark opens up his briefcase and drops a folder containing a thick stack of papers onto the desk. Bruce opens the folder and flips through a few pages without really looking anything.] 

Bruce: You forgot one thing, Gerald. 

Mark: What's that? 

Bruce: The actual date of the wedding and the color of the bridesmaids' gowns!

Mark: Come off it Gerald. It's a standard 17-week dating commitment. All my client wants to do is to get to know your client. 

Bruce: Hey, all my client wants to do is get to know your client. 

Mark: In a completely different way! 

Bruce: I don't know, I think she's gotten to know quite a few clients. [Opens up desk drawer, ready to take out folders.] Let's just look at her roster of ex-boyfriends. 

Mark: Gerald, that's inadmissible and you know it! 

Bruce: [realizes his error and gently closes the drawer.] The Doobie Brothers?? 

[pause] 

Mark: All right, perhaps we were a little hasty with the 17-week dating commitment. Perhaps we can accommodate the obvious interests of your client a bit more. How about this: a six date schedule with possible sexual intercourse on date six. 

Bruce: Gerald, I'm no longer interested in this "possible sexual intercourse" you keep selling me on. Last time, it turned out to be a cheap handjob at the drive in. 

Mark: Your client ejaculated, Gerald! 

Bruce: Sadly. Very sadly. Let's just let sleeping dogs lie, shall we? [pause] Three date schedule, guaranteed sexual intercourse on dates two and three. 

Mark: Uh uh. Five date schedule, guaranteed sexual intercourse on date five. Now that's a one-way ticket to Loveland, Gerald. That's a heap of good lovin'. That's a Love-o-rama. That's a Love Fest. That's a Love Woodstock, for God's sake. Come back to me. 

[Long pause. Bruce has a goofy smile on his face, in thought.] 

Bruce: Gerald. [calling him in closer] Gerry. [closer] Ger. . .Guh. Why don't we forget the guaranteed sexual intercourse clause. 

Mark: Okay. 

Bruce: Why don't we let nature take it's course. 

Mark: Fine! 

Bruce: You know the good old fashioned way? 

Mark: [eagerly] Yeah, okay. 

Bruce: A one date schedule with a guarantee that your client will consume 27-ounces of gin on that evening. 

Mark: Come off it Gerald! That's panty peeler and you know it. 

Bruce: Call it what you will, it's a tool of the trade. 

Mark: Sorry Gerald. C'mon, she only weighs 105 pounds, for God's sake. 

Bruce: I believe she weighs 111 pounds, Gerald. 

Mark: In shoes! [pause] All right. I can't see letting her drink more than 8-ounces of gin. 

Bruce: Jeez, I think she can drink, uh, 14-ounces of gin. 

Mark: Maybe 10, maybe 10. 

Bruce: I think she could scarf down 12-ounces of gin. 

Mark: 11-ounces of gin. 

Bruce: 12-ounces of gin on an empty stomach. 

Mark: 11 on an empty stomach. 

Bruce: [taps his fingers on the desk, calculating in his head.] 111. . .Done! 

Mark: Okay. 

[Both getting up] 

Mark: I'll have my secretary pick up the contracts Monday. 

[They lean over and kiss each other on the cheek. Mark turns to leave and then they do a subtle double take.]

[Bruce is singing his son to sleep.]

Bruce: [singing] Picnic time for teddy bears / Those little teddy bears are having a wonderful time tonight.

[Bruce tries to leave because Scott appears to be asleep. As soon as Bruce tries this, Scott wakes up and looks to Bruce as if he's not at all tired.]

Bruce: [singing] See them gaily play about / They love to sing and shout.

[Bruce tries to leave again, same thing happens.]

Bruce: [singing] They haven't got any cares [Gets up to leave but this time continues to sing] But it's six o' clock / Their mummies and daddies will take them home to bed / Because they're tired little teddy bears. [talking] Good night. [Flips light off.] 

Scott: Dad?

Bruce: [light back on, still at doorway] Uh, yes?

Scott: Were all the bears there?

Bruce: Yes. All the bears there ever there was were there. Goodnight.

Scott: Dad? How--how come the picnic ended at six o' clock? If it was so good? I mean, it's--it's not even dark at six.

Bruce: Uh, all the bears were tired from, um..., frolicking.

Scott: Oh.

Bruce: Frolicking's very tiring, son. Goodnight

Scott: Okay, what they--what they eat?

Bruce: Oh. Well. The teddy bears ate buttons and...felt.

Scott: Ewww!

Bruce: Oh, no no! That's teddy bear food.

Scott: Oh.

Bruce: It's like hot dogs. Mmm. 

Scott: Okay, yeah. Were you even there? What?

Bruce: [Bruce sees he is not about to leave, so he goes back to Scott at the bed.] No, I wasn't actually there.

Scott: Well, then--then how do you know?

Bruce: A guy at work told me.

Scott: Who?

Bruce: Hank.

Scott: Hank who?

Bruce: You don't know him.

Scott: Maybe I should call this Hank.

Bruce: No no. I don't think that would be a good idea, son.

Scott: Why?

Bruce: Because he doesn't have a phone.

Scott: What?! What kind of a freak doesn't have a phone?

Bruce: A freak that works in the mailroom.

Scott: Ohh.

Bruce: Now go to sleep.

Scott: Dad, I can't sleep trying to piece together this sloppy narrative.

Bruce: [sighs] Why don't you try, uh, counting sheep?

Scott: [cries/whines] Ahh!!

Bruce: What? What, guy?

Scott: How can you make me think of all those slaughtered sheep bloated in the sun? [cries]

Bruce: They're not slaughtered sheep, son. They're live ones bounding over your head.

Scott: What? I thought they were dead! You didn't tell me they were alive. Dad, I was up all night tagging their toes. [cries]

[Dave enters]

Dave: What is going on around here?

Scott: [still crying] Maa! Uh uh!

[Dave goes over to Scott, who in turn clings onto Dave's arm.]

Dave: Oh, oh. There, there. What is it?

Scott: Yeah, yeah. Dad told me this "Teddy Bears' Picnic" story and it sounds like utter bullshit to me.

Dave: There, there. Just remember that your father loves you and I love you even more. . .

Scott: Okay.

Dave: . . . and if you ever use that kind of language in this house again, I'm gonna wash your mouth out with soup.

Scott: Oh.

Bruce: Uh, I think that's soap, dear.

Dave: Don't ever contradict me in front of the boy. There, there, little hero, you get some sleep. Okay.

Scott: Okay, `night mom.

Dave: `Night.

Bruce: `Night, Tiger.

[Bruce approaches Scott to give him a kiss, but Scott puts his fists up in self-defense. Bruce kisses the fists. Bruce and Dave leave, they turn out the light, and Scott is alone.]

Scott: Bullshit. Bullshit. Bullshit. Mmm, soup.

[Cut to parents' bedroom.]

Bruce: Goodnight.

Dave: So, this Teddy Bears' Picnic story isn't true?

Bruce: Um, no. Not exactly.

Dave: Well, if you weren't helping out at the picnic, where were you last weekend? Hmm?

Bruce: You think I'm having an affair, don't you?!

Dave: [shocked] An affair?!! Oh my God!

Bruce: Um, you didn't think that?

Dave: [shakes his head no.]

Bruce: Oh. Okay, I'm gonna be honest with you. I was out with a few of the guys from work. . .and a few goblins. . .and, uh, it started raining gumdrops. . .so uh. . .we happened into this wizard's tavern, and uh. . .I'm gonna be honest, we had a little too much dew to drink. So, uh. . .I thought I shouldn't drive.

Dave: Well, you did the right thing by not driving, but you should have called.

Bruce: Well, you know, it's the darndest thing, honey, um, the wizard's leaf wouldn't dial out.

Dave: Well, fine. But next time you should just try harder to get a hold of me.

Bruce: You're right, sweetie.

Dave: Alright.

Bruce: Goodnight. [turns out the nightstand's light.]

Dave: Who's Doris?

Bruce: [Turns light back on. Frantically:] Doris. Doris, Doris, uh, Doris.

Dave: Doris. A woman named Doris came to the house the other day and said she'd been meeting you for some time in sleazy motel rooms and that she was carrying your child and wanted to know what you were going to do about it, and I was just wonder who she was.

Bruce: Uh, I could see why you'd be curious.

Dave: Yes, well she did pique my interest, yes.

Bruce: Honey? She's a goat. She's a magical goat. And, she delights on playing tricks on us mere mortals.

Dave: I am so. . .relieved!

[Bruce also relieved. Both laugh.]

Dave: I feel like such an idiot.

Bruce: Don't feel like an idiot. No no, it's natural.

Dave: Oh, can you forgive me?

Bruce: I do, I do.

Dave: Oh, I should be jealous. [cuddles into covers]

Bruce: [turns out light] Yes you should.

      Clean is good, a mantra I have recently accepted.  This is mostly because through a laborious process which failed,  I lost my main partition .  The last incarnation of this system had partitions setup for Windows 98, Windows 2000, linux, a linux swap file and a FAT32 data partition (MP3s, thanks).  No matter how hard I tried, I could only boot into linux using a boot disk.  The Windows 2000 bootloader was not smart enough to load it.  Originally, I had  urlLink Red Hat 6.2 installed .  Feeling adventurous, I decided to install  urlLink CAEN linux  instead.  Who wouldn't want to run a distribution of linux created at their  urlLink own university ?!  For some odd reason, CAEN tried to use my network card at IRQ 0, which just does not work.  Also, since it is based on Red Hat 6.1, it did not properly recognize my GeForce video card.  Screw that, time to go back to Red Hat 6.2.   Oops, now that is trying to set my NIC to IRQ 0!   Screw that, lets go with  urlLink linux Mandrake .  The NIC was properly configured for IRQ 5, but it still wouldn't see my gateway.  I figured I could work on that later.  I got x windows working just fine, but by this point I figured I should get some work done.  Since all of my course hyperlinks were stored in Windows 2000, a quick reboot should get me going.   Reboot, walk away, come back to linux.  WTF?  Reboot, wait for my Windows 2000 bootloader menu to show.  Linux.  WTF?!   Reboot, look for any promising signs, boot into linux.  Try to mount my windows partition, get weird errors about bad disklabels and superblocks.  At this point, I knew what the outcome was.  My C drive got fried by Linux Mandrake because it was not smart enough to ask me where I wanted the boot information.  All of my documents from the past year, all my conversations, anything:  GONE .  Oh well, nothing I can do about it now....

      I know, I know...  this sporatic posting has  got  to stop.  I apologize.  Life has been very hectic lately, and I am just now getting used to the new semester.  Let's start from the most recent and work our way back...   Today was my first discussion section for CS 280 (C++ programming).  We went over the mysteries that are FTP, telnet, pico, and the g++ compiler.  Aside to that obvious sarcasm, the GSI (graduate student instructor (read: TA)) is quite foreign, and impossible to understand.  No longer will my prescence be necessary at that class.  During 280 lecture yesterday, I sat beside an overly stressed sorority girl.  The stereotype was in full effect, as she complained about how she had no time for programming since it was rush week and she had to party.  She also complained about the complexity of UNIX.  All she has to do was type three well-documented commands.  We are even allowed to use Visual C++ for most of the work!   Dumb blonde.   Two nights ago was scary.  The main server at The Michigan Daily went down.  All of the stories, production templates, everything.  Couldn't do anything to the server remotely, so I dragged my ass to StudPub.  Logged in at the console, and it turns out that all 4 of the data hard drives had crashed, destroyed their disklabels, and could not be accessed with AppleTalk.  After an hour of scratching my head as to what would cause the 4 data drives to crash all at once, yet keep the operating system drive intact, we decided to blame the weather.  "Lightning", we told all of the frustrated Daily staff.  Oddly enough, even without disklabels, the drives randomly came back up for an hour.  Down for 2 more hours, and now they have been up for 48.  Stability, not my concern.  Other than that, life has been boring....    Everyone needs to  urlLink tell me what makes their life interesting .

With Fabio as a guest star, and characters like "Nordic Dude #2" in the credits, it's cleary next year's blockbuster.  Stolen, again, from  urlLink X-E .

      What the hell?  My keyboard just died.  I thought maybe it was the AT --> PS/2 converter I was using, but a replacement did not improve the situation.  Then I thought maybe it was the port on my motherboard.  I found a PS/2 -- > USB converter and tried that.  I 'borrowed' a roommate's keyboard, and that worked just fine.  Feeling quite pissed off (do you have any idea how hard it is to use a computer without a keyboard?), I took the old keyboard and shook it around a bit.  The power of fear made it work again.  Now I can get back to my regular life.

      Yes,  urlLink Redhat Linux 7.0  is out, but when will we be able to download it?

I have successfully connected to one mirror site that had RH 7.0, but the did not have the CD image files (ISOs) that I wanted.  99% of older Linux distributions fail in some way on my hardware, so I figured there would be hope with the most brand new version.

      Heh, I was just kidding, folks.   I did end up going to see Phish!
The lot crowd before the show was a bit melancholy, which was most definitely caused by the combination of planes roaring directly overhead every two minutes and the slight amount of rain.  Once everyone got inside, the mood was dramatically lifted, mostly because we were no longer cold and wet.  Here is the setlist:
Set I (0:53): Come On Baby Lets Go Downtown > Moma Dance, Frankenstein, Halley's Comet > Fee, Stash 

Set II (1:12): Birds of a Feather, Tweezer> NICU > Scent of a Mule, Fast Enough for You, Piper > Character Zer0 

Encore (0:09): Sleeping Monkey > Tweezer Reprise

Short first set, eh?  The reason: GLOWSTICKS.  People throwing hundreds of glow sticks all over the arena is a cool effect in the dark smoke-saturated environment.  People throwing glow sticks at  the stage , at   the band   -- not good.  We probably missed out on two songs because of it.  Most people knew something was wrong at intermission.  The arena crowd created a cacophony after the second set which was probably the ONLY reason why Phish did an encore.  The crowd really did not deserve it.  Thus, we got two songs, and the band bowed and ran off stage.  Dodging glowsticks.  Again.  Bastard phans.

      This makes me oddly depressed.  The mere idea that the  urlLink X-33 will not fly  is troubling.  Mostly, because of the Mars Lander fiasco, NASA is not seen in the brightest of lights anymore.  The delays in developing the X-33 are mostly safety based (which makes sense if anyone remembers a  urlLink slight problem  in 1986 with the Challenger...), but these delays are not giving NASA credibility.  They need one project to work, and to work  well .  The International Space Station is still in development, and can't save them yet...

The cost is prohibitive since it uses mostly notebook parts.  Less expensive (but much larger) is the  urlLink BookPC .  This uses normal PC parts in a footprint about the size of a phonebook.  Neither of these systems are very upgradeable (Cannot upgrade anything on the Espresso, cannot put any new cards into the Book), but neither is the very popular  urlLink iMac !

       Michigan State (3-3) at (16) Michigan (5-2) 

Player to Watch: Ryan Van Dyke, QB, Michigan State. Starter has struggled since returning from injury and even got replaced last week by Jeff Smoker.  
Breakdown:
 Both sides are issuing the standard spin about this being a tough rivalry game, but reality says it's a mismatch. Despite their 3-0 start, the Spartans clearly are in a rebuilding year following a 10-2 campaign in 1999. The only consistency is RB T.J. Duckett, the nation's No. 5 rusher (148.3 yards). Michigan exploded in a 58-0 win last week and will likely go right at the Spartans' wobbly defensive front with powerful RB Anthony Thomas.

Of course the brain is going to be one of the last things to fully develop, and thus premature babies will have smaller brains.

       The world, and especially the US, is going to encounter an energy shortage in the next 30 years.  The oil supply is steady now, but it is estimated that with our current rate of extraction, that supply will be nil in 25 years.  Coal reserves can stretch out for 5 years beyond that, and then our fossil fuels are gone.  As of 1998, 89% of the energy of the world was produced from fossil fuels.  Alternative energy sources are less efficient, such as nuclear energy.  Future energy sources need to be developed.   urlLink Fusion  would be an excellent development, since power output is almost 10 times the power input.  The US has completely stepped out of the research and development of fusion power, hoping that Russia/Japan/Canada will develop the technology and license it to the world.

It has built in syntax highlighting (different elements of your code get colored differently) and smart indenting!  Smart indenting seems to be working perfectly even though it is touted as being experimental.  I place an open bracket, and the next line will be indented.  I place a close bracket, and the current line moves back 3 spaces.  Perfect.  On top of all of this, it is free.

      Well, I think it is time to change my screen name (nick, handle, whatever you want to call it).  When I first got online, I used Felix.  That was mostly on the non-elite BBSs I frequented.  By high school, I started to use Takashi000.  If you have ever seen the movie  urlLink Akira , then you might remember Takashi as a character.   If you really remember the movie,  you might realize that Takashi26 would have been a better handle.  Nah, I like zeros.  
I believe it was in my first year of college that I decided a new name was needed.  No longer a big fan of Akira, Takashi000 was retired.  The first couple years of college were some of my least stable.  During this time period, I was quite morbid, and was completely convinced that I would be dead at a young age.  There was little hope.  The only concept of hope that I had was mythical, the idea of being a  urlLink phoenix .  That is the reason behind  urlLink Phoenix26x , my current handle.
That would be the third handle I have grown out of, so maybe I should pick something a bit more permanent.  Here are the possibilities:
MikeBibik: this one shouldn't be hard to figure out.
BibikDotOrg:  why not advertise for the site at the same time?
ChaosTerminal:  ...or just advertise the weblog.
OpenBSoD:  OpenBSD is my favorite server OS, and BSoD is the Windows "Blue Screen of Death".   It's a geek pun, which is fitting for who I have become.
OpenSOB:  along the same lines as the previous.
AccordantDuality:  an artsy fartsy name.
Well, any  urlLink comments ?  Maybe I will slap a poll up later.

      Not sure who is the original source of this:

so i'm waiting for the bus at cc little to go to north campus, and this girl walks up and stands next to me.  she's hot, by the way, and she's wearing a tri-delt sweatshirt.  after i was done thinking about how hot she was, i realize that she's an idiot because i'm wearing my winter fucking coat and am still cold and she's standing outside waiting for a bus in nothing more than a sweatshirt.  well, i've probably never been more right about anything in my life.

so right when the bus is coming up she sees one of her friends - had to be in a sorority if not tridelt due to the black fuck me pants, black down north face jacket, black wool hat and black framed glasses.  she also had black sandals on - yes, it was still cold outside.

as i get on the bus, they sit down in front of me, which was nice, because remember, they're both hot.  i'm not really paying attention to anything in particular, mostly because i'm contemplating how much it sucks that i'm going to north campus to sit in a class that i don't really need to be going to anyway, and so it catches me off guard a bit when i realize what the two girls in front of me are talking about.  hard boiled eggs.  it was just weird, that's all.

so anyway, i'm listening to the girl in black bitch about how her roommate will hard boil all of the eggs in the fridge to use on salads at once, and then keep them in the egg carton so that when she wants to use an egg (god only know for what purpose - it certainly wasn't to eat, unless she was planning on inducing vomiting afterwards) she cracks it open only to find that it's hard boiled and not a raw egg. well this is where it starts to get entertaining for all of the engineers on the bus.  now, it was just about 1 o'clock when i was on the bus, so there were a lot of non-engineering students just headed back to bursley after class, and thus only about half the bus was keeping an eye on the hot chicks - you see, engineers don't come across girls much, and when we encounter hot chicks we tend to just kind of stare at them.  well, anyway, remember the girl in black was talking about all of the hard boiled eggs.

so, the girl in the sweatshirt says, rather loudly, "well, why don't you just unboil them?"

now, remember we on the bus that are paying attention are all engineers. i had already figured out that this girl was an idiot (sweatshirt in the cold), but the rest of the engineers must have been too engrossed staring at her to think much of that, so when she says the line about unboiling the eggs, one engineer just about chokes on his jimmy john's while the others stares turn from awe to amazement and shock at her stupidity - it really was funny.

so the girl in black actually notices everyone staring at them at this point, and gets a little bit freaked out.  she says something like, "what the fuck are you talking about, you can't unboil an egg", to which dumb sweatshirt girl says, sure you can, my boyfriend told me all about it.

and i'll spare you the story, but it basically involved a practical joke that her boyfriend had played on her which resulted in her cracking a raw egg on her forehead.  by now, most of the people on the bus, even the non-engineers, are trying to contain their laughter.  i really can't, and i'm pretty much laughing out loud, but only the girl in black notices.

and she gets pissed - either at the sweatshirt girl, or at everyone laughing at her, i don't know - and starts YELLING, "YOU CANT UNBOIL AN EGG".  each time she yells it, sweatshirt girl starts getting bitchier and bitchier, yelling "YES YOU CAN".  finally, the dude in front of them turns around, looks sweatshirt girl in the eye and says "you're crazy, you can't unboil an egg". this shut her up at least, and the north face girl looks really happy at being validated - i think that during the whole argument she wasn't really sure herself that you couldn't unboil an egg.

so the sweatshirt girl just sits there for a minute, and then i can hear her mumbling under her breath something about "chemicals" and "her boyfriend" and she finally tells the northface girl that "i'm sure you can somehow."

northface girl of course just yells "NO YOU CANT".

by now, most of the engineers have slapped their foreheads and left their hands there, making a pretty funny scene - a whole bunch of dorky guys holding their hands to their heads while shaking them.

the girls talked about it for a while, and finally sweatshirt girl agreed that maybe you couldn't unboil an egg.  by now, the rest of the bus was talking about it, and from the front, we could all hear a flaming homosexual music major ask, in the loudest, gayest voice possible, "Well, why *couldn't* you unboil an egg", which caused me and just about everyone else to go into convulsions of laughter all over again.

by now, we had just about reached the stop, but stupid sweatshirt girl wasn't done yet.  she had started talking about how it was tuesday, and tomorrow was wednesday, and how we should change the calendar so that wednesday was the first day in the week and tuesday was the last, so that we would have the weekend in the middle of the week.

one of the engineers to our right had had enough i guess, and interrupted the two girls to inform them that if you put the weekend in the middle of the week, it would no longer be a weekend, it would be a weekmiddle.

neither girl understood it, and while he tried to explain for a bit, we all ended up getting off the bus before he had a chance to finish.

      Server upgrade complete!   The downtime wasn't so much for the extra 128 megs of RAM I installed, but more so that I can undo the overclocking...   Unix is much better at making use of a CPU than any form of Windows.  That Celeron 366 overclocked to 550MHz without problem on my old Windows 2000 machine.  During certain activities (mostly compiling), the computer (the same CPU now in my OpenBSD machine) would completely freeze.  This is not normal for Unix, so it must be the overclocking.  Running comfortably at 366MHz, the machine should be 100% stable.

      The MP3 of the week has been updated.   urlLink Radiohead  released Kid A awhile ago, and it is a radical departure from the glory that is OK Computer.  Most of the songs grow on you, and I absolutely adore Optimistic.  The background vocals are melodic (and blend in perfectly with the simplistic guitar riffs), the main vocals are crisp, and there are enough hooks for everyone to love this song.  Not sure if this is radio-single-style quality, but it's quality nonetheless.  The lyrics have a perfect sense of sardonicism (yes, that is a word, go look it up, MOFO):

      *SPANKED*   That is all there is to it.  Java final: spank.  Anatomy lab practical final: spank.  Neither of those exams went well, to say the least.   To make matters worse, the exams were set back to back:  Java final from 6-8pm, Anatomy lab final from 8-9pm.  The fact that the exams were 2 miles apart also caused a problem.  Add in the "snow" factor, the "buses running late" factor, and the "my ride never showed up" factor, and you have a cold, late Mikey.  I got to the lab practical just in time to start, without instruction.  Luckily the lab format was "here is a hacked up animal-like thing; what is this inordinately small object inside the carcass?"  or "don't tell us what *that* object is, but tell us what it is related to in this other hacked up carcass".  Hey, all that matters is that I am done.

      Having taken both a chordate anatomy class and an evolution class, this  urlLink article about an aquatic origin for humans  is quite intriguing.  Many of the adaptations shown by humans could be explained by certain aspects of an aquatic life.   The examples they give are not in depth enough to be convincing though.  This is just an article from a popular scientific magazine, and thus hardcore facts are avoided.  Also, it seems that the researchers are jumping to conclusions.  Yes, brain size and posture could be explained by this theory.  The main problem is that there are no other concrete facts that support this idea, such as a fossil record that shows evolution of these traits.

Not that I have stopped listening to chick music ( urlLink Tori ,  urlLink LTC ,  urlLink The Sundays ) or punk ( urlLink Bad Religion ,  urlLink Millencolin ,  urlLink Pulley ,  urlLink Guttermouth ).  Lately, I have been listening to  urlLink Sloan  and  urlLink Radiohead , and a lot of rap mixed in between.  Laura and I spent a good hour downloading and listening to a bunch of old school rap songs.  Check them out  urlLink here !

      Definitely a new favorite:  urlLink Plastic.com .  It is run off the same software as  urlLink Slashdot  (called  urlLink Slash , created by the Slashdot kids), but looks much better.  The design is truly meaningless since the content is what keeps me coming back day to day.  Instead of the pure tech content of Slashdot, it seems more like a intelligent and logical version of  Salon .  The topics are just broad enough.  My only hope is that more people find this great site and use the comment system.

      So, I completely formatted my hard drive again.  At least this time I had some sort of backup!   The purpose for this format was a brief interlude with  urlLink Solaris .  Since Solaris 8 does not support my GeForce video card, my resolution topped off at 640x480 in glorious black and white. Pathetically, Solaris doesn't support any of the video cards I have in my Box 'O Random Hardware.    The BORH is actually much lighter than usual since I offloaded 4 modems, 2 sound cards, 4 hard drives and 1 floppy drive on my grandfather.  I just hope I have enough hardware to build a spare computer...  Anyway,  urlLink eBay  might be the source for Solaris solace, since I could get a supported vid card for like $20.

      Well, another semester ends as does the era of another of my computers.  I have upgraded from an Asus P3V4X motherboard with 256 megs of PC133 ram and a 550MHz PIII (Overclocked to 623MHz).  The new system sports a Biostar (AKA cheap) motherboard with 256 megs of PC1600 DDR ram and a 900MHz Athlon (Overclocked to 1.017GHz).   My fastest Quake III demo numbers for the old system were around a max of 69.4 FPS.  The new system pulls around 106.9 FPS!   Nice.

      I've never been called a racist in my life, nor do I believe that I ever will.  When most people (especially men) are accused of being racist, they vehemently exclaim "But some of my friends are black!".  This may very well be true, but well assured that these 'black' friends act more 'stereotypically white' than the average.  I could almost say that I fall into this category.  Two friends of mine are just these sort of friends.  They have normal midwestern accents, wear t-shirts and average clothes you can find at the mall, etc etc.  Lastly, they have extreme public courtesy.  The public editor of the Chicago Tribune comments on the  urlLink lack of public courtesy  that some blacks have.  By the way, the editor is also black.  Does agreeing make me racist?  No, I equally discriminate against anyone that pisses me off.

      So, I have to get up before 8 AM in Ann Arbor for the first time in almost 2 months.  This is due to a major server upgrade to the most important software package at work (gotta upgrade the only NT server to Service Pack  6a, then install a JVM for EJB).  Since I usually wake up around 11, breakfast is more a lunch issue.  Today, I decide to eat the remaining packets of Quaker Instant Oatmeal.  Open the package, what do I find?   Larvae!  The package was completely infested in some sort of insect.  Jamie almost puked, and I decided I wasn't so hungry anymore.

      I have no shame.  A few days ago I was looking for emulators on the web.  Finding a free Gameboy emulator proved almost impossible but I found a  urlLink Java Gameboy emulator .  Other than the lack of sounds, it is quite amazing.  I started Java programming (Java, Java servlets, and JavaServer Pages) recently, and the code to the emulator is understandable and clean.  As with most applets, don't try to run it on a Mac; it crashed IE 5.  The next discovery was the No$ (no cash) emulator.  With a name like No$, I am thinking free.  Five minutes into playing  Pokemon , the game quits and the program pops up with "Pay us or you only get 5 minutes of playing at a time!!".  Bastards.  Didn't I say I had no shame?  Well, yes, the only reason I wanted these emulators was to play Pokemon!  And play Pokemon I have!  I have put over 8 hours into Pokemon Silver in the past three days.  Does that mean I found a free emulator?  No, but I found a way to circumvent the No$ 5 minute rule...   Want a copy?  Come and get  urlLink it .

      Sick of spending most of my days just trying to find something to keep myself busy, I have decided to get some certification.  The first one will be  A+ , which most people think is a joke.   I figure I can get this certification with no training.  It covers basic hardware skills and DOS/Windows skills.  The hardware portion is as basic as "Is this a power supply or a video card?", but gets a bit more difficult with "Is this RAM chip ECC or not?".  What they call the Operating Systems Technology is just an overview of DOS/NT/Win9x/Win2K.  The OS exam covers basic Windows installation, troubleshooting and networking.  If I can't pass these tests, my legacy as a failure will go down in history.  If (once) I pass these exams, I will try my hand at something actually difficult.  Too bad there isn't a generic sysadmin exam.  There are exams for  urlLink linux sysadmin ,  Redhat sysadmin ,  urlLink Solaris sysadmin , and  urlLink AIX sysadmin .  If there was a BSD sysadmin cert, I would be all over it.

Basically, it is a complete rewrite of the Content Management System (CMS) I wrote for the  urlLink daily .  Now that I know the error of my ways from the first attempt at a CMS, I can do this one right.  So far, I have added (or plan on adding) a completely modular approach, automatic archiving, web-based configuration, a database backend and most importantly, the ability to create sites that have infinite depth.  Each template can reference a previous template, which could itself reference a previous template and so on.  Try writing a database for that one!  Other than that, life is good.

      I hate the  urlLink Ann Arbor   urlLink Art   urlLink Fair .  The fair has yet to begin, but the annoyance flows strong today.  I live on South University, which is currently covered in canopies full of 'art'.  I work on Maynard, which is currently covered in canopies full of 'art'.  The places I eat, sleep and work are overrun, and the fair hasn't even started yet.  Life will get much worse when the tens of thousands of people begin to slowly crawl from canopy to canopy, either feigning a vague interest in the life work of an artist or exclaiming praise for the bravura.

       urlLink 241st !   Ya know, I am not sure why my RC5 output is increasing so much lately.  I actually disabled the client on my main server at home.  The server is stuck between two dressers and has a second server sitting on top of it.  Needless to say, the air flow isn't so great and the temperature was simply too hot when running the proc at 100% 24/7.  Maybe someone else is cracking for me...   That would make for a pretty cool trojan/virus.  Have it simply install dnetc then attempt to infect other computers.  When it was finally discovered,  urlLink distributed.net  would be shut down, but hopefully not until I had won the $1000 prize.

      I just found my  urlLink new cell phone .  I have put off buying one for almost a year now.  The pager provided by work is just not enough to keep my in touch with everyone.  I have had two instances where people needed to get in touch with me and the pager has failed.  The main problem is that the pager is connectionless communication.  Someone dails and number or sends an email, but they get zero confirmation that the page was actually received.  With a cell phone, you know if you get through instantaneously.  Pagers should be banned.

       Two months ago, I would never have thought that a significant portion of my computing time would involve Linux.         This semester, I am in EECS 481, Software Engineering.  I would give you a link to the class homepage, but the professor decided the content isn't for the common man -- it's password protected.  The core of this class is a single, monolithic (redundant repetition, I know) project.  The only constrain to this project is that it must concern a certain  domain .  The domain for this semester is the software process.  How self-referential is that?  Our software project must be about the software process.   
        We decided on a project manager with some automatic environment creation scripts.  Basically, the manager of a software company would use a Windows front end to manage his developers.  He could see what projects they are working on, what experience they have, etc etc.  Whenever he had a new project, he could select which developers should work on it and click a single button to setup a few necessities:  A web site, mailing list and CVS repository for the new project.  
        We needed a server-class operating system for the backend.  Though I know  urlLink OpenBSD  fairly well (going on 2 years admin experience), we chose  urlLink RedHat  7.2.  The decision was made simply because of the greater install base of RedHat.
        When I first started developing the backend scripts (I did it since no one else had the experience to correctly setup Majordomo and Apache, let alone know how to write Perl scripts), I used VMWare on my main machine.  VMWare made my life much easier as I tested these scripts.  Before I would do a new install of the scripts, I would backup my entire RedHat machine with two clicks.  If the install went haywire (which it often did), restoration was as simple.  
        Enter my new laptop: a used IBM Thinkpad 600.  Ever since I got this thing, I have taken it to every class and worked on code while the professors droned on and on.  I got the idea of working on the scripts while in class.  RedHat 7.2 installed beautifully.  Slowly but surely, my Windows XP partition is touched less and less.  The laptop boots into Linux by default.  
        Linux  and open source software has improved dramatically since I last used it (RedHat 6.2 days).  AbiWord reads most Word files cleanly (other than tables, bleh!),  urlLink Mozilla  0.9.9 is now my default browser EVERYWHERE (the Macs at work, my Windows XP machines, this laptop), and I just found a new love:   urlLink Ximian Red Carpet .  Think  urlLink Windows Update  on steroids.  I will be trying  urlLink Ximian Desktop  next.
        Expect more reports on my new love.

      Eric and I had planned on playing street hockey with the same bunch of people we played with a couple weeks ago.  Some of them were still learning to skate; none of them had played street hockey for more than a couple months.  Needless to say, the games were fun and low on competition.  Today, none of them could make it.  Knowing that lots of people play at Elbel field, we headed down there.  About 8 guys were playing and there was an 9 year old boy trying to keep up with them.  Seeing such a group, we knew they couldn't have been too good.  Turns out, they were all better than the two of us, but we held our own.    After an hour and a half of playing, a few more guys showed up.   Slowly as these people started to sub in, Eric and I noticed how outclassed we were.  I thought they were just good amateurs with a cocky attitude.  When we finally left, Eric told me he found out that they were on the UMich hockey team!  Man.  No wonder.

I used to get their #6 (basic veggie sub) all of the time, but switched to the #5 (the Vito, an Italian sub comprised of salami, capicola, provolone, veggies and vinaigrette) after my first taste.

      Did you know that you still need to pay parking meters after 10 PM?  Did you know that there are handicapped meters?  (I bet you know where I am going with this one).   Laura is sick and last night she asked if I could bring her some sorbet.  I parked on South University (in Ann Arbor) about three blocks from her apartment and right between an ice cream shop (Stucchi's) and a store (Village Corner).  I got the sorbet, dropped it off, visited for about 15 minutes and went back to my car.  In my door handle I was greeted with a $75 fine!  I am pretty sure I will be able to appeal this ticket.      I am still not sure if you have to pay a meter after 10 PM.  Most university meters are only checked until 6 PM.  I had no idea that handicap-only meters exist.  Since I didn't think I had to put money in the meter, I didn't see that this was a handicap-only meter.  I was getting ice cream for my sick girlfriend!

      Point of the following story:  We gambled and won!  Eric's sister decided to go to  urlLink Joe Vision  last night to see game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals.  Since Eric is leaving for Alaska on the 18th, we have been trying to hang out as much as possible.  The two of us decided to meet his sister and her friends down in Detroit.    Since we left just after I got home from work, I was starving.  We both thought of what quick and cheap restaurants were on the way from Ann Arbor to downtown Detroit.  One restaurant shone above the rest:   urlLink White Castle !  There is a White Castle at Telegraph road just off 96.  Obviously, you can't go to White Castle without getting burgers, but we also caved into the novelty of Chicken Rings.  They are tasty and easy to eat; the perfect food.  While there, this fairly large female bus driver asked us both "How do you keep your feet so purdy?".  I said something about how my feet weren't 'purdy' and that they were also burnt from being out in the sun all day yesterday.  She didn't care, as she continued to comment on our toes and heels.  Foot fetish in a White Castle, I know.  Back to food:  between the two of us, we had 8 burgers, 9 chicken rings, 2 orders of fries and a couple Cokes.  During the first period at the Joe, my stomach was in a raging battle against said food items.  I won, if only for the fact that I didn't have to poop at JLA.  That is a decisive win against White Castle.

       urlLink Neverwinter Nights  is out!  A friend, his girlfriend and my roommate all bought copies on the first day.  Thankfully, I got to play for about an hour yesterday.  The single player mode is a bit dry so far, but I only played for an hour!  I really can't decide whether or not I like it.  The interface is a bit clunky due to the Sims-esque circular navigation.  If you haven't played either of these games, the navigation starts by clicking on an object (right-clicking for NWN).  The click brings up circular icons in a circular pattern around whatever you clicked.  You are then required to click on one of these circular icons.  If there is more than one such level of navigation, a new set of circular icons in a circular pattern pops up.  If not, then your selection has been made.  Belanger and I discussed the merits of this game and decided that multiplayer games with a DM on an isolated server are where this game will shine.  People are going to start making modules soon, too.  This could be the next Counterstrike.

      I saved myself $100 yesterday!  I bought a fairly nice Sony CD Walkman last summer (the previous version of  urlLink this model ).  I only used it probably 30 times since I bought it, mostly working out.  Back in the day, I would bring a CD player wherever I would do homework, but now I just bring my  urlLink laptop .  Well, sometime last semester, something in my CD player broke.  The lid would never stay shut.  If the lid is open, the player automatically turns off.  Yesterday, I probably killed two hours just looking at new CD players.  I finally decided on  urlLink this one  since it is a Sony, thin, and can play MP3s.  Yes, it's in girly blue, but I like girly blue!  (You should see some of the shirts I have...)  Before ordering it, I thought I might as well try to fix my old player.  How could it hurt?  I was going to buy a new one anyway!  I ripped it open, moved the lever a bit and it worked!   Well, by "worked" I mean the lid would stay shut.  I got all excited and decided to go work out, just to try it out.  After changing, getting a Nalgene bottle ready and downing some Creatine (you think I am joking?), I tossed some batteries into the old player.  Nothing.  Press play.  Nothing.  Sigh.  I ripped it open *again*.  I couldn't see anything wrong, though I did have to disconnect a cable to reset the lever.  I reseated said cable.  Nothing.  Just then, I noticed a little piece of plastic sitting in my lap.  How it stayed there for the fifteen minutes between when I first opened the player to when I noticed it is beyond me.  I figured where it went (another lever that pushed down a little button when the lid is closed) and wham.  I was off to the  urlLink CCRB  listening to  urlLink Trail of Dead .

      Perl is frustrating me.  Stupid websites are frustrating me.  Whenever a site doesn't include a feature I need, I usually end up including it for them.   urlLink OpenBSD.org  doesn't have a search engine, so I fired up  urlLink ht://Dig .  Now, a certain music review site lists old reviews alphabetically.  What a mess!  I am trying to use perl to spider through the entire site and dump most of the info to a database.  The main perl module for web data harvesting is  urlLink LWP , but it took me about 3 hours to get it installed.  It has 35,836 different dependencies and it just would NOT install on an OpenBSD 3.0 box through CPAN.  I finally got it to work using CPAN on a 3.1 box.  I should have tried the port first, but oh well.  More to come.

      In my opinion, once you hit the age of 22, no one will still consider you young.  21 is an odd age:  you are old enough for almost all responsibilities but society does not consider you an adult.  This summer I will hit 22 and it is about time to start saving for my retirement.  With the little research I have been doing so far, there have been two main points driven into me:  Diversify your portfolio.  Have a 6-12 month cushion in liquid assets in case of emergency  Most households have less than a years worth of income in  total  wealth.  ( urlLink Actual values :  Income:  $42,148.

      One of the oldest questions in history is, "What came first, the chicken or the egg?" One of the oldest answers to that question was given by Aristotle, who stated that it was, in fact, the chicken. The philosopher postulated that while a chicken is an actual chicken, an egg is potential chicken. Since actuality always precedes potentiality, the chicken came first.

      Lets see, what's been going on lately?  I scheduled the second portion of the A+ certification exam for this Thursday.  If the difficulty of this exam is on par with the first portion, I have already passed.  All of the interns are going to a  urlLink Tigers  game on Tuesday.  I have only been to a handful of baseball games in my life and this will be the first time I have gone to the new stadium.  Honestly, I hope all the money that is being dumped into Detroit does some good.  Compuware is moving their headquarters down there, we have the casinos now, Ford Field will be the new home of the Lions, etc etc.  Time will tell, as will the census.  If the population reaches a million again, that is a good sign.  I saw UFC 38 last night.  The only fight that was truly interesting was Genki Sudo versus Leigh Remedios.  Sudo came out looking like a WWE wrestler, so I already hated him.  When the fight started, he was throwing out taunts like candy and just acting cocky.  Turns out, this ploy worked as it threw off Remedios' game.  Sudo finished him with a lightning fast rear naked choke.  Now I like this guy.  Speaking of UFCs and Detroit, Chris was telling me that the one that was held in Detroit was a complete disgrace.  To allow the fights in Michigan, there could be no punching.  How is that mixed martial arts?  The pay-per-view numbers were *halved* for the next UFC.  Good job, Detroit.  The tag line for UFC 38 was "Brawl in the Hall", as it was held at Royal Albert Hall in the UK.  Chris and Marty couldn't remember the tag line for the Detroit UFC, so we decided it had to be "Motor City Mayhem", "Motown Showdown" or "D-town Beatdown".  So cheesy.

      One of my coworkers is really into home automation.  He showed me how his entire house is controllable through the web.  It even keeps logs of all the activity.  A lot of geeks are worried about the uptime of their servers.  His house has a whole list of uptimes such as "Living Room Lamp 1, In the OFF state for 1 day, 13 hours, 5 minutes and 36 seconds".  He can tell when the garage door is open, who has called and how long they talked, the temperature of each room, etc etc.  He uses  urlLink HomeSeer  software and a lot of products from  urlLink smarthome.com .  You know those damned X10 pop-under ads?  Well, it turns out that X10 is actually a protocol for home automation and that no one that does home automation really buys from the official X10 company.  Back to that "entire house is controllable through the web" bit:  Combine an always-on DSL connection and a weak password, and someone can hack your house.  Tip:  don't use your first name as your username with a single repeating character as your password.

      So, I get home from work a bit late today, 5 PM to be more exact.  As I pull into my parking lot, I hear a cacophony of high pitched squeals and beeps.  Annoyed though intrigued, the sounds seemed familiar.  As I get closer to my apartment door, I realize almost simultaneously that the sound is coming from my apartment and is the sound of six smoke detectors going off at once.  Can someone cautiously bust into an apartment?  I did just that.  No smoke.  IRON ON AN IRONING BOARD!  But it was cool and non-burning.  RUN UPSTAIRS.  Nothing.   W h a t  t h e  h e l l . . .    The usual way to get the damned smoke detectors is to find the one that is being set off and then flagellate a large cloth object (usually a bath towel) in its general direction.  No smoke means no amount of flagellating will help.  By this point, I am almost completely deaf.  The sound is so much, I cannot even tell where it is coming from any more.  All of the detectors are on the same circuit, so I started disconnecting them one by one.  Being just under 6 foot tall, the detectors were *just* out of my reach to be grabbed down and disconnected.  Damn it all, I just started ripping them down cautiously (again, if possible).  I got 5 of them (the sixth was already disconnected) but the sound continued!  I was so deaf that I couldn't tell if the ones I had just removed and tossed to the floor were still sounding or if there was a hidden detector, or if the sound was all in my head.  After an eternity of going nuts, the detectors timed out and the silence was deafening.  None of my roommates were home, there was no smoke, it made no sense.  Thinking of how great my luck is, I knew that if I left all of the detectors disconnected there *would* be a fire.  Replaced the two downstairs:  no problem.  Replaced the one in the upstairs hall: no problem.  Replaced the ones in the other bedrooms:  no problem.  Replace the one in my bedroom:  FUCKING DEAFENING CACOPHONY GETS REVENGE.  You know that little confused path that people comicly take when they don't know where to go or what to do?   You know, rush off in one direction, quickly reverse, spin around in a circle then just charge forward?  I did just that, in my own room, in my own apartment.  Ripped down the detector in my room and the sound stopped.  All of this chaos because a single smoke detector isn't working properly.  I still can't hear right.

      &lt;Crazy Waiter Story&gt; So, after Chris' amateur martial arts fight in Rochester Hills on Saturday, we all went to Red Robin in Novi.  We knew our waiter had lost it when our first impression of him was seeing him dance to YMCA with extreme fervor.  Over the course of the night, he asked us if we had ever been to Philadelpia (all because the Rocky theme song was being played), asked us if we liked the Shining (all because of a picture of Jack Nicholson with glowing eyes), explained the entire story of the Shining (even though we all knew it), forgot Lauras drink, forgot Lauras food, then gave us an extra pitcher of beer to make up for his insanity.  His excuse was that he had been working since 10 AM (and it was already midnight).  My reasoning states that he is always like that in a ploy to get better tips. &lt;/Crazy Waiter Story&gt;

      "If you could change one thing about yourself what would it be?":    I honestly wish I was more naturally outgoing.  I may seem outgoing, but it's not always me.  When I was younger, I was very shy.  With my friends in my neighborhood, I was a normal kid.  In school, I was pretty damned quiet.  Every year in elementary school, I was in some sort of accelerated program.  Not with other kids, but they would make something up for me.  When I was in first grade, I had to go to one of the second grade classrooms for reading.  Stuff like that.  That definitely made me an outcast.  I had very few friends at school, and until I started playing sports during recess I rarely hung out with anyone.  I was still very quiet until 9th grade.  At that point, I more or less forced myself to be outgoing.  I started cracking jokes, being a loudmouth, being very opinionated, etc etc.  It still feels like a show, a farce, to this day.

      The English language just has to go.  There are too many inconsistancies and annoyances.  Why must both the present and past tense of "to receive or take in the sense of (as letters or symbols) especially by sight or touch" be "read"?  Obviously, that's is fine for the spoken word, but not for written!

      Twice in three days:   Chris and I were mucking around with his OpenBSD firewall, trying to recover data from a dead drive.  This box is his firewall, file and NAT server.  Without this box, no internet.   While we were waiting for it to reboot, I was thinking of things to do.  "Oh, go to www.somesite.com."  "Uh...".   D'oh, right, no internet access.     Just today, I had to restart my web proxy.  "What can I do while I wait for the web proxy?  Ah, go to slashdot!"  Uh... Right, again, no internet access.  Is it a bad sign when you just assume that you have a 24/7 broadband connection?

      Geek humor (in reference to anti-gravity), curtesy of  urlLink Slashdot :   Since we all know that   1. Cats always land on their feet, and  2. A buttered slice of bread will undoubtedly land on the carpet butter side down,   we could strap said buttered slice of bread onto the cats back, then drop the whole thing to the floor.  Retort:  This fails both under quantum physics and general relativity.  Under the quantum physics interperetation, since both the cat's feet and the buttered toast are equally likely to land on the floor, the cat-toast enters a superposition where both cat and toast are simultaneously on the floor until it is observed, at which point a radioactive particle decays, and the cat is skinned in a number simultaneous, equally likely, yet distinct ways.  Relativity predicts that the intense attraction to the floor will, in fact, bend space-time in such a way that the floor actually is in contact with both the cat and the toast. If the cat is of the black variety, then it will thus cross its own path, generate a singularity, and vanish in a puff of logic.  The debate continues, as attempts at experimental verification have thus far failed. Dr. Kibble at Princeton's IAS said "Look, have YOU ever tried to hold a cat still and strap some friggin' TOAST to its back?"

      I was only awake for about 50 minutes today, my 22nd birthday, when I got my first present!  At about 7:55 AM, I heard my car alarm go off.  That could mean only one thing, I was getting towed again!  I scampered down there, barefoot, just as the tow truck guy was putting braces on my rear wheels.  Seems that my forged permit was fading so fast that it was quite obvious.  Just yesterday I noticed that the text was a lot closer to yellow than to the expected red.  Long story short, the tow truck guy remembered how nice I was the last time he tried to tow me, so he let me go with just a $40 fee.  Come to think about it, I only paid $120 this entire summer to park in my lot ($80 fee a month ago, $40 fee today).  Not bad for four months of parking!

      Here is a little perl script that I wrote for work over the past couple days.  Basically, our E10K (named CAD) had a hardware failure and the Oracle database struggled to come back up afterward.  The senior UNIX admin was having trouble getting a Korn shell script to correctly report whether or not a process was running.  Originally, this perl script would just grep the process list for one specific process and then shoot off an email to a list of admins.  Now, it will look for any number of processes and send emails to any number of specified admins.  The comments should explain it all.  The only line that might need some explanation is this one:  foreach $recipient_number (@{$process_recipient_bridge[$process]}) { process_recipient_bridge is an array of arrays (or list of lists, if you will).  I want to get access to one of those internal lists.  To get a single element in an array of arrays, you would use $array[index1][index2].  To get a whole array out, you still use $array[index1], but then you have to cast that as an array:  @{$array[index1]}.  If you want to run this on a BSD, OS X or Linux system, make sure that you change "ps -ef" to "ps -ax" and "mailx" to just "mail".

      So, my favorite field is finally starting to produce fruit:  urlLink I Can See  ( urlLink Wired cover ).  Ever since I read all 5 pages of this article this morning, my mind has been awhirl.    First, the techology behind this is amazing.  The camera, not amazing.  The computers, not amazing.  The software, not amazing.  The neural implant, bingo.  If you have read the article, you will know that this implant sits directly atop the visual cortex.  The resolution is not that high, but it does allow the user to perceive objects.    Second, I am rethinking my future plans again.  Cybernetics is now, the proof is here!  This is just the beginning, this is just what the public knows.  I am sure that many of my dreams will be realized by the end of my lifetime (which should hopefully coincide with the end of this century).  Why should I limit myself to basic computer support work my entire life?  Why should I try to get an MBA and join the management track before I am 28?  Technology and cybernetics are two true loves.  Repairing vision (of this fashion) is simple in comparision to what is possible!  Maybe I should have stuck with my plan to become a biomedical engineer.  Too bad UMich didn't offer a BME undergraduate degree when I was applying.  Third, I really want to watch  urlLink Ghost in the Shell  again.

      A new project I would like to work on:    A simple BSD or Linux boot disk that contains a few utilities for testing for a hacked box.  Initially, the system administrator would boot off this floppy and run the initialization utilitity.  It would take an MD5 hash of all the files in specific directories (such as /etc, /bin, /sbin and /usr/bin) and store the results in a text file.  Later on, the system administrator could boot off this floppy again and run the comparison utility.  It would take another MD5 hash of all the files and compare the results.  Doing this in BSD would be easier for me because I have access to many BSD machines.  Doing it in Linux would make it much more widely supported.  Can the stock Linux kernel mount FFS file systems?  I know OpenBSD can mount Ext2 file systems.  Red Hat now uses Ext3 by default, so it would only work with older RH systems.  Hopefully I will be able to create a boot disk that would work with most any unix system.  This project could also use  urlLink Tripwire  or a  urlLink pre-made system disk .  Or maybe I will just do it all from scratch just to be a jerk.

I just thought the regular bassist was taking some time off, so the guy from the Cudas joined them.  It's completely the other way around.  No wonder I was so confused, and no wonder there was such conflict, and no wonder his voice is that much better.

      Laura and I went to the Hot Snakes show last night at the Magic Stick.  Neither of us had been there, so we had a bit of difficultly parking.  We found the actual place just fine, but we had to settle for street parking a couple blocks away.    To summarize the Magic Stick:  Hellhole.  The main room isn't too bad, though a bit run down.  The pool tables are all 7 footers, and are thus worthless.  The bartender was quite the jerk, but what else would I expect?  The bathroom was, by far, the worst of it all.  Laura was so disgusted by the her bathroom that she wouldn't even describe it.  The mens room had two stalls and two urinals, yet no stall doors or seats even.  The funniest part was there was just a random roll of toliet paper sitting toward the middle of the room.  Who would use that?  No door, no seat, just a random roll sitting in the filth of many punks?  I will pass.  Strike one.  I knew there were supposed to be two opening bands, but I figured they would start playing soon after the doors opened.  We got there at 7:30 PM, the doors didn't open until 8 PM, yet we waited and waited and waited.... The first band (Red Hot Legends) finally started at 9:30 PM!  They sucked.  Musically, not bad.  Their vocalist, on the other hand, was so horrid that we couldn't understand a single lyric.  Strike two.  A good 40 minutes after the first band screeched to a halt, the second band (The Cudas) got on stage.  Musically, pretty basic without flourish, melodical but plodding.  The band had two main singers and a female backup singer/keyboardist.  You could just tell the two guys were vying for top spot in the band.  The guy who called the shots was a cheesy chach, the other guy had a much better voice.  Gotta love band conflict.  Their lyrics though, simply pathetic.  Strike three.  Finally, praise god, the Hot Snakes got on stage sometime after 11 PM.  I am not even sure when they started, my eyes were watering because I was so over tired.  Without any build up or chatting with the audience, they launched into I Hate the Kids.  I was a bit unsure of their quality live at first, but then I think their sound engineer tweaked something.  The sound was very faithful to the albums, but with pure raw energy.  They also played 10th Planet, Automatic Midnight, If Credit Matters I'll Take Credit, Light Up The Stars, No Hands, Our Work Fills The Pews, Past Lives, Gar Forgets His Insulin, XOX, Who Died, Suicide Invoice and Ben Gurion (wow, I remembered almost all of them).    Laura and I actually left during their show because I was so tired.  Hopefully I didn't miss much.  Luckily, I got to hear my favorite three songs (I Hate The Kids, If Credit's What Matters I'll Take Credit and Suicide Invoice).  It's so hard to rock out when you have to get up before 6 AM the next day.  The show was amazing, thus all strikes are taken back.

      And I thought acid was bad:  Laura's older sister Carolyn was housesitting/catsitting for some friends these past two weeks.  15 days of this, which was supposed to end yesterday.   Since the couple was supposed to be back last night, Carolyn went home.   She got a phone call around 11 PM from the FIRE MARSHALL.     It seems that the dryer caught on fire and burned up half of the basement.  They found her cell phone number on a note upstairs and called her.   Luckily the fire caused a water pipe to rupture, helping quench the flames.  She was okay, the cats were okay, no one was hurt.   More luck for that family.

      And I thought wasps were bad:  Laura works at the School of Public Health as a lab technician.  The lab she works in deals with air purity/polution.  The air and water samples they collect are stored in generic glass bottles.  To insure that these bottles are free from impurities, they are washed in acid, baked in acid then cleaned with various other techniques.    Just the other day, Laura was doing the usual routine of cleaning bottles when she accidentally dropped a bottle of acid into a sink.  The acid bottle was open since she was using it, thus acid splashed up and into her EYE.  She immediately used the eye wash, which I believe saved her.  Though she could see just fine after it happened, she decided to go to the ER just to be sure.  They flushed both eyes with a liter of saline each then examined the damage.  Just a small amount of corneal abrasion which healed quickly.  Thank god.

      The things a boy will do for internet access:   As most of you know, I am back at my parents house for two weeks this summer.  During this time, my only home net access will be dial up.  This would be bearable if I could actually make a connection!  I dial up my umich account and the connection will die within 20 minutes (usually after only 1 minute).    I called up Ameritech and they said it could be a problem with the line, or it could be internal wiring.  If the wiring was the case, then they would charge us just to come look at the problem.  He suggested that I connect a modem directly into the interface on the outside of the house.  Problem, my computer is in the basement.  Luckily, I am sometimes smart.    I found a phone cord long enough so that I could run it from the external interface, through the bathroom window and then *down* the laundry chute into the basement.  Unluckily, the external interface is behind a  urlLink rose of sharon  bush (Hibiscus syriacus).  Guess what likes to hang out around these bushes?  Wasps!  I got stung four times, including twice *in the face*.  All for dial up access.

      As much as I hate using this page as a place to rant, sometimes it has to be done.  The first assignment for my senior design project is due this Wednesday.  Basically, it is a presentation that explains the requirements of the project.  In order to do the presentation, we need to have a good idea of what the project will be.  Since our project was pretty open-ended, that required meeting with the client (in this case, the biomedical engineering professor).  Professors are busy people, and thus he could not meet with us until today.  He found an opening in his schedule and emailed us at 11:15 AM saying he was free from noon until 2 PM.  None of my other group members could make it, which is understandable given the short notice.  Thus, I had to meet with the professor by myself, while still extremely sick.  Luckily, I was able to be partially coherent and not spray snot all over his office walls.  Since I am poor and car-less, I took the bus from north campus back to central campus after the meeting.  There was one kid standing up in front of my seat while myself and the kid next to me were trying to get off the bus.  I let the kid next to me get up first, then I started to stand up.  When the first kid got up, the guy that was standing slid back and was directly in front of me.  Without even looking above me, I stood up.  I stood up directly into the guys elbow.  Crack, right on top of my head.  Now my leg and my head hurts.

      A sinus infection has left me completely incapacitated.  I had to skip class yesterday, and I may do the same today.  I woke up this morning feeling like I had the worst hangover of my life.  My stomach hurt, my head was throbbing and my muscles were sore.  Yesterday, my nose was leaking like a burst water main.  It was quite odd, minding my own business, playing on the computer, then feeling a hot river of snot pour from my nose with undying fury.  The taste, that was what got to me the most.  Today, my combination of ibuprofen, asprin, claritin, generic over-the-counter decongestant and antihistamine and mulit-vitamins might keep this sickness in check

      I finally got my MDE project:   We run some large image processing tasks that run over many processors.  We've developed our own code to distribute computations over several Unix systems, but it's really out of date.  In particular, we need to take advantage of the compute power in Linux clusters.  We have our own small cluster and we would liek to exploit the capabilities of the large cluster in the Center for Parallel Computing.  One of my students provided the following request.  I think this would make a great senior design project with real applicability in the commercial world....   How about a tool set for running background C code or MatLab jobs.  Kind of like the launch program, but for use on our local Athlons.  A script would detect what machines are idle and launch jobs in a joblist serially.  Alternatively, and even better, they could get an account at the Center for Parallel Computing for the Athlon clusters.  These clusters use SMP parallel computing additions to the C language.  For independent C processes like our tracking, it would not be that hard to write scripts that modify the C code so it can run on these Athlon clusters, and maybe even automatically launch it and give feedback in the process.  So users can run independent C code on these systems without having to learn the SMP additions or details about the parallel cluster.  Automatic transfer of files without interactive authentication and big/little endian compensation may pose some challenges.  This is a seriously under-developed project description.  We are going to have a meeting with the professor that suggested this project to get some solid details.  The cool part about this professor is that he works in the biomedical engineering department.  My bio degree will make it easier to get in his head.

      I have another project to add to my list.  Hopefully I will finish one of these this semester.  For the sake of argument, I will define the "lifespan" of an operating system to be from the day it is released to the public (either for purchase or for download) to the time *two* new versions of the operating system have come out.  An example would be  urlLink OpenBSD 2.9 .  It was released on June 1st of 2001.  Since  urlLink OpenBSD 3.1  (the second version past 2.9) came out on May 19th of 2002, the lifespan of OpenBSD 2.9 was 06/01/2001 to 05/19/2002.  Over the lifespan of OpenBSD 2.9, there were 27 different patches.  That might not seem like much, but that is over two patches a month.  For a company that has many servers, that could be a lot of patching.  Likewise, the current version of OpenBSD (3.1) has 14 patches already.  That version had only been available for under three months when the last patch was issued.  Now that I have that cleared up, time for the actual project:  An OpenBSD version of  urlLink Windows Update .  Since no self-respecting BSD admin would go to a website for their patches, BSDUpdate would be a command-line tool.  It would check the current state of your system, verify which patches were needed, and download them.  The tool can then install the patches and restart services as/if necessary.  The tool could also be put in "automatic mode" and placed into a cron job for completely seamless updating.  This is actually a very easy project (but also time consuming).  Nevertheless, I will be damned if I ever finish it.

      School started this week, which is the main reason why my post frequency has dropped to near-zero.  My classes for this term include Operating Systems, Molecular Biology and the Major Design Experience.    Operating Systems is not as cool as I thought it would be.  Instead of getting an overview of the 1.9 million topics involved with operating systems, we are only learning threads and file systems.  So disappointing.  Molecular has been good so far, which is surprising.  By now, I thought I would be horrifically sick of anything biology related.  I talked to someone new in class for the first time in practically three years, so that might help.  And finally, the Major Design Experience (MDE):  8 credits for a single project.  We were given something like 30 projects to choose from.  We got to pick our top three, then the professors will put us into groups.  My choices were:  Writing a set of UNIX/Linux tools to ease administration of a network that includes UNIX, Linux, Windows and Mac workstations.  Add an extension to the university LDAP server so that email groups can have their list archived or sent as a digest version.  Rebuild the EECS website, both the design and the database backend.  I don't care which one I get, they should all be fairly easy.  Time consuming, but easy.  Once I get into the swing of things, I am sure I will be back to posting (almost) everyday.  I don't even have a desk in my room yet, so it might be awhile.

      You know you are a software engineering geek when:    An every day problem comes along, and instead of just trying to solve it immediately, you have to plan for it.  "Well, we first have to figure out what the real problem is before we can solve it."  Then you have a requirements phase, trying to figure out what will need to be done to solve the problem.  Then you have a design phase, trying to come up with a good way to solve the problem.  Then you actually do it.  I need to spend more time with biology and less with computer science. It's pervasive.

      Sprint PCS sucks.  There is a very good reason that the greeting on my phone has been Sprint POS ever since I got it.  Let's go over what happened to me this month:  I moved from Ann Arbor to Livonia back to Ann Arbor.  I changed my address on the Sprint PCS site about a week after I moved to the new Ann Arbor apartment.  The changes just wouldn't stick.  I would change the address, save the changes, reload and the old address would be back.  I tried for about 3 days to get it to stick, no luck.  Eventually, I just couldn't log into the website.  I make all of my payments online, so this was going to be a problem when September 7th rolled around (my billing date).  Obviously, that day blew past.  I couldn't log into the website for a couple weeks and my bill was overdue.  They didn't turn my phone off for a couple weeks, so I thought I was set.  No so much.  They turned it off yesterday.  I STILL can't get into the website.  This morning, I called their customer service number.  I had to PAY $3 to get my address changed over the phone.  That is strike 1.  My new apartment is in the basement of a house.  My cellular reception is extremely spotty and random.  Sprint PCS rarely works in university buildings.  My job, classes and main study area are all in such buildings.  Thus, my cell phone only works when I am walking to and from my destinations.  What cellular provider should I go with?

I would have purchased an  urlLink IBM Thinkpad R , but whenever I would try to pick the parts I wanted, the price would always be "NA".

      Hmm, speaking of working out, I never explained how accident-prone I've been over the past few weeks.  I cut myself twice, once on a bagel when I was in a  hurry and once when chopping up peppers and I wasn't paying attention.  The pepper cut, which is on my left thumb, was so deep that I probably needed stitches.  I'm a dumb boy, so I just put a butterfly bandage on to seal it up.  When working out at the beginning of spring break last week, I was walking on my hands (a relic from my pre-wrestling work outs) and stretched out my ACL in my right knee when I landed.  Being a dumb boy, I played racquetball with Joe later that evening.  I was attempting a spinning return when I realized there was no way I could land and put that much pressure on my right knee.  I stopped midway but my racquet kept going.  I smashed myself in the left eye.  I should have taken pictures right when it happened, but here are a couple pictures from over a week after it happened:   Normal coloration   Photoshopped coloration to show bruise beneath the eye

      Crazy dream #2:  Just a few days ago I had a dream that involved moving down to Georgia.  Since I don't know anyone down there, I had to find housing by myself.  All of the apartments were full or something so I ended up subletting a room in a mansion.  The details of the mansion itself were fuzzy but there definitely was a pond in the back with some odd stones surrounding the perimeter.  (It reminded me of a  urlLink Mandelbrot set , now that I think of it.  Do you dream in fractals?  Thought not.)  The owner of the mansion and (what could only be) his young daughter showed me to a room.  They said there was only one problem, the bed had been in the pond earlier.  Eh, whatever, I took the room anyway.    
I fell asleep (in the dream) and woke up with two leech-like beings on my left hand.  I immediately started to swat at them, trying to get them off.  The owner and daughter (who must have been watching me sleep) yelled at me to stop and that these leeches would keep sucking until either they filled with blood or died.  On closer inspection, the leeches had these coiled bodies that could expand and hold a LOT of blood.  I had to get to the hospital, so I called Eric (who knows why he was in Georgia).  He picked me up in some weird Dodge Neon-SUV hybrid (which can be explained by the fact that I fell asleep reading Motor Trend) and we tried to ask for directions to the nearest hospital.  Everyone would give us directions, but different directions.  Just as we got on the highway, I woke up.  My entire left arm was completely asleep which explains the leech bit.

      Crazy dream #1:  Just after Leah and I started dating, I had a dream that I was MCing a talent show.  It was held in downtown Detroit in a dingy, 70's-styled theater.  I don't remember how it happened, but I ended up on stage and was told to MC the entire affair.  I didn't know who was supposed to be in the show so I just talked to the crowd and made a game out of it.  Rob Shereda was in the audience and I was under the impression that he was supposed to be the MC but decided to let me run it.  After introducing the first act, I hopped down from the stage into the crowd.  Everyone seemed to be dressed as if it was the 70's, but in that updated-yet-still-retro style.  Leah was there and just as I was about to talk to her, I woke up.

      I have a new  urlLink digital camera .  I haven't gotten many chances to use it, but it was put into full effect to capture a  urlLink typical night out .  Check out the rest of the galleries  urlLink here .  Hopefully that will quickly fill up with galleries from my tenth and final semester here.  Last week was spring break and mostly it was spent at work.  For those of you that haven't been dragged into the Daily by now, here is a  urlLink quick run down of the important areas .  The  urlLink really big   urlLink black server  in that gallery is the old database server that I replaced last weekend.  Other than work, I hung out with Leah as much as possible.  We went up to State for a night and that would have been a prime candidate for picture taking, but I hadn't met 90% of those people yet.  It's just better to not be "that guy that always has his camera" just yet.

      Here is some background as to what has been going on in my life the past 5 months.  First, I am seeing someone new.  Her name is Leah and to try to explain how perfectly the relationship is developing would be to spoil it.  Expect to hear more about that later.  Second, and related to the first, I'm no longer with Laura.  Things were a bit rough at the end of last semester and she decided to end it.  No hard feelings, on my part.  Third, I will be graduating come April 25th.  Fourth, I have no idea where I will be after said graduation.  There is a job possibility down in Alpharetta, Georgia, but I won't be saying any more about that until I know for sure.

      Crazy euchre story:  Leah (on the other team) was dealing and turned up a bower.  I was three-suited and called it up with NO TRUMP.  We won that hand and won the game 10-0.  Am I lucky or what?

      Homework can wait.  Tonight was the  urlLink Sarah Slean  concert!  While I was checking out  urlLink other concerts , I saw that she would be playing at  urlLink The Ark  tonight.  I knew that Jenn was a fan, so we decided to go.  I had only heard a couple of her songs quite a while ago, but I figured it would be good to go to a concert anyway.  I'm damn glad I went.  Not only was it a good time with Jenn (and seeing Beth wasn't half bad), but the concert itself was so good it was inspiring.    I really had no idea what to expect.  When a gorgeous redhead (though fake, I think) took the stage with a vivacious and humorous stage presence, I knew this was going to be good.  She has a good command over the piano, ranging from full-yet-harsh wailing to soft and melodic.  Her voice takes a bit of getting used to, but she has some power when she wants to use it.  Her lyrics were a bit obtuse for a first time listener, but that will surely correct itself over time.  Interestingly enough, her guitarist was actually the most talented person on stage.  He played four different instruments total, two electrics, one acoustic and one that could only be described as an electric tweleve-string ukulele.  With the help of at least 12 different pedals, he added a depth to the music that would have left the piano naked without.  All in all, a pretty kick ass show.  Jenn bought her newest CD and quickly sent me MP3s of all the songs when she got home.  This is definitely going into my permanent rotation.

      Another good workout followed by consuming way too much damned food.  The last time I did this I ate a bowl of tomato rice soup, a ham and swiss on sourdough, a granola bar, a yogurt and two oranges.  Today was another bowl of tomato rice soup, a veggie burger,  urlLink three pieces of cheesy bread , two huge oranges and a bag of pretzels.  For lunch!  I am glad that my goal of working out is better physical fitness and health, not overall weight loss...

      Current Reading: The Feminine Mystique, by Betty Friedan.  I've just barely started reading and I'm already hooked.  She describes the plight of the 1950s/1960s housewife so spot on and with such clarity, it borders on prescience.

      Jamie, Alissa and I just tried  urlLink Potbelly  for the first time.  Not bad!  The sandwiches are tasty and hot and cheap ($3.79).  Alissa tried the ice cream and that got a thumbs up, Jamie and I tried the cookies and they got a thumbs up.  Big thumbs down on their fountain pop though.  The cup was probably only 12 ounces yet it cost $1.39!  For $1.39, you get a 32 ounce cup at Jimmy John's.  I guess they have to make up costs somewhere.

      This has been a crazy week.  The craziest part is trying to organize one of my interviews.  When they initially contacted me a couple of weeks ago, they asked for 8 possible interview dates.  I gave them 8 and then realized a few days later that one of those dates was the same as my AI final!  Murphy's Law in full effect, they chose that day.  I emailed my contact back immediately and asked if it could be rescheduled to any of the other days.  The best she could do was to push it back a day, to April 25th.  I have finals on the 22nd, 23rd and 24th and then commencement is on the 26th.  Bad timing, eh?  So, here is a rough estimation of my schedule for those three days:  
April 24th   
	10:30 AM - 12:30 PM: Final 
	Between 3 PM and 6 PM: Fly out of DTW 
	Between 6 PM and 9 PM: Arrive 
	Afterward: Crash at hotel  
April 25th  
	6 AM: Wake up, get ready, find office 
	8:30 AM: Interview, interview, interview 
	Between 9 PM and Midnight: Fly out  
April 26th  
	Between 5 AM and 8 AM: Arrive at DTW 
	9:15 AM: Commencement  

I can't believe I am taking the redeye from an interview to catch commencement.

      I've fallen in love with two older games lately:   urlLink Gran Turismo 3  and  urlLink chess .  Yeah, chess is just a wee bit older.  
Basically, Joe tossed GT3 into the PS2 earlier this week for the first time since we've owned it.  He has only played the rally races (since he hates all of the races on pavement).  Matt and him scrapped for awhile and I tossed my hat into the ring.  I was under the impression that to correctly navigate a turn you had to be turning the whole time.  In rally, this couldn't be farther from the truth.  You turn well before the actual bend in the road and then power slide through almost every one.  I got smoked in those first few races.  After they had left, I gave the course a few more runs.  I just barely beat the course on "Easy" mode *then* I figured out turning.  Each run saw my times improving after each iteration.  Eventually, I was beating the CPU car by 10 seconds in "Hard" mode.  That is when I got hooked.  
GT3 is an extremely deep game.  Even the simplistic "Arcade" mode has 30+ tracks and too many cars for me to count.  The simulation mode has a depth I haven't quite fathomed yet.  You start off with a meager amount of money and no cars.  My first car had a whopping 116 HP to start, which was pretty depressing since Zig had a car that was pushing 1048 HP.  You can customize your car, earn driving licenses (that allow you to enter the more difficult races), and obviously race.  I've just started, but I'm sure I am going to be hooked.  
On to chess.  For some reason, Zig decided that all of his programming buddies should have a contest.  He will write a basic GUI that allows people to plug-in two chess engines and have them go at it.  I doubt I will participate (since writing a chess engine would take hundreds of hours, at least), but that got chess on our minds.  After dinner (a Tuesday night tradition with the guys), Chris and I ran to the chess store at Briarwood and picked up a chess clock.  We went back to my apartment and played four games:  Chris versus Matt, Matt versus Joe, Joe versus myself and then Joe versus Chris.  None of the games ended with a checkmate since we were playing with the clock.  The first game gave 15 minutes per person then we pulled that down to 10 minutes per game when Joe was playing.  I just didn't pay attention to the clock and I ran out of time with the game probably only half way through.  Speed chess just isn't my thing, but I at least didn't lose in less than 20 minutes total.  
Hopefully I stick with both of these games.

      I *knew* I was using that word incorrectly.  Whenever I feel like I am giving up and letting someone else have their way, I might say something about " urlLink subjugating  my will" to them.  In all reality, I have been meaning to say  urlLink abdicate !  I could say something like "I'm just allowing you to subjugate my will", but that doesn't have the same ring to it.  Say it with me: "abdicate my will", "abdicate my will" and "abdicate my will".

      Jamie, Joe and I hung out yesterday.  We just absolutely had to enjoy the weather!  The diag wasn't the most verdant place (the snow washes away yet everything is so dirty) but it was enjoyable nonetheless.  We grabbed Jimmy John's on the way then sat by the flagpole.  We mainly talked about the  urlLink night before  and how we wished it turned out just a little bit less dramatic.  As always, we also discussed the future.  I finally realized that Joe is going to be moving out of state no matter what happens.  We didn't know each other too well until this year, but I feel we've gotten close.  I'll miss him.  
Jamie and I discussed how cool it would be if we both do end up staying in the Ann Arbor area.  I now have an official job offer from a company around here, so it just might happen.  Of course I am still going to have my fly-out interviews.  We shall see.  My camera got some more use; check out the pictures from the day  urlLink here .

      Over the years, a few people I have known personally have started weblogs.  Those are always the best because you know most of the basic information about their life anyway.  The weblog is just another glimpse into their psyche.  Well, just recently, Eric started his own  urlLink weblog .  Another one of my good friends started one as well, but that is NOT for public consumption.

      Last night, Joe and I had planned a little gathering.  It was going to start with pizza, then drinking/euchre/video games and then finally going to see the midnight showing of Batman at the State Theater.  Well, the plans quickly changed.  We started off playing spades, chowing down snacks and drinking beer.  Eventually more people showed up so we got pizza, played some GT3 and broke out the hard liquor.  When it was time to leave for the movie, we voted and decided it would be more fun to stick around.  
This is when the night started to break down.  Somebody started getting pretty upset when we played Never Have I Ever, then another got upset because of sexual comments and then finally someone got violently ill.  There is still a huge mixing bowl filled with puke and a blanket covered in puke in our bathroom.  Other than that, it was great!  See the pictures  urlLink here .

      Deadly Sins  

ANGER 
1.  Who did you last get angry with?   I guess I would have to say Chris Payne.  He was acting very out of character last Saturday night. 
2.  What is your weapon of choice?   First choice is words, second choice is the fist. 
3.  Would you hit a member of the opposite sex?   Under 99.99% of circumstances, never.  The only reason I would ever hit a female would be to protect someone.  In all reality, I would probalby just hold them back if possible. 
4.  How about of the same sex?   Of course I would rail on a dude.  Dudes are made to be hit. 
5.  Who was the last person who got really angry at you?   Jamie.  Kids say the darndest things. 
6.  What is your pet peeve?   When people bite their fork.  It sounds like nails on a chalkboard and it seems so trashy. 
7.  Do you keep grudges, or can you let them go easily?   It depends on who it is against.  If it is with someone I am close to, it is usually quickly resolved.  Against someone I do not know well or do not like, it can last indefinitely.  

SLOTH 
1.  What is one thing you're supposed to do daily that you haven't done in a long time?   Use my teeth whitener.  All those years of drinking nothing but coffee and Diet Coke did a number on them. 
2.  What is the latest you've ever woken up?   5 PM.  I once pulled an all nighter and ended up going to bed around noon. 
3.  Name a person you've been meaning to contact, but haven't?  Hmm, my maternal grandmother.  
4.  What is the last lame excuse you made?   Not really an excuse, but just tonight Megan and I were at Borders.  There was a book called  Why Paint Cats  (yes, it's as weird as it sounds).  She actually bought a book called  Why Cats Paint  for her dad, so I said that this must be a sequel thus she must buy it. 
5.  Have you ever watched an infomercial all the way through (one of the long ones...)?    Never.  I don't watch TV, other than  urlLink 24 . 
6.  How many times did you hit the snooze button on your alarm clock today?   I didn't.  I don't need an alarm clock anymore.  When I quit drinking caffeine, my sleep requirements went from 8.5 hours a night to just about 5 hours a night. 
7.   How many times have you skipped work/classes this month?   Since I have a completely flexible work schedule, I cannot techincally skip work.  I think I've skipped two classes total.  

GLUTTONY 
1.  What is your overpriced yuppie beverage of choice?   SoBe green tea...   drool... 
2.  Meat eaters: white meat or dark meat?   White meat. 
3.  What is the greatest amount of alcohol you've had in one sitting/outing/event?   Probably about 14 drinks in a single evening. 
4.  What's the most you've ever weighed?  188, the weight I am at now.  Ever since I started working out almost every day, I've gained about 10 pounds.  Hopefully I've actually lost some fat and gained more than 10 pounds in muscle. 
5.  What have you eaten so far today?   Breakfast was a bowl of cereal, a bagel and a can of mixed fruit.  Lunch was a veggie sub from Jimmy John's.  Afternoon snack was crackers with peanut butter and jelly.  Dinner was another sub, this time a ham one from Potbelly.  I am sure I will eat the equivalent of another meal before I go to bed.  Working out has dramatically increased my metabolism. 
6.  When was the last time you ate so much you felt sick?   The last time I got two subs from Jimmy John's after working out.  My stomach couldn't handle it, but my body was craving nutrients. 
7.  When was the last time you got drunk to the point of throwing up?   That time I had 14 drinks in an evening.  Playing poker with the guys and going shot for shot isn't a good call.  

LUST 
1.  How many people have you seen naked (not counting movies/family)?   3 plus naked mile plus however many people were on the wrestling and football teams in high school 
2.  How many people have seen YOU naked (not counting physicians/family)?  3 plus the teams 
3.  Have you ever caught yourself staring at the chest/crotch of a member of your gender of choice during a normal conversation?   Yes. 
4.  Have you "done it"?    Yes. 
5.  What is your favorite body part on a person of your gender of choice?   Eyes. 
6.  Have you ever been propositioned by a prostitute?   No. 
7.  Have you ever had to get tested for an STD or pregnancy?   No.  

GREED 
1.  How many credit cards do you own?   I personally have 2 in my name and then there is a card that is a joint account of myself and my aunt and a debit card. 
2.  What's your guilty pleasure store?   I guess J. Crew. 
3. I f you had $1 million, what would you do with it?   I would move out of my crappy apartment, buy a few  urlLink cars  and try to invest the rest. 
4.  Would you rather be rich, or famous?   Rich.  Being famous is pointless. 
5.  Would you accept a boring job if it meant you would make megabucks?   Aren't all jobs inherently boring to some degree? 
6.  Have you ever stolen anything?    Yes.  I vividly remember taking Vaseline lip balm when I was 6. 
7.  How many MP3s are on your hard drive?   Currently, 3,898.  

PRIDE 
1.  What one thing have you done that you're most proud of?   I am not really proud of anything yet.  I will find pride when I have a happy, stable family. 
2.  What one thing have you done that your parents are most proud of?   Anything academic.  They've been proud of me so far in all aspects though. 
3.  What thing would you like to accomplish in your life?   Other than the happy, stable family, I would like to make some lasting contribution to whatever field I end up working in. 
4.  Do you get annoyed by coming in second place?   Of course!  I am more competitive than almost anyone I know. 
5.  Have you ever entered a contest of skill, knowing you were of much higher skill than all the other competitors?   Again, of course.  It's so easy to crush people that way, and crushing makes me feel whole. 
6.  Have you ever cheated on something to get a higher score?   Of course. 
7.  What did you do today that you're proud of?   I set a new max on my bench press.  I'm only at 250 pounds though.  

ENVY 
1.  What item (or person) of your friends would you most want to have for your own?   Currently, Zig's car would be nice.  I want something faster though. 
2.  Who would you want to go on "Trading Spaces" with?   Kristin Happ, since she is the only person I know that watches that show more than my parents. 
3.  If you could be anyone else in the world, who would you be?   No one. 
4.  Have you ever been cheated on?   Actually, I don't know.  I may have been cheated on with two different girls, but I have no proof. 
5.  Have you ever wished you had a physical feature different from your own?   Yes, I wish my skin was clearer and I was less hairy. 
6.  What inborn trait do you see in others that you wish you had for yourself?   Complete confidence.

      Today while I was working out at the CCRB, a girl actually hit on me.  This has happened maybe three times in my entire life.  Here are the details:  The wrestling mats were laid out in the martial arts room because a session of aikido had just concluded.  I had just finished my cardio and lifting and was walking around a bit to cool down.  When I saw the mats, I decided to do some of my wrestling rolls just as a cool down.  I started off walking on my hands because that was the most fun and was the most strenuous.  A girl that was stretching at the end of the room started watching me.  I ignored it, since she was just watching because who walks on their hands?  Thirty seconds later, she came up to me and asked if she could join me.  At this point, I was a bit confused.  I hadn't been hit on in a very long time so I didn't know what to do and I also have a very serious girlfriend.  I didn't want to blow this girl off just for the sake of being rude, but I couldn't lead her on in any way.  Anyway, I said of course she could join me and she asked if I did gymnastics.  I explained that I used to walk on my hands when I wrestled in high school.  She asked if I wrestled for Michigan and I just laughed.  We introduced ourselves and she then said that she does hand stands because she used to do gymnastics in school and that now she likes to breakdance.  She started to show off by walking on her hands and then doing single handed dismounts.  At this point, I either had to commit or bail.  Instead of committing by asking about her dancing, I simply said that I had to get going.  She laughed out of obvious nervousness, probably because she didn't want me to leave.  I simply grabbed my water bottle and headphones and ended that encounter.

      There are enough MP3s on my computer to listen for over a week straight and never hear the same song twice.  Winamp says 183 hours, 14 minutes and 1 second worth of musical goodness is available.  Since it is all on Kazaa, it is  available .

      If you have a second, do a search for my last name in Kazaa.  Over 259 files showed up all because I embedded my name in the ID3 tag of some MP3s I ripped.  These songs were ripped my freshman year of college and then placed on my FTP server.  At the peak, this server got over 100,000 hits in a single weekend.  It's fun to see that my files have spread across the globe.

      When I get older and I own a home, I will have a personal library.  I'm not talking about a den that has a large shelf of books.  I'm talking about a room devoted solely to housing books.  If my (or my wife's) affluence accounts for it, the books will all be bound in the same color and style (not necessarily leather).

      Benadryl =  bad.    I've been taking Claritin for years now, at least since high school.  Just recently, they came out with an over-the-counter form of Claritin.  Now my health insurance doesn't cover perscriptions to Claritin and the OTC version costs $13 for ten doses!  When my prescription to Claritin had run out at school and I needed something to tide me over until I made it to the doctor next, I would just get an off-brand  urlLink antihistamine/decongestant .    When I went to the store to pick some up, they were all out so I decided to try the  urlLink Benadryl version .  Not at good call at all!  Some people take Benadryl just as a sleep aid and now I know why.  I took two in the past few days and my sleep needs have gone up at least 25%.  I even fell asleep in the car when Leah's mom was driving us back to Ann Arbor!  I had to take a nap from noon until 2 PM today even though I got more than my normal amount of sleep last night.  Does anyone need a sleep aid?  I'm not taking anymore of these.

      I am definitely not a big fan of Star Trek, but I've been known to watch quite a bit of The Next Generation and some Deep Space Nine.  Slashdot had an  urlLink article  about Enterprise and how Rick Berman is going to try to salvage it.  The discussion about this article ranged from how Berman needs to be executed to reasoning why the first series were much better.  Out of the blue comes  urlLink this comment .  It is an idea for a new Star Trek show.  The basic premise is of a cadre of special ops members of the Federation that take care of the dirty work.  Read the comment.  If it was shot in a dark, plodding, almost psycho manner, it could be a hit.  If it turns into another wild cowboy show, it could fail.

      Ok, now I have a bit of time to talk about my weekend.  Thursday, I ended up going out with Jamie and Chris.  I really think we have coalesced and get along great as a threesome now.  That is depressing because Chris officially moves to Chicago on Wednesday.  But anyway, we had a good time.  We ended up going to Scorekeepers because of the enticement of $3 pitchers of Coors Light.  We were surprised to find out that before 10 PM, there were $1.50 pitchers of both Coors and Killian's.  Needless to say, we finished off four of them between 9 PM and 10 PM.  Since it was a Thursday, the place was packed like Chinese in the SARS treatment office.  I saw at least four people that I knew, possibly more.  
Friday was the  urlLink Compulsive Lyres  concert.  I hadn't been to an a cappella concert in quite some time, even though I went often in my first few years here.  The Lyres put on a great performance, as did the  urlLink Friars  and the  urlLink Maine Steiners .  Not so great was the Indigo dance team.  After being introduced, they were late getting on stage, couldn't find their places, had to reorganized everything on stage and then the music problems kicked in.  First, there was a boom box on stage that was used as a prop by the Lyres.  For some reason, the dance team thought their music was going to be played on said boom box.  First they couldn't figure out how to turn it on, then they noticed that there was no CD in it.  They looked around confused, got into their dance positions just as their music started  blaring  over the auditorium speakers.  This was just the beginnings of their problems.  Two of the girls just could not stay in sync which threw everyone off.  Though there were many little kids in the audience, most of their music was about sex and filled with swearing.  Needless to say, even though they were scheduled to dance during two portions of the show, they didn't return.  After the show was the Lyres after party at Colonial lanes.  It was a Rock 'N Bowl night, which actually turned out to be quite fun.  Jamie, Alissa, Bri and I bowled a couple of games and none of us broke 100.  Somehow, Jamie found a way to bowl that required her to clench her left butt cheek for balance.  Her butt was sore for days afterward.  We all had fun while bowling, but things got a bit tense early in the morning.  Saturday, Chris and I hung out for most of the day.  His back is pretty messed up, so we went to the doctors first.  The rest of the day was spent playing video games (Tekken 4 and NWN).  That night, Jamie, Zig, Eric, Matt, Kristin and I went to Charlie's and then back to Jamie's place.  Things got a bit crazy at Jamie's since I ended up putting Crisco in Zig's mouth at one point.  I thought it was maybe 1 AM when I finally went to bed but Jamie informed me later that it was closer to 5 AM.  Whoops.  Anyway,  urlLink here  are the pictures from that night.

Even with a cast of (current, past, future) All-Stars like Yzerman, Federov, Shanahan, Robitaille, Hull, Lidstrom, Chelios and Joseph, we got swept in the first round.  It doesn't matter how good you think the Ducks are, the fact is that we were swept.  None of the games were blowouts, but even that fact is inconsequential.    Since we can't rely on the Lions or the Tigers for championships, I guess it's up to the  urlLink Pistons  now!

      Sorry for the lack of posts lately, the end of the semester is hitting hard.  Yesterday, the weather was gorgeous, so Leah and I took a walk through the Arb.  Afterwards I made dinner and subsequently felt extremely tired.  She ran off to a few group meetings and it was time for me to study for the rest of the night.  The combination of the weather, working out, taking a walk and a full meal wore me out, so I decided to make some coffee.  I haven't had large amounts of caffeine since I gave it up at the beginning of this year.  I drank half a pot in about an hour and a half.  
Let's just say that was a horrible idea.  I started to get pretty wired an hour in, but I figured that would be the only symptom.  I was so wrong.  My concentration started to wane, I was getting dizzy and then it got worse.  Eventually, I just wanted to either run around the room or puke.  I had to dry heave for a good five minutes until I could stand up again.  I got probably a good half an hour of work done between midnight and 3:30 AM when I finally fell asleep.

      I do realize that I will be graduating in three days, but I keep forgetting all of the little details that this entails.  Last week, I had my final class and final blue book exam.  This week, I wrote my final paper.  Tomorrow will be my final exam.  This is slightly overwhelming!  
A lot of things are going to be different when I graduate.  There are many little advantages I take for granted, like student pricing on tickets and all of the computing access I get from the university.  I need to figure out what I'm going to do for a primary email address!  I will probably move over to something like mike@bibik.org soon.  But where should I host it?  I don't want to pay for hosting, I am leaving the Daily soon so I can't use their servers and my home server doesn't have a static IP.  Oh well, that might be the least of my worries.  
More later, but for now, it's time for my second-to-last final!

Seems simple enough, especially in a room with a generous amount of ambient noise (read: a server room, or my room since it has two loud computers and a fan already).

      Let's see, where to begin...  First, the interview from a week and a half ago!  I can't divulge much information, for two reasons:  1)  I haven't gotten a yes or a no from said company.  2)  I had to sign an NDA before I could talk to anyone.  Let's see how many details I can give away without giving it all away.  
First, I was told that I would have anywhere between three and five interviews total.  There ended up being a total of six, which I can only interpret as being a hopeful sign.  I arrived at the recruiting building (yes, an entire building devoted to recruiting) around 8 AM and didn't end up leaving until around 6 PM.  Given a half hour for lunch, that was practically nine and a half hours of interviewing!  
Second, the riddles asked were fairly interesting and though I might have heard them all before, I had never solved any of them.  The first one wasn't so much a riddle as a generic design question.  I was asked how I would design the timing on any given traffic light.  I was allowed to request whatever information desired and then I had to come up with some formulas for making the "best" traffic light.  The first part of the problem was how to define "best".  What makes a good traffic light?  I decided it was a combination of two factors:  1)  Maximum throughput in all directions.  2)  Low traffic jam incidence rate.  After figuring out the formula for a single intersection, I had to modify it for a grid of intersections.  Then I was asked to "think outside the box" (yes, that phrase was used exactly) and figure out other ways to improve the experience.  All in all, a basic design problem.  
The second riddle was a programming question, something I didn't expect to encounter since I was interviewing for a management position.  Managers don't code!  I was given a 2D array and had to figure out the time it would take to sort it.  I barely remembered performance numbers for the different sort algorithms, but I remembered that quick sort was O(n log n) (and thankfully was correct).  Sorting a 2D array would thus take (O(n log n))^2.  The second part to the programming question was how to sort two already sorted linked lists.  This was simple, since you just setup two iterators that would move along the two lists, removing the smaller of the two items.  
The riddle I had the hardest time with was the cube desk calendar.  You have two cubes and you are allowed to put any single digit on any face.  With these two cubes, you have to represent every number from 01 to 31.  This turned out to not be that difficult when I realized you could mathematically approach this and define restrictions.  Some examples of these restrictions are that you need a "1" on each block since you have to represent "11".  The same thing for "2" and "22".  Eventually, I got to the point where I had six open spots on the cubes but seven numbers to put on the cubes.  This is when I realized that you could use "6" to represent a "9" and thus solved the puzzle.  
Almost all of the riddle had a mathematic basis.  The next riddle started off as a word problem.  A man starts at point A on a mountain and walks up to point B in exactly 12 hours.  At some time later, he walks down from point B to point A in exactly 12 hours.  He does not have a constant rate of ascent or descent.  The actual riddle was "Can you prove or disprove the existence of a point P where the man took the same amount of time to reach the same spot on the mountain?"  I was having trouble trying to prove this, since it had to be true.  Eventually, I was given a hint to use a graph.  First I tried plotting time versus distance.  That was dumb.  Once I plotted time versus location, I showed that the plots must intersect and thus a point P does exist.  
The last riddle was one I heard a long, long time ago.  I knew the answer, but didn't know how to explain it at first.  This was the "Let's Make a Deal" riddle:  You have three doors to choose from, 1 with a prize and 2 without.  After you choose your door, the host of the show will eliminate one of the doors you did not choose and then ask you to pick again.  You can either stick with your original door or choose the remaining door.  The question is, do you stay or do you switch and why?  I knew you were supposed to switch, but couldn't think off the top of my head why.  Finally I realized that your initial chance at winning was only 1 in 3.  After the elimination, your chance is at least 2 in 3.  Switching is smart.  
Ok, that was the first of more updates.  I gotta run now though.

      Well, it's official.  I've been waiting a long time to post anything of substance because I knew a decision would be coming soon.  I'm now officially a Program Manager at Microsoft on the Critical Response Team in the Mobile Devices Division.  
I will probably be moving out there between the end of June and mid-July.  I'm not sure yet.  There is so much I want to accomplish before moving, so many people to see and say goodbye to, it's overwhelming.  Today, I went car shopping.  I think I found the one I want, but it's a bit pricy for someone who won't be seeing that first pay check for at least two months.  I could wait, but I want it now!  ::whine::

      Well, I chickened out.  I didn't buy  urlLink this , I bought  urlLink this  instead.  Instead of leasing a car for three years, I'm buying it over three years.  I'm also saving myself hundreds of dollars a month in payments and insurance.  I guess I'm happy with this responsible decision.

      Mmm mmm, nothing like a good one month hiatus to get the not-so-creative juices flowing.  Where to start...  
Well, obviously, I started working at Microsoft!  The move out was emotional, if not uneventful.  The flight went fine, I got my month-long rental car just fine and I got into my new (temporary) apartment just fine.  Jenn so gratiously gave me a Gamecube just before I left.  That worked out perfectly because all of my stuff had already been packed to be shipped to the Seattle area so I had to take the GC on the plane.  If it wasn't for the TV and the GC, I probably would have died of boredom those first four days.  Imagine being in apartment without 99% of your belongings in a new city where you don't know anyone.  It was worse than I can describe.  Yeah, I cried off and on those first few days.  There are so many people back in the SE-MI area that I miss!  
Once I got through those first few days, life improved.  I got into a routine of waking up early and going to bed early to prepare myself for work.  I drove around town getting myself used to the area.  One big thing I've noticed is the marked difference in driving patterns.  Five over the speed limit is the most I've seen someone without a radar detector do.  Most people drive slower than the speed limit!  This could be because everyone is used to the traffic...   I swear to god it has to be some of the worst in the US.  The area is surrounded by water and mountains so the highways are not as plentiful as possible.  It's also difficult to widen any of the existing highways.  There are simply too many people and cars for the area.  They do have HOV (carpool) lanes, but it seems that very few people can take advantage of them.  I think I might start carpooling just because no one else is.  Some of the on-ramps are metered (meaning that there is a light that will allow only one car through every few seconds) but allow open access to the HOV lane.  I've also decided to change my car choice because of the traffic.  What's the fun in a  urlLink sports car  if you can't take advantage of it?  It's also possible that I will have a substantial commute, so gas mileage might be a big concern.  I also haven't chosen a city to live in, let alone an apartment.  Lots to do in the next couple of weeks!  
As for the job itself, I'm really not sure how much I can say.  I have a much better understanding of what I will actually be doing though!  From what I can tell, I will be a bug wrangler.  Basically, I will help the developers and testers eliminate bugs from already-released products.  Hotfix, updates, service packs, stuff like that.  Also, my title has changed in the past two weeks: Program Manager on the Critical Response Team in the Mobile Devices Product Group.  They changed from MDD (Mobile Devices Division) to MDPG (Mobile Devices Product Group).  I was told this is a common occurance and not to stock up on business cards since they will be out of date before I get them.  I can't tell anyone my phone number or office number since they are supposed to change in the next two weeks.  The entire group (MDPG) is being shuffled around to better coordinate the smaller groups (like CRT).  
If there is one thing I don't like about the job (yeah, already!) is that there are no set hours.  Basically, if you are in the office in time for meetings and you get all of your work done, you can work whatever hours you want.  Because of this, everyone has the mentality that they need to work 12 hours a day to look productive!  The first day (Monday), I simply told my boss that I was leaving when I had finished all of my day-one work.  He said that was okay.  Today (the second day), I ended up staying for 11 hours.  I got in around 7:30 AM, which is about 2.5 hours before most of the office gets in.  When 4:30 PM rolled around, I didn't think it would look right to leave.  The office was still packed!  I need to go to a car dealership tomorrow around 5 PM and the dealership is 30 minutes away.  I'm going to have to leave before 4:30 PM.  I don't care what it looks like, I'm working hard.  I was given a simple to-do list for the next two days and I've already finished it.  I'm doing well, so far!  
Anyway, that is all I have time for right now.  I still don't have my company-issued laptop and my two computers from home haven't shipped yet, so I have resorted to checking my Umich mail from the local library.  Hopefully this all gets rectified soon.  I miss you all!

      Added pictures from the  urlLink Fourth of July .  I guess I really should add some content other than just pictures...  On the Fourth,  urlLink Lee ,  urlLink Ben ,  urlLink Russ  and I went over to  urlLink Mark's  place for a BBQ.  A few other people stopped by, friends of Mark and Lee's from Umich.  We started cooking the meat before we realized that we didn't have any BBQ tools.  A few of us ran to the store and picked up a set, but that was after we had already melted a plastic spatula trying to remove some hamburgers.    
We cooked and chatted for a few hours, then decided to go to downtown Seattle for fireworks.  Russ and I took his car and Ben and Lee took Lee's car.  Let's just say that it was a case of the blind leading the blind.  Once we found where we were supposed to be, the traffic was unbareable.  It took us at least an hour to find parking, then another 30 minutes to walk to the park.  We met up with some other people just in time for some snacks and then the fireworks started!  The show wasn't terribly eventful; the Livonia fireworks were almost as good.  Afterward, most of the group was going to bars down in Pioneer Square.  Our group dwindled down to Lee, Ben, myself and a guy named Matt.  Neither Matt nor Ben wanted to go to the bar and Lee and myself are fairly laid back, so we succumbed to their will.  Instead of the bars, we went to 7-11 for slurpees then to Krispy Kreme for 18 donuts.  Pretty lame, but it was actually pretty fun.  
That's a bit more than a typical night with the guys, but we are hanging out quite often.  They are a fun bunch, and this is really helping me adjust to the Seattle area.  I will never forget the people back in the Ann Arbor - Livonia area yet I'm glad I've met some people out here.

      Why does Treetop's Berry Juice contain pear juice, apple juice, grape juice and finally raspberry juice?  I mean, I guess it's  not  false advertising since they didn't call it Berries Juice; There is just a single berry.

      I just googled my site for  urlLink Stair Dismount  and I can't believe I never blogged it before!  There is a new version called  urlLink Truck Dismount  which takes the premise of Stair Dismount (define a few variables, launch the dismount and see how much damage the body takes) but instead of stairs uses a moving truck and a few ramps!  I really shouldn't be playing this at work, but it's terribly addictive.  It has a good mix of complexity and ease of entry.  The complexity is a time sink because you keep tweaking things trying to create bigger crashes and more damaging launches.

      Jeff and I have started an actual honest-to-goodness workout routine.  We are shooting to work out at least 5 times a week (more depending on work load and possible visitors) and we are going to track our progress.  Currently, we take a notebook with us to record the exercises, weight and reps.  When I get back to work the next day, I update an Excel spreadsheet with the data.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the information, but never fear.  I'm a huge dork; I'm bound to make charts and graphs representing our progress.  
Since we also play racquetball every day, we sometimes don't get enough time to do as many exercises as desired.  Yesterday we were able to get through bench press, leg press, rope tricep pushdown, lateral pulldown, left and right obliques, hamstrings, and abdominals.

      My car has barely 2,300 miles on it and I already have to make an insurance claim.  I was driving on 520 from my apartment to the good Target in Redmond.  I'm following behind a Red Ford Expedition at a decent distance.  Out of nowhere, I see that he is about to run over a 4'x4' piece of plywood.  The SUV drives directly over it so that it goes between his wheels.  The downforce air pressure from the SUV causes the wood to fly up into the air.    
It flips slowly and at just the right angle so that when I PLOW into it, it is like hitting a wall.  Most of the board shatters into hundreds of car-scratching pieces but one 1.5'x1.5' chunk sticks to my bumper since I'm driving 60 MPH.  I pull off to the shoulder, slow down, the piece slides down and I run it over (possibly causing unseen tire damage).  
I just called the insurance agent and thankfully it will be covered.  Unfortunately, the adjuster is booked until next Saturday and I will have to pay my $250 comprensible deductible.  Oh well, I'm not that upset.  If I had bought a sports car, I would have been a bit peeved.

      So, the trip to New York City…   my first time, actually.  I’ve been to a few large metropolises before:  Detroit, San Francisco, Atlanta, Boston, Seattle, Orlando and Toronto to name them all.  NYC is completely different from all of them and it starts with the ambiance.    
Starting out in Times Square had to affect my perception dramatically, though.  The overall feeling that spewed from the city wasn’t the common perception of impatience, snobbery or discourteousness, but one of surging energy.  As Leah said, there is just so much to the city given that there are so many different sectors, each with its own life force.   Time Square was bursting with this power because of the sheer vivacity (tactless extravagance) and curiosity (aimless tourists).    
We also visited the rest of midtown, much of the upper East and West sides, downtown and even touched some of the NYU campus.  Blast to the fact that I didn’t have my camera that night:  there is a cube almost identical to the one on the UMich campus!  The only difference is that theirs didn’t spin.  As Leah and I noticed it and walked near, someone hopped out of the car at a red light.  He scampered over the cube and tried to give it a push.  He hopped back into his car and then gestured to his passenger that he knew of a cube that rotated.  I yelled to him “The one in Ann Arbor spins, eh?” and he looked back, slightly bewildered and replied in the affirmative.  
Since Leah had just turned twenty one the previous week, we hit a few bars during the trip.  She had received a few suggestions from coworkers and with the power of Pocket Streets on my Pocket PC, we hunted them down.  First problem:  one of the bars was called Bowery.  When I pulled a “Find Place…”, it found Bowery alright.  It wasn’t until we were in the heart of Chinatown with no one around that I realized that it found a street called Bowery and had simply shown me the centermost location on that street.  We used the Pocket PC to locate the nearest bar she had been recommended, headed in that direction, but ended up going to the closest bar we saw.  It was called Pioneer and wasn’t too bad of a place.    
It was only 11:30 PM and while the bars in Ann Arbor or Seattle would be full at that time, NYC bars are open until 4 AM and don’t seem to swell until 1:30 AM.  There were about 25-35 people inside total, but you couldn’t tell by the noise level.  The DJ was blaring a mix of old and new dance (pop mostly) though no one was dancing and everyone had to yell over the music to hear each other.  Nonetheless, we had fun.  A few (expensive) drinks later, our tongues were looser and we both learned something.  Though I paid $7 for a shot, that wasn’t anywhere near as bad as $26 for a Woo Woo (vodka, peach schnapps and cranberry juice) and a Cosmopolitan when we saw Cabaret!  
Cabaret was the first show we saw, but it did pale in comparison to Long Day’s Journey into the Night.  Jon Secada as the MC?  He can sing, but he cannot dance or act.  The actress that played Sally (Melinda Karakaredes (sp?)) did more than an admirable job.  I had seen the 1972 version of Cabaret with Liza Minelli, but I do believe that I fell asleep through part of it.  I could follow the story well since I had seen the movie, even if I couldn’t understand some of the lyrics of some of the songs.  
Long Day’s Journey into the Night was our first idea for the trip.  It was closing weekend, Leah had heard nothing but good reviews and it had Brian Dennehey *and* Philip Seymour Hoffman!  Even though those seem like bigger names to me, it was Vanessa Redgrave that stole the show.  She had a much more difficult role to play and she absolutely sold it.  It was a character piece, and thus I was a huge fan.  Hoffman’s role seemed small and insignificant at first, but then the final scene changed all of that.  Read the book or watch the movie to see what I mean.  
The three museums we hit (Met, Whitney and Guggenheim) simply reinforced my ideas about art.  If it does not show technical ability or is not visually appealing (very subjective), then it’s worthless.  I still dislike watercolors and most modern art, still like primary colors, pale orange and brown against white and silver, Mondrian and Rotko, Meiji period Japanese art, geometric abstraction and period fusion (example:  an series of WWII-style Japanese bombers in the shape of an infinity symbol over a burning current-day mid Manhattan done in the style of Edo period Japanese room screens using mother-of-pearl inlay and gold).  I probably spent more time in museums in the past four days than I have in the past 10 years combined.  No complaints.  
Well, that’s it.  Pictures to come.

      The site seems to be operating at 100% efficiency again!  I'm not exactly sure what caused the slowdown, but my suggestion to my website admin is what caused the latest problems (eg  urlLink gallery  was broken)!  I noticed that the log files for apache were reaching sizes larger than 1.3  GB , so I suggested rotating the logs.  When apache was restarted, it was mistakenly restarted in chroot mode (a security feature that we don't really need) and that broke just about everything.  My  urlLink home dir website  was down,  urlLink gallery  was down, etc.  Another quick email and things are back up again!

      Damn you, AT&T Wireless.  So the new Smartphone is finally coming to market and it is being heavily marketed.  AWS is going to have a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal on launch day and everything.  The new phone is being sold for under $300, which is actually a great price point for the hardware and services being offered.  The device is being sold internally to Microsoft at a 45% discount, which is also amazing.  
The problem is that AWS plans are so expensive!  Internally, the two plans being offered are $76/month and $95/month for 700 and 1,100 voice minutes respectively and 30 MB of data.  That is just WAY too much.  I thought spending $50 on my Sprint phone was overkill.  For unlimited data and 1,100 voice minutes, the price jumps to $109!  Come on.  Also, get this, those are the Microsoft discount rates!  For 1,100 minutes, it is normally $120 without data!  I feel like screaming.  
No cellular service is worth that much.

      Ugh and double ugh.  My current project at work has proved next to impossible and the deadline is being to peek over the horizon.  Basically, I need to categorize various bug fixes.  The difficult portion of this project is that I'm given the updated source code for each bug fix but the report needs to know the final location in our image of these fixes.  From what I've seen, there is no way to trace a source file to the eventual binary file in the image.  
I thought I had a good idea to build the image, apply the changes, rebuild and see which files changed.   I did that to a very small bug fix and 10% of the files changed (~1000)!  I figured that had to be wrong so I compiled the full image, made no changes then compiled again.  I saw that roughly 10% of the files had changed again.  This is going to be tough to figure out.

 It complements the flavors of so many foods.  I'm not going to start drinking it with pizza and burgers but it works with most everything else.
 Maybe it's just my lack of wine drinking experience, but that stuff hits me hard!  Two glasses of wine has the same potency as six beers to me.

From the screenshots that were released early on in the development cycle, I wasn't too excited.  Now,  urlLink gameplay videos  are available and they have definitely changed my tune.  It's like they took all of the good aspects of the original game and improved upon them.  Bullet time looks cool and useful, unlike in the first game where it was a necessary evil.  Another thing I just noticed is that the object physics seem to be even better than the UT2K3 engine!

 3x optical zoom

My suggestion turned out to be for the  urlLink Canon PowerShot S400 .  After looking around for cameras, I realized that the S400 is smaller and has better resolution than my S30 and costs the same price new.  Silly technology improvements.  
While whale watching, I encountered the only problem I have with my camera:  weak optical zoom.  Considering that the optical zoom on my S30 is only 3x and very few consumer-level digital cameras offer anything greater, I think I will have to stick with it for now.

I  urlLink had a subscription  and I'm now glad that I cancelled it.  The new plan is $9.99/month for 40 downloads or $14.95/month for 65 downloads.  Given that Emusic.com mostly carries indie, most of my downloads were hit-or-miss.  I'd try something out just because they suggested it and sometimes it was great but more often it was deleted.  Now that the downloads are so restricted, usage patterns are going to be changed drastically as well.

      Alright  urlLink Lindsay , let's see if I can match your dream posts.  
The first dream I had was more of a nightmare.  Basically, two shady guys were going door to door trying to sell Smartphones to people.  They had about 40 of the phones just tossed into a big plastic box.  I don't remember actually letting them into the house, but all of a sudden they were both in my parents kitchen trying to sell us AR11s.  As a side note, the  urlLink AR11  is our most hated device.  It would never see a retail market because it has so many problems.  
 Anyway, at first they were lackadaisically trying to get us to each buy a phone.  It seemed that they were both very tired, worn out and just wanted money.  It also seemed as if all the phones were stolen, obviously.  When we refused to buy a phone, they started to argue and yell at us.  Eventually, I took things into my own hands and started to beat on the leader of the two guys.  I didn't hurt him too much and suddenly he was gone.  I shoved his companion out the door and he rested against a parked car.     
Now this is where it starts to get weird and will be hard to imagine.  So picture that you are looking out the door of a house onto a driveway.  From your vantage point, you can see just the backend of a car parked in the driveway.  The second bad guy that I tossed out of the house was leaning against the car, facing the door.  He wasn't looking directly at me, but basically looking at the ground.  He seemed exhausted and looked to be resting a bit before moving on.   Suddenly and without warning, you see just a glimpse of the first shady guy come into the picture as he drops an axe down on the skull of the second guy, practically cleaving it in two!  For some reason, I busted out of the house and ran past both the man wielding the axe and his now-dead accomplice.  I felt that I was being chased a bit and then I felt everything had changed.  I looked around, and the man with the axe was now laying on his back on the hood of a different car.  His axe seemed to have bashed him directly in the face.   I focused past that and saw my mom's friend Evelyn holding a smoking gun!  I can only assume that while he was chasing me, she shot him in the back, he fell back onto the car and then his axe fell onto his face.  I woke up after that one.  
The second dream is fairly hazy, but I know some details.  The scene was the last day of class in presumably high school.  It was more like a boarding school because not only did we have to clean out our desks and say goodbye to students and teachers but we had to pack up our bedding and clothes as well.  I'm sure this has something to do with me reading so much Harry Potter lately.  I know there was some crying and there was a dark haired female teacher that we were all sad to say goodbye to.  The next thing I know, I'm getting married!  I don't remember much of the details, but it seems that in the dream I had a wedding and got married to Jamie, then we divorced, then I was getting married to someone else not a month later.  Weird.

Burns is on a downward slope.  If his performance in Italy is any indication of his desire to win the championship, we can all but write him off.  Expect Burns to score maybe 8 more points over the last three rallies.  Loeb is hot now, but he is also inexperienced.  His car is sick, so if he can avoid a major retirement in Britain he is going to pull down at least 15 more points.  Sainz is too experienced to drop out of this championship without a fight.  He won't partake in any major gambling, but he will be consistant.  I'll give him 12 points.  Petter knows he needs to score some serious points to vault into the championship, so he will twist his natural talent into desperation.  At least two early retirements will keep him below 8 more points in the final rallies.  Markko is going to destroy the next two rallies.  Expect a first and a second place finish.  The final rally in Great Britain is going to decide this championship.  Gronholm has retired from the last three rallies.  Expect another two retirements with a third place race to finish off the season.  The final standings and points:

      Deciding to change my own oil may have been a bad call and I haven't even done it yet!  After calling around to four different oil change shops in the area, I decided to do it myself.  The cheapest I found was $25 and that was at a place I wouldn't trust.  I ran to Napa auto parts and purchased six quarts of Mobil 1, oil filter, filter wrench, funnel, shop rags and wheel ramps.  $70 in initial costs and an estimate of about $31 per additional oil change means I'm going to spend more money to do it myself!  Granted, the prices that I was quoted for an oil change was not for synthetic oil.  I guess it is more respectable to change your own oil...   nah, I screwed up.

      Car update:  So, you all know about the damage to my car ( urlLink original condition ,  urlLink information ,  urlLink damaged condition ).  For some reason when I signed up for auto insurance, I didn't elect to add rental car coverage.  My thought was simply that I doubt I will ever need to make a claim and if so it would only be for a couple of days.  I figured that if I needed to rent a car, paying for two days wouldn't be so bad.  Sigh, such stupidity.  
I took my car in two Mondays ago (09/22/2003) and expected to have it back by Wednesday.  When I dropped it off, they said it would be done by Friday at the latest.  Oh well, what can I do, I need a car so I will just pay for 5 days.  Friday rolls around and the car is not ready.  That sucks because the shop is closed on the weekends meaning at least three more days of renting the car.   Monday comes and the car is not ready.  Tuesday comes and the car is not ready.  Finally I pick up the car on Wednesday (10/01/2003) and they got the wrong fog lamp in so that wasn't replaced.  Total charge for renting a car for ten days:  $375!  All because I didn't want to pay the $60/year for car rental coverage.

      Endurance races in Gran Turismo 3 are a bitch!  The easiest one, im my opinion, is the Roadster race.  All of the cars are stock roadsters, so it's fairly easy to get a useable car from the start.  I used a Mazda LS with super-slick (AKA high-endurance) tires.  It took over 70 minutes to complete 40 laps, but I demolished the competition!  I lapped everyone and almost double lapped the slowest car.  There are four possible cars you can receive after winning this race (F688/S F1, Mazda Miata, Mazda Miata 1.8 RS or Mazda Miata RS) and of course I got the worst one (the plain Miata).  Sigh.

      Another night, another crazy dream though I can only rememeber a few details from this one.  Basically, I was a spy and my boss was the developer lead for my team.  My first task was to assemble a disguise that would let me infiltrate the ranks of my target.  It required some sort of black cape, weird black boots, a wig and makeup to look like an old woman and four old, silver coins.  I started to assemble this disguise and eventually realized it would not work and came up with a different one.  I had on tight black pants, black dress shoes, a beige collared sweater (sort of like this  urlLink one  but with a collar) with the collar up.  
Now that I had my disguise (if you can even consider that a disguise), I had to infiltrate the target location.  From my surroundings, the locale was possibly the city of New York, but checking my maps showed St. Petersburg.  So, yes, I was infiltrating a Russian installation.  From here, the rest of the dream is very fuzzy.  I do remember getting onto an elevator and having a woman roll her eyes viciously.  
I do remember some of the emotions that I felt.  When I was performing the first task, I knew that I was taking shortcuts and that my boss would be upset if he found out.  I believe the same thing happened when I was actually on my way to the base.  I was using some sort of device to track my location (probably a  urlLink Windows Mobile  powered device, naturally) and that was against the rules of engagement.

      So in the past two weeks of flag football, my team has lost 58-0 and 28-2.  Last week, my QB didn't remember how to hand off the ball and I plowed into him.  The starting QB and the starting RB, plowing directly into each other.  Too bad I was the taller of the two as my nose connected to his forehead.   The blood started flowing immediately.  This week, I jammed my middle finger on my right hand before the game started.   That wouldn't have been that bad but I was starting QB!  I couldn't feather out my floating passes like I wanted to and the team can't catch bullet passes.   I gave up five interceptions, I believe.

      About a week ago, I sent out an email to just about everyone in my address book that didn't live in Washington.  The email outlined my new contact info for both home and work and that's about it.  Well, some people didn't seem to appreciate this information:

 
From lwashnoc@yahoo.com 
Date: Mon, 6 Oct 2003 18:04:05 -0700 (PDT) 
From: Laura Washnock-DiPietro   
To: mbibik AT umich DOT edu  

Mike,  
 
I want you to stay completely out of my life, that is, after all, why I 
broke up with you.  This means that I do not want to hear from you and I 
do not want you contacting, in any way, my friends and family.  Trust me, 
they do not want to hear from you either.  I did not email you earlier 
because I did not want to talk to you.  I don't care about your new 
address and phone number.  I don't care about your new job.  In short, I 
don't care about what you are doing with your life.  I also do not care 
for you to know what is going on in my life.  
 
If you are looking for closure, here it is.  I broke up with you because 
you made me miserable.  You were emotionally abusive and controlling.  
You put me down and made me feel stupid for being myself.  When I broke 
up with you, I was too afraid of you to be this direct.  I am not anymore 
and I am sick of you trying to weasel your way back into my life.  Leave 
my friends alone.  Leave my family alone.  Leave me alone.  
 
Laura 
 

Seeing as how a regular reply might not be appreciated either and I always need to get the last word in, here is my open letter of reply:

 
Laura,  

First off, relax.  We have not talked since the beginning of this  
year.  I sent two emails over that period of time inquiring about your  
well-being.  I love how that is considered me trying to weasel my way  
back into your life!  I send an email to everyone in my address book about  
my new contact info and this is the reply that I get?  That is just a bit  
dramatic!  

Twice you mentioned leaving your family and friends alone.  I can only  
assume that you brought this up because they received the same contact  
info email as you did.  Had I known that would upset them so much, I  
definitely would have reconsidered sending it to them!  Sarcasm aside, I  
will not trust you when you say they don't want to hear from me.  A few of  
your friends didn't like me while we were together and I'm sure a few more  
switched sides when you broke up with me.  I do know that certain people,  
including at least one sibling of yours, think differently.  You may have  
requested that they all shun me but that cannot affect their true  
feelings.  Who is being the controlling one now?  It's a shame that you  
cannot trust them to make their own decisions.  

I made you feel stupid?  I'm sorry; I must have acted as a mirror of some  
sort, allowing you to see yourself for who you truly are.  It does not take  
much for someone whose only intellectual hobby is to watch VH1 for hours  
on end to think of themselves as being stupid.  Try reading a book.   
Better yet, try challenging yourself!  Outside of your required courses,  
did you take anything difficult in college?  I know you didn't make it  
into the honors program, but there are some difficult classes offered to  
the rest of the school as well.  

So, you broke up with me so that I would stay completely out of your life?   
Is that how it works?  Why is it that so many other people have the ability  
to break up and at least be cordial?  Actually, if I remember correctly,  
you have no contact whatsoever with any of your exes.  Why is that?  Do you  
understand how to forgive people?  Are your emotional abilities so  
black-and-white that once you break up with someone, all emotion toward  
them must turn to hate?  Do you even understand how to separate the  
concepts of friend and significant other?  Hopefully you will learn with  
Alex.  Hey, he was one of my good friends back in elementary school.  He was  
probably one of the main reasons why we broke up and still I do not hate  
him.  Forgive and forget.  

Here is my take on the situation as a whole.  You met Alex while we were  
together and while our relationship was having problems.  Having a small  
shred of morality, you knew that you couldn't cheat so you decided to  
break up with me to be with him.  Though we did have problems, there was  
still some good in the relationship.  While you were with Alex, you had to  
channel that emotional energy somewhere.  The easiest emotion to channel  
into is hate, so there it went!  It is much easier to hate someone with  
support from people you are close to so you slandered me enough to gain  
this support.  When you saw my latest email, you felt a slight twinge of  
interest but you had to kill it.  Instead of forgiving and forgetting, you  
redirected that twinge into the anger spewed forth in your email.  For that  
emotional outburst, I applaud you.  

Even if I am completely wrong, know that you have now proved yourself as  
the paragon of emotional puerility you were destined to become.  

M.

      My apartment complex is comprised of four seperate buildings that share a single underground parking garage.  When Russell and I moved in, we took two of the last parking spots available.  They were over by building B while we lived in building A but it is just a short 30 meter walk across the garage.  Last night after working out, I followed another car into the garage.  They parked over by building A while I parked by building B.  We crossed paths as we went to the opposing building.  I didn't think anything of it, but she called out to me just as I was about to enter the building.  We traded contact info and decided that we should trade parking spots.  She was quite attractive as well; maybe that is why I didn't say anything in the first place.

      As of today,  urlLink Windows Mobile  powered  urlLink Smartphones  are available in the US!   urlLink AT&T Wireless  is carrying the  urlLink Motorola MPx200 .  This is a monumental leap forward for my department.  We have been working on the Smartphone platform for years and we are now in the US market!  The AT&T site is selling the phone for $299, but until 10/28/2003,  urlLink Amazon  has the  urlLink phone for $149.99  (after $150 mail-in rebate).  
It is difficult to explain just how powerful these phones are in words.  First off, it's a great phone.  Reception is rarely an issue, audio quality is fantastic and all the features of a regular phone are there.  Combine that with a full-fledged PIM (calendar, contacts, tasks, email), MP3 and video player, Internet Explorer, MSN Messenger, and more!  An additional feature that not many people know about is you can use most of these phones as a wireless modem as well!  Anywhere you go with your laptop, just connect your phone with the provided USB cable and now you are on the internet!  
The longer I am in this department, the more I love the products.

      So last night was the  urlLink big go-karting event  at  urlLink Champs Karting .  Racers:  Katherine, Russ, Jeff, Jeff's sister, Jeff's sister's boyfriend, Lee, Mark, Andy, Kevin, Joel, Dennis, Rob and another Jeff.  It's a shame that Champs online results system is broken because then I could give actual speed numbers.  At Champs, each race is 18 laps and because of the staggered start, the winner is whomever has the fastest single lap.  I raced with Katherine, Mark and Lee.  Mark set the fastest lap of the night (for our group) with a 20.00 flat.  Lee was second with a very close 20.03 and I was third with 20.30.  
The track was fairly small but I didn't fully figure it out until about half way through.  As you can see on  urlLink this map , there are a few hairpin turns.  The worst was turn 3.  No matter what I did, I couldn't seem to get enough exit velocity.  If it was a real car, I would have changed the gear ratios for faster low-end acceleration.  I figured out how to gain some serious velocity through turns 1 and 2, but 3 was my down fall.  I'm sure another go at it and I would improve by at least .3 seconds a lap.  
Overall, I think everyone had a good time.  Jeff and crew had to leave early since they had just gotten in from across the country that morning.  His sister honestly looked like she pulled two all nighters.  You know that glazed, watery look?  She had a textbook case.  Jeff will probably drag me back there, no worries.  
Afterward, Katherine, Russ, Lee and I went to Belltown Billiards.  We were supposed to meet up with Lee's friend Craig, but he never showed.  Everytime I go to the bar, I can never think of a cool mixed drink to order.  I need to work on a list.

      So, Katherine works in pharmaceutical sales.  One of the greatest accomplishments in this field is to get one of your drugs into regular rotation at a hospital.  Basically, once the drug has been accepted by the hospital, smaller practices near the hospital will pick it up.  Once it's spread through one area, other hospitals may pick it up soon after.  Getting a hospital to accept your drug is no easy process.  A representative doctor will get drilled about all the details on a drug for hours on end in front of a huge committee.  Kat's father is a cardiologist.  By basically his idea, his impetus and his work, he got one of her drugs approved at the local hospital.  The hospital was not in her territory, so she knew that some of the credit would naturally fall to the territory owner.    Last night after a hard day of work, she got home and checked her email.  Her boss sent out an email to the entire west coast staff including her great great grandmanager.  The announcement basically gave 110% of the credit to this other person and practically put Kat down!  The wording of the email stated that this other person did all of the work, Kat basically helped the morning of the final presentation (implicating that she was late with the work and lazy) and gave very little credit to her father.  Naturally, she was appalled.  It's going to be hard to repair all of the damage that single email has done.  I suggested it was time to start becoming a backstabbing, credit-grabbing bastard like the rest of her coworkers.

I wasn't exactly sure if it was the lack of caffeine or the dramatic increase in exercise that was the cause of the change.  Now that I'm still working out just as much (or more) and I'm back on caffeine, my sleep requirements are back at 8.5 hours.

      So I'm back to including a bit of cardio into my exercise regime.  On Tuesday, Jeff decided he wasn't up for racquetball so we did 30 minutes of cardio before lifting.  I hit the elliptical for that entire time, burning over 400 calories.  Lifting directly afterward felt so much different than normal where we start with lifting.  Basically, every exercise seemed at least 15% more difficult.  Anytime I have to grunt through an entire set of bench presses, I shouldn't be doing that much weight (nor does anyone actually want to hear me grunt).  Last night, Jeff had two futbol games to play with his MS club so I hit the gym alone.  Again, 400 calories on the elliptical.  
Many people have commented on my increased size (I've assumed musculature so far since most of these people wouldn't say "Man, looking a little pudgy there, Mike!"), but I feel that all the added muscle mass is simply pushing the existing fat out farther.  I'm almost tempted to scale back lifting in favor of cardio, but then I wouldn't be making progress in strength.  I've added at least 25 pounds to my bench since we started working out at the end of the summer.  Maybe I should just get liposuction and keep lifting!

       urlLink FCC allows home numbers to be switched to wireless phones - Nov. 11, 2003 :  When I first read this article, I thought "Great!  So many people will love this feature."  Now that I really think about it, how much use is this really going to get?  Ever since cell phones became popular, adding a new phone number became a routine occurance.  It is not that big of a deal to change a phone number.  I could have a skewed viewpoint because almost everyone that has my phone number also has an email address.  Everytime I changed phone numbers (which happened every year in college and once again when I moved out to Washington), I've sent out an email announcing the change.  It could be much more difficult for other people that do not have an alternate form of communication.
  
 I can see this being used by people that ran a business line in their home.  They can keep the same number, which is probably on business cards, websites, etc but now have it tied to a mobile phone.  Since I work in the mobile phone industry, any way to get more people to switch is fine with me!  
I do see one issue with this ruling though.  Up to this point, I believe that telemarketers relied on the fact that cell phones and landlines were completely seperate.  They knew which extensions mobile operators had and would not call those numbers (since it is illegal to telemarket to a cell phone since it costs the customer money).  Now, that line is completely removed.  Is there going to be a national database of cellular versus landlines?  How secure would that be?

      Animals, animals and more animals.     Russell's older brother is currently studying to be a veterinarian.  Before we moved in together, Russ mentioned that he might want to get a dog eventually.  Back then, I stated that I wouldn't have any problem with that whatsoever as long as he was the one to take care of the dog.  I wouldn't mind having to ocassionally fill a food dish or take the pup out for a walk, but that would be about it.  The topic was dropped then, but Russ' brother recently had to spay/neuter a puppy for his studies.  Usually, these dogs are mutts from the Humane Society, but this one turned out to be a purebred doberman pinscher.  
Since this dog was just so darned cute, Russ had to bring up the idea of getting a dog since his brother could give it away to anyone.  I said the same thing as before but pointed out that this dog wasn't going to be small for very long.  Also, he would probably destroy something if he was kept in the apartment by himself for 10+ hours a day.  We agreed, no puppy for us.  
Kat and her parents have a total of three cats.  Two of them, Charlotte and Emily (the "Bronte Sisters") have been with the family for quite a few years now.  They are a mix between what seems to be to be a Russian Blue or Chartreux and an orange English Shorthair.  The third cat is Sebastian, a brown tabby, and is only 6 months old.  Emily is fairly social, so it wasn't much of a surprise when she felt comfortable enough to come up to me.  The other two are a different story.  Sebastian is still in the playful kitty phase, but Kat told me that I'm the only person other than herself that he has cuddled with. As for Charlotte, she isn't terribly social so Kat is also surprised when she always comes up to me for affection.  I think Kat is just jealous!

I needed to dispose of a few plastic containers that I used to move in and our apartment complex only offers a chute for trash bags.  These plastic totes barely fit into my hatchback, so they sure as heck were not going to fit down that chute.  
Thankfully, there is a large string of medical centers about a block from here because of the hospital being so close.  Friday night at 5 PM, the day after a holiday, few people are going to be in the office.  I found a dumpster and it found my totes.

       urlLink Ford to drop SVT Focus, put entire SVT lineup on hiatus :  No more SVT Focus!  That is a shame because just about every review I've read of the car said it was outstanding.  I really shouldn't think about the SVT too much because I want to kick myself for getting the ZX3 instead.  The retail price on my ZX3 was MORE than a well-equipped SVT and the SVT is a better vehicle in almost all regards (other than noise and softness of ride).  170 HP, almost as fast as a 911 Carrera in the slalom, okay gotta stop thinking about it.  If only I was more comfortable with a manual, I would have bought it back in July...  
Anyway, back to the article.  The ST model that is mentioned is probably similar to the UK-spec ST170:  basically the same engine as the SVT (170 HP) but without the rest of the upgrades (suspension, tires, brakes, interior, transmission, etc).

      Weekend update:  

On Sunday, I finally made it to a donation center.  When I first moved out to Washington, I brought all of my college apartment furniture, electronics and applicances.  I figured that I would have enough startup costs with moving into a new apartment and buying a car that I could use my old college crap for awhile to get me by.  I dropped quite a bit on the down payment for the car and had to buy a few essentials for the apartment (sofa, bed, desk, dresser, bookshelves, everything for the bathroom, etc) so I was glad I brought everything else.  I've slowly replaced a few items and instead of getting rid of them immediately, I just tossed them into the corner of the room!  Basically, we had an extra TV, VCR and TV stand in our living room for the past three months.  Kat showed me the local Goodwill donation center Sunday morning so I packed up the ol' Focus hatchback and finally made a donation.  
I got rid of said TV, VCR and TV stand along with two huge garbage bags of clothes (cleaned and folded, thank you), microwave, toaster, coffee pot and some other assorted items.  They didn't take the TV, so I just tossed it into the garbage/recycle room in my complex.  If it's still there after trash day, I will probably take it to a real recycle center since Jeff informed me that the tube contains toxic materials.  

After getting rid of so much stuff, I decided I need to fill those now-empty spaces with new stuff.  I picked up a duvet cover and blanket (both in dark blue) and then Jeff and I went out shopping.  On the way to Ikea, we decided to check out Fry's.  It can only be described as a combination of the best parts of Best Buy and Radio Shack in a Wal-Mart sized setting.  Automatic geekgasm.  At Ikea, I picked up a  urlLink frame  for my  urlLink Hokusai Katsushika  print.  It's not terribly Japanese, I know, but I simply like it for aesthetic reasons.  Jeff had to continually remind me that I am heterosexual so that I wouldn't  urlLink buy   urlLink certain   urlLink prints .  But come on, with a blue and white theme in my bedroom,  urlLink this  would complement it well!  

On Saturday, Jeff, Russ, his two visitors, Rebecca and Rob, and I went to  urlLink Rocksport  in West Seattle to see  urlLink Michigan defeat Ohio State .  I was about to say "upset Ohio State", but we all knew who was going to win!  Rocksport was an interesting place to see the game.  All but a handful of people were there specifically to cheer on the Wovlerines as the Seattle alumni association goes there for every game.  They served (a fairly crappy) breakfast, but service was surprisingly good for a bar at 9 AM.  After the game, Jeff and I hit Kenneth Cole ( urlLink shoes  in brown/tan,  urlLink shirt ,  urlLink shirt  in black).  After a quick lunch, we hit the gym.  That night, Kat and I went to Cutters for dinner (not terribly impressed) and then had a quiet night at home.

      Well I dragged Kat out to Greek food (Orexi) last night.  I think that was our last time!  Basically all of the food was overcooked.  She normally likes spanokopeta but not when it's that well-done!  My dolemades were fine but she didn't like those either.

      Yesterday, I was talking to the person on my team that is setting up our holiday party.  We were talking about trying to get a small group of the younger members of the team together for the division-wide holiday party.  I told her that the menu seemed fairly extravagant, so I was definitely going.  She hadn't seen that email and she couldn't find it in her inbox, so she asked me who sent it so she could search for it.  Oddly enough, the first thing that came to mind was "Merlot reduction", since I believe one of the meat dishes featured that.  Her quote "Have you ever heard of the word...   what is it...   metrosexual?"  
Everyone thinks of me when they hear that word and now people think of the word when they think of me.  When I told Russ this story, he said he thinks of me every time he hears that word.

      Ok, about AX:  This Saturday, I decided that since flag football season was over and Katherine was getting ready to go to Dallas on a business trip, I might as well get started on my holiday shopping.  I spent quite a few hours at  urlLink Bellevue Square  and hit at least 20 stores.  One of the last stores I went to, mostly out of curiosity, was Armani Exchange.  Personally, I hate their clothing.  It's either label-saturated or a misguided attempt at being trendy.  While I was there, I had not one, not two, not three, but four different sales people try to help me.  Normally I walk into a store like that and I'm lucky to get any help.  The last sales person, male, got my attention by staring directly into my eyes for a second.  I turned away, then noticed he was still watching me.  I made eye contact again and he started up conversation.  Most of it was "how is shopping going", "who are you buying for" and basic salesperson chat.  When he said "What are you doing afterward?", that was when I figured out I was being hit on.  My response "Probably just some more shopping." with a condescending smirk ended that discussion.

      Once again, learning something not from Slashdot, but because of links found there.  Starting with  urlLink this discussion about a nuclear-powered mission to the moons of Jupiter , there was a link to this  urlLink article , stating that crash landing a nuclear-powered probe into Jupiter could cause it to turn into a star.  Basically, this article is full of facts and a gross misuse of these facts.  They have correct information about the Galileo craft and some fairly factual discussion about fission, fusion and bombs.  While it is true that the materials on the craft could be used for a fission bomb, they completely ignored the concept of critical mass.  I couldn't think of the right term while reading the incorrect article, but the question of just how much plutonium was necessary came to mind.  
Bad Astronomy saves the day and debunks the possiblity of a small nuclear-powered probe turning Jupiter into a star with this  urlLink article .  The critical (pun intended) points here are:
 
 The plutonium onboard Galileo was kept in small pellets, none of which were near critical mass.
 The hydrogen on Jupiter is of the most abundant isotope and lacks deuterium and tritium needed for a fusion reaction.
 Jupiter is about 1/80th the size needed to be a self-sustaining star.
 
I love science.

      I just had a pretty crazy dream.   I don't remember all the details, but I know it involved trying to go to a play, or a conference or something.  To me, it seemed like we were in East Lansing, or some other college town that I've visited but didn't know too well.  The overall theme of the dream seemed to concern men versus women, and more specifically, women standing up to men treating them poorly.  Some of the people that were in my dream:  Jenn, Laura, Angie, Steve Jackson from the Daily and some girl that I just barely remember being a friend of Rob and Gareth.  
I don't really remember the play/conference/whatever, but I know that we went out to eat afterwards.  The place was called BD's, but instead of it being like BD's Mongolian BBQ, it was more like Dixie's BBQ and was fast food.  The restaurant was so darkly lit that I couldn't even read the menu and was about to just order a "Number 1 Combo" just to be safe when an altercation occured.  Some guy brushed up too close to the girl that I just barely remember and so she yelled at him and shoved him.  A couple of other guys were just loitering around that area and started to make fun of her.  That's when I stepped in, put one of the guys in an arm lock and said "Do you like having the use of this arm?"  He was quiet after that.

      Weekend update:  
Friday turned out a bit differently than I originally expected. I knew that Kat was leaving for a business trip on Sunday morning and that she would be pretty busy getting ready on Saturday night, so I planned on seeing her.  Around 7:30 PM, Mark called and said that he was going out to some bars downtown with Dan and some friends.  I figured that Kat, Jeff, Russ and I hadn't been out drinking in awhile so I thought we could all get together.  Well, all the stress of trying to close on a new townhome, stress of work and stress of trying to get ready for a week-long business trip caught up to Kat.  She decided that I should just go out with the guys and have fun.  No way!  If this was probably the last night I would get to see her for a week, of course I was going to try to see her.  I basically had to convince her to let me come over and that I would go out with the guys afterward.  We had a fairly quiet night at her place and I tried my damnest to wash away some of her stress.  By the time I got back to my apartment, Russ was sound asleep and Mark never called me to say where he would be downtown.  That ended that night.  

Saturday was a bit more productive.  I figured that I wouldn't be able to see Kat at all, so I was going to tackle some Christmas shopping.  Before I got started with that, Jeff and I grabbed lunch at King and I, a Thai restaurant near his apartment.  Not too bad, but their take on "3 star" spicy was definitely including White Man Penalty and was thus fairly mild.  I then headed over to the local mall and spent a good three hours shopping.  I was looking mostly for gifts for my parents but I seemed to find more gifts for myself.  Not surprising.  

Kat called me soon after that saying that she was mostly ready for her trip and that we should hang out for a bit.  We originally decided to grab coffee some place, but by the time we actually got around to leaving her place, it was dinner time.  She felt like Mexican, so we started off toward Fremont since she knew of a fairly authentic restaurant out that way.  Traffic over the bridge to Seattle was horrendous, so we turned back to Bellevue.  We hit  urlLink Spazzo , which recently changed from Mediterranean to Italian. and had a fairly nice meal.  The wine was better than the entrees and the goat cheese appetizer was served with bread that was impossibly hard and terribly over-soaked in olive oil.  All in all, a nice evening, as most are with her!  

Today was completely lazy...  I didn't do anything productive until 3 PM, unless you count making eggs for breakfast and playing an hour of Grand Theft Auto III as productive.  Russ and I visited  urlLink Caffe Ladro  so I could read more of The Brothers Karamazov and he could study for accounting.  It was good going out with him since we spend so much time in the apartment.

      Sorry that I disappeared for a few days there; I have a good reason.  On Monday while playing racquetball, I severely injured my knee again.  
Here is how I did it.  Instead of wearing my normal cross-trainer shoes to play rball, I was wearing my turf shoes.  Turf shoes have amazing traction on almost any surface, including the hardwood floor of the rball court.   Whenever I land from a jump, I keep my foot perpendicular to my shoulders until I land, when I rotate my foot away from my body for added balance.  that is how you are supposed to land.  Well, when I landed this time, I went to rotate my foot but my shoe decided to have super traction and not move.  All of the rotational force went straight to the inner portion of my left knee.  
It was 10 PM by the time I got home, so I couldn't see a doctor on Monday.  The next morning, I waited until I heard from Kat to make an appointment since I figured her dad (a doctor) would be able to make a good recommendation.  When I called to make an appointment at 11 AM, they were booked for the day and I had to wait until Wednesday.  The x-ray shows that I definitely did some serious damage and that I also have a bone shard taken off the medial portion of my left knee.  Because of the amount of swelling, the doc recommended that I get an MRI.  That was done the same day but I will not get the results until at least Friday afternoon.  The current prognosis is a torn MCL, stretched ACL, torn meniscus and the bone shard.  Lovely.  
I'm currently wearing a huge brace but the pain is not so bad.  It comes and goes and luckily I can walk fairly well.  I missed a day and a half of work, so I'm a bit behind now.

      Disclaimer:  For no real reason, I have always disliked Walmart.  Maybe it was because, for the longest time, there were no Walmarts nearby either my hometown of Livonia, MI or my college town of Ann Arbor, MI.  That has since changed, with stores in or near both cities.  Maybe it was because Walmart always had a southern, poor slant to it.  Maybe it was because we had a similar store, Meijer's, in our area and I was pledging a local allegiance.  For whatever reason, I never liked Walmart.  

I've always heard that Walmart was an "evil" company.  From details like hiring illegal aliens for stock and cleaning work to treating "regular" employees poorly to pushing around suppliers, the comments swirled around and painted a dirty portrait.  When I was back working at the Daily with Scott as my manager, he spoke of Walmart as being worse than an other company he knew of.  He had facts from reputible sources, and though being an activist, used them properly.  Now having read this  urlLink article  from fastcompany.com, I'm starting to see the details about how Walmart interacts with suppliers.  From first glance, it does seem evil, overbearing and monopolistic.  At the same time, isn't that what capitalism is all about?  A mostly-free market for companies to do as they please?  Walmart doesn't force smaller suppliers to cut costs, Walmart is just such a large and successful company that the small suppliers need to be up to Walmart standards.  

I won't go so far as to condone their practices and I do agree that Walmart needs to improve their human rights issues, but don't fault a company for being successful.

      My parents were here for a week during the holidays.  There aren't too many highlights, since we decided to keep the vacation relaxing.  We didn't want it to be one of those vacations where you have to keep to a schedule and cram in as much as possible.  They didn't even go to the Space Needle!  Some of the places we did end up going were Snoqualmie Falls, Pike Place (NOT a good place for someone in a wheelchair) and a casino in Tulalip.  Other highlights include me making five batches of scones, cooking Christmas dinner and then Kat meeting my parents on the last night they were here.  I believe it was beneficial to have them out here, for both parties.  For thier sake, they got to see how I am living my life and meet some of the new people in my life.  For my sake, I got to see them for a little while in the comfort of my own home without having to break much from my normal routine.

      Dialing the time machine back to about a month ago...  
So, the holiday parties last month.  All three parties were right in a row this year:  Thursday was the organization-wide party at EMP, Friday was the team-wide party at a lodge at Snoqualmie Pass and Saturday was Kat's party at some little restaurant in Puyallup.  Thursday started off very slowly.  I was supposed to meet some of the younger members of my team at EMP around 7:30 PM and eventhough I got there at 7:45 PM, I was still early.  Eventually, everyone showed up and the party picked up.  The food was good, but the two drink tickets didn't last very long.  Being the ingenious people that we are, us Microsoft people, we figured out that we could simply exit the building, come back in, show our ID and get two more tickets.  Of course I didn't do this, but my ID was used by a non-Microsoftie for this purpose.  Afterward, a few of us were supposed to go out to a bar, but we all parted ways for a bit and we were supposed to reconvene 15 minutes later.   15 minutes later, one of the girls still hadn't showed up.  We were all a bit drunk and antsy to get away from the formal party, so we just left.  Four of us went over to a friends place and continued the drinking and watched some TV.  I ended up fitting five people in my car, dropped them all off, and called it a night.  
The next day, the team party was supposed to start at 10 AM, but since I knew there was no rush, I didn't end up getting there until 12:30 PM.  The drive up to Snoqualmie Pass was interesting at least for the fact that it was the first snow I had ever seen in Washington.  The farther up the mountain, the more snow there was (shocking, I know).  By the time I hit the exit for the Pass, traffic was down to 30 MPH.  I actually passed someone on my team on the exit, which wasn't surprising since he had a RWD Bimmer with bald tires.  Anyway, most of the day was pretty laid back.  A few of the highlights included me running the white elephant gift exchange (including a box of old Atari games, a Nascar coffee table book and a bike axle), playing DDR, and a snowball fight that included someone in a hot tub.  I picked up Kat from the airport that night, but I can't remember the rest of the evening.  
The final day of holiday parties was at some crappy little restaurant in a crappy little town far far south of Seattle.  This was with Kat's coworkers, who had an average age of just about 35.  It was slightly odd socializing with them, but luckily we got a table with the friendliest of the bunch.  The food was horrible, the drinks were crap, and the supposed white elephant gift exchange wasn't!  Kat brought a gag gift, since that's the point of a white elephant gift exchange, yet some of the other gifts included a fondue set, a set of nice martini glasses and a clock from Pottery Barn.  For dessert, I ordered decaf coffee.  Since I was awake until 5 AM and got about two hours of sleep all night, I believe it wasn't decaf.  Anyway, the parties overall were typical work holiday parties.

      So, I've heard of mice with too many additional buttons to be useful, but thankfully my new mouse just has left click, right click, scroll wheel, scroll up button, scroll down button, task switch and then two currently unassigned buttons that I would assume are used for forward and backward in a web browser.  That may sound like a lot of buttons, but I think of the scroll up and down buttons as just an extension of the wheel and the task switch button is miniscule.    Now the keyboard on the other hand is just asinine.  Along with the normal keys that a normal keyboard has (letters, numbers, punctuation, navigation and keypad), this one has seperate keys for scrolling, go, back, sleep, f-lock, e-mail, messenger/sms, webcam, media, mute, volume up/down, last track, next track, stop, play, iTouch, search, shopping, favorites, and my home.  Additionally to that, it has a function key to enable new, reply, forward, send, undo, redo, print, save, my computer, my documents, my pictures, and my music.  To make matters worse, they labeled the normal control key functions like undo, cut, copy and paste.  They keyboard is just a little bit overboard!

      Living in the land of coffee, I have yet to be impressed by the coffee shops available out here.  There is no end to the number of Starbucks available and there is a healthy dose of Tully's as well.  The only place I've enjoyed so far has been Caffe Ladro, and they are only located in Seattle proper.  Well, today I found out about a place in Redmond called Victor's, located at 7993 Gilman St.  I will have to give it a try soon!

      Last night, I originally planned on leaving work a bit early, taking a nap, having a quick bite to eat and then hitting the gym with Jeff.  None of that happened!  Around 5:30 PM, Eric and I were talking about the new laptop he just ordered.  I told him not to buy Office from Dell since I could get a good deal on a legit copy of Office 2003 from work.  I decided to run to the company store right then since I was tired and needed a bit of fresh air.  After that, Lee sent me a chat request and convinced me to join him and some of his MS friends for dinner.  We went to Cucina Cucina (a decent to mediocre italian restaurant, thankfully we get 2-for-1 specials) and had a fun time.  It was good to meet new people, but I sometimes forget how horribly dorky we can all be.  I explained how Microsofties and non-Microsofties have difficulty mingling and there needs to be a certain percentage (we estimated 60%) of non-Microsofties for a group to work.  
I still planned on going to the gym with Jeff, but he was feeling fairly comfortable at home and wanted to skip it.  Good thing, since Russ called me soon after wanting to get drinks to unwind from a 13 hour day.  We went to  urlLink Tap House , he got dinner and I got a liquid dinner of an Emerald City Tea and a Manhattan.  I pretty much ordered the tea (vodka, gin, rum, midori, pineapple, sprite) because it already looked like Russ and I were on a date, so I had to get something fruity and served in a hurricane glass.  The Manhattan was used to bring up my testosterone levels afterward.  We had a good discussion and I'm glad I skipped working out.  I can always go a bit harder tonight.

      Kat and I had quite a relaxing and enjoyable weekend, if I may say so myself.  Originally, we had planned to go to  urlLink Dahlia Lounge  for dinner on Friday, but we both had a hard week and figured we wouldn't be up for such a nice dinner.  Instead, we ended up going to  urlLink Wasabi Bistro  and had some of the best sushi available in Western Washington.  We tried two of their signature rolls, the Spicy 101 and the Belltown.  Other than an overabundance of mayo on the Spicy 101, the meal was great.  Kat had a craving for edamame and that was satisfied by the complementary bowl served with every dinner.  
Much of Saturday morning was spent lounging around my apartment, but it was definitely not a waste of time.  Much of the afternoon was spent at Starbucks:  Kat doing work, me just playing around on the internet.  That evening, we made the  urlLink first meal in her new townhome .  We made spinach and cheese ravioli, fresh bread and a mixed greens salad.  All in all, very enjoyable.  Before we could make dinner, however, I had to put together the table and chairs we would need to eat off!  I've gotten pretty good at putting together Ikea furniture, so it didn't take too long.  
Sunday saw me fighting with my server for a good part of the afternoon and then having dinner at Kat's parents.  We played a dominos game called Mexican Train and then had a lovely filet dinner.  Her dad and I did most of the talking, but I think everyone enjoyed themselves.

      It's Fifteen Minute Photoshop&reg; time!  
Basically, my bedroom is not in the most optimal configuration.  Both of my tall bookshelves are covering up one window completely and part of another window.  So, I started thinking about alternative arrangements.  Knowning me, I couldn't just visualize this or write it out on a sheet paper, I decided to measure and model my room in Photoshop.  
   
It's pretty hard to see on the left, but there is a long window there.  The upper left red line is another window.  The red line on the right is the bathroom door.  Here is my suggested layout:  
   
This clears both windows (since the dresser fits underneath the window and the sides of the bed are not against the bed) and seems like a good idea.  Bah, no time to do it tonight.

      I've been wrestling with hardware issues for about four days now.  That is what I get for naming a server fireball!  Basically, the machine that has been my internet router, NAT box, development web server, database server, RDP proxy has gone through quite a few upgrades.  It originally was my old overclocking desktop (thus, "fireball") running a 300 MHz Celeron.  It was upgraded to a 500 MHz PIII and it currently has a 700 MHz Duron.  A month or so ago, I bought a new 120 GB drive for my desktop (thanks,  urlLink Slickdeals !) and last week I finally got around to putting my old 30 GB drive into fireball.  
The problems started then.  Since the 30 GB drive was already in my desktop, I decided to install OpenBSD 3.4 on the drive before transferring it to the server.  That install went smoothly, but the drive would not boot when I transferred it.  I figured it just didn't like the transfer, so I reinstalled OpenBSD while in fireball.  When I tried to boot after the second install, the bootloader would come up with crap like "@$%&@#$&*@#$#$%!@#(&(^%".  After 45 minutes of playing around with the bootloader, the BIOS and the boot sequence, I finally figured out that it wouldn't boot unless the drive was the primary on the IDE chain.  Ok, finally got the new drive up and running!  When installing OBSD, my first steps are to install the ports tree, tcsh, vim, the source and add 'mbibik' as a user.  I got as far as compiling tcsh static when the machine just froze, hard.  I figured, whatever, just a random lockup.   Nope, anytime I taxed the processor, the machine would freeze.  Obviously (at least to me), this seemed like a heat issue.  I opened the case to check out the CPU fan, but it's a fairly small (AKA cramped) case so I couldn't see the fan behind the power supply.  I monitored the CPU temp and it never seemed to get into dangerous territory.   
I gave up at this point and told Russell the internet would be down for awhile (no server, no NAT, no internet).  I started to play with it again, but there isn't much you can do when the damned thing freezes every 15 minutes!  I gave up trying to install tcsh, vim, etc and just started surfing the net from my desktop.  Oddly enough, it didn't lock up.  At this point, I realized that interactive activities such as installing or compiling are probably accessing the disk more than just using the box as a router (which would only access the disk to periodically write logs).  I switched back to the old drive, and all is well.  Too bad my 30 GB drive is fried!

      I should have posted this as soon as I woke up this morning, but I can never seem to get going until 1.5 hours after I wake up.  Unless I wake up late, I will kill 1.5 hours every morning.  Granted, I consider my drive to work to be killed time simply because I am nowhere near fully awake and thus I drive by instinct.  Listening to commercials the entire way there is not uncommon, simply because I am not paying attention whatsoever.  Anyway, the post.  
The remembered dream from last night consisted of some sort of party.  It was possibly a party for me, or just a party in general.  I believe it was a party for me since I was given a car (an Audi TT, or at least the shell of one.   Someone said the rest would be in next week.  Odd choice of car since I do not and have never wanted a TT.) and there was an interesting gag gift.  Basically, someone took all of my prized possesions, which curiously included a house, shrunk them down and locked them in a glass case for everyone to look at.  All throughout the party I never noticed this case.  Once everyone had left, it finally revealed itself and of course I tried to pry it open to retreive my things!  It was a long case, probably 12 feet long and 3 feet wide and high.  The case was in segments, each with a sealed door.  After attempting to pry each door open, the last segment contained what looked like just a piece of yellow paper.  This door opened, and out flew a few miniature (fruit fly-sized) bees!  I'm not allergic nor phobic of bees, but I am not a fan.  For some reason, my mind told me that an ex-girlfriend, Emily, had done all of this.  Made no sense!

I consider mysef a pretty cool guy and I've never cheated on any of my girlfriends.  Well, except that one lil' time in Japan, but that was just head and head don't count, right?  Aww, thanks god, I knew you'd understand.  Well, I just feel like, well to be honest with you, god, I just need a sweet bitch.  Ya know, somebody not too fast, but not too slow, 'cause I dont have it all my damn self and life ain't easy.  Ya know you just want someone by your side to help smooth that thang out.  At this point, I'm not being picky, she doesn't have to have a big ol' ass, ya know.  Just something well proportioned to her body, ya know a nice lil' tail.  What, you say, you say you found somebody?  Is she cute?  So when do I get to meet her?  Aww, god, you're the greatest.  Well, I guess I'll talk to you later.  Amen.   oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, a-lady.

      Tis the time to start questioning my health.  Let's just say that for a past few months I've been having some odd issues for someone my age.  Just today, I had a serious headache kick in around 2:00 PM.  At first, it seemed to be another caffeine-based headache, but my caffeine intake has been quite minimal lately.  Instead of trying to fight it, I just called it a day and went home to rest.  Though I didn't feel tired until the headache kicked in and I've been getting adequate sleep, I ended up taking a 2.5 hour nap.  I'm still feeling a bit groggy.  Let's just chalk all of these problems to stress and not enough exercise (at least lately) and hope they all go away.  Ignore it; it will go away.

      Procrastinating between posts requires a Herculean effort to catch up.   Sigh.  
Well, last weekend I went back to Detroit for the second time in three weeks.  The main reason for going back was to attend the  urlLink auto show  and to see friends and family.  I arrived around 6 AM, rented a car, drove back to Livonia and just fell down dead in my bed.  Once noon rolled around, my aunt and I went to the Plymouth Ice Show ( urlLink image gallery ) and just hung out for a bit.  The ice sculptures cannot really be considered art, though some of the pieces showed some technical skill and creativity.  Also, art doesn't usually melt after two weeks...  It was cold enough for my body to shut down blood flow to my hands, so much so that I had difficulty using keys to get back into the car to get warm.  
The rest of the evening was spent with Chris.  We hit Twelve Oaks to grab some  urlLink Panera  (they really need to open one here in Washington:  fresh and chewy breads, sharp cheeses and choice cuts of meat make a great sandwich) and then sat around his place until the Chris and Lindsay engagement party ( urlLink image gallery ) started.  It was a laid back affair consisting of wine and beer and conversation.  This was the first party I've been to with Megan, Iren and Lindsday where they didn't go on a 1.5 hour tangent about their childhood, a discussion which no one else can participate in.  No offense girls, just don't do that again!  I talked to Marty for a bit and his opening bit was classic Marty:  
Ma: "Have you ever watched Twin Peaks?" 
Mi: "Not really, a few episodes, but I know you are a big fan." 
Ma: "So why did you go to Snoqualmie then?" 
My first reaction was that this was just Marty being Marty (if you know him, you know what I mean.  Otherwise, you aren't going to meet him, so don't worry about it), and then I realized that Twin Peaks was filmed in Washington, near a waterfall and then it clicked.  I didn't feel like defending my choice to visit Snoqualmie for a non-Twin Peaks reason and Marty was just trying to show that he has been following my site.  Casey, one of the Northvillians that Chris used to hang out with every week back in high school, was also at the party.  By the eighth beer, he was becoming quite the extrovert.  He knew what he was doing, so he was enjoying the party laughing at him whilst he laughed inside.  
The next morning was the auto show ( urlLink image gallery ) with my dad and grandpa.  Honestly and unfortunately, I wasn't terribly impressed with the show this year.  That shouldn't be much of a surprise since this is the first year where I've been in the actual market for a car.  Previously, I was most excited about the exotic concept cars but now I want to see vechicles that are in showrooms that I can and want to purchase.  Since I just recently purchased a car, I was looking toward the future, toward what should be my next car.  Based on the fact that the Focus is a three-year purchase, that will put my next round at the summer of 2006.  Considering that I should be able to afford a much nicer car, I was looking at the BMW M3 and the Audi S4 as possibilities.  I took many pictures of each, and got a good feel inside and out for the look of the cars.  The M3 has a terribly dated interior and it will be redesigned within the next 18 months.  The redesign could take the car in any direction, basically invalidating any observation of the current model.  The S4 has a delicious interior and the exterior styling is sedate enough yet still sporty.  While this car is a sedan, the back seat leg room is laughable at best.  With the drivers seat fully back, I could barely fit in the S4.  In contrast, I had plenty of leg room in the Infiniti G35 coupe, though head room was an issue there.  Hopefully by the time I am completely fed up with the Focus, a new car will hit my target requirements: 
0-60 MPH  
Mature styling, inside and out (no more thoughts of the STi or Evo) 
High  urlLink build quality  (Odd, I didn't realize that Audi was so far down the list...) 
Ample room for 4 
More to come 
I wholeheartedly recommend the Infiniti site for  urlLink car comparison .  Their tool pulls in just about every specification you need for comparing cars.  
Ok, enough for one post.

Anyway, after having debated for a few years in high school, I learned a few terms for debate tactics, but here is an  urlLink entire site  with terms for each fallacy.  Honestly, I must have observed all of these at one time or another.  A few are extremely frustrating because it is almost as hard to explain the fallacy as it is to fight in the debate.  Some examples are  urlLink burden of proof ,  urlLink confusing cause and effect  (seems easy to explain, just try with some people!), and  urlLink straw man .  I will admit that I have used a handful of these fallacies as well, but I usually know I am using them.  They are only used when I do not have quite enough evidence to back up my clain so I attempt to hoodwink someone with a fallacy while I think of better evidence.  If someone catches me in the fallacy, now I can give an offical term for the fallacy to show that I genuinely knew what I was doing.

      I believe George Carlin said it best:  

Here is my problem with the ten commandments- why exactly are there 10?  

You simply do not need ten. The list of ten commandments was artificially and deliberately inflated to get it up to ten. Here's what happened:  

About 5,000 years ago a bunch of religious and political hustlers got together to try to figure out how to control people and keep them in line. They knew people were basically stupid and would believe anything they were told, so they announced that God had given them some commandments, up on a mountain, when no one was around.  

Well let me ask you this- when they were making this shit up, why did they pick 10? Why not 9 or 11? I'll tell you why- because 10 sound official. Ten sounds important! Ten is the basis for the decimal system, it's a decade, it's a psychologically satisfying number (the top ten, the ten most wanted, the ten best dressed). So having ten commandments was really a marketing decision! It is clearly a bullshit list. It's a political document artificially inflated to sell better. I will now show you how you can reduce the number of commandments and come up with a list that's a little more workable and logical. I am going to use the Roman Catholic version because those were the ones I was taught as a little boy.  

Let's start with the first three:  

I AM THE LORD THY GOD THOU SHALT NOT HAVE STRANGE GODS BEFORE ME  

THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN  

THOU SHALT KEEP HOLY THE SABBATH  

Right off the bat the first three are pure bullshit. Sabbath day? Lord's name? strange gods? Spooky language! Designed to scare and control primitive people. In no way does superstitious nonsense like this apply to the lives of intelligent civilized humans in the 21st century. So now we're down to 7. Next:  

HONOR THY FATHER AND MOTHER  

Obedience, respect for authority. Just another name for controlling people. The truth is that obedience and respect shouldn't be automatic. They should be earned and based on the parent's performance. Some parents deserve respect, but most of them don't, period. You're down to six.  

Now in the interest of logic, something religion is very uncomfortable with, we're going to jump around the list a little bit.  

THOU SHALT NOT STEAL  

THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS  

Stealing and lying. Well actually, these two both prohibit the same kind of behavior- dishonesty. So you don't really need two you combine them and call the commandment "thou shalt not be dishonest". And suddenly you're down to 5.  

And as long as we're combining I have two others that belong together:  

THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTRY  

THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE  

Once again, these two prohibit the same type of behavior. In this case it is marital infidelity. The difference is- coveting takes place in the mind. But I don't think you should outlaw fantasizing about someone else's wife because what is a guy gonna think about when he's waxing his carrot? But, marital infidelity is a good idea so we're gonna keep this one and call it "thou shalt not be unfaithful". And suddenly we're down to four.  

But when you think about it, honesty and infidelity are really part of the same overall value so, in truth, you could combine the two honesty commandments with the two fidelity commandments and give them simpler language, positive language instead of negative language and call the whole thing "thou shalt always be honest and faithful" and we're down to 3.  

THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR"S GOODS  

This one is just plain fuckin' stupid. Coveting your neighbor's goods is what keeps the economy going! Your neighbor gets a vibrator that plays "o come o ye faithful", and you want one too! Coveting creates jobs, so leave it alone. You throw out coveting and you're down to 2 now- the big honesty and fidelity commandment and the one we haven't talked about yet:  

THOU SHALT NOT KILL  

Murder. But when you think about it, religion has never really had a big problem with murder. More people have been killed in the name of god than for any other reason. All you have to do is look at Northern Ireland, Cashmire, the Inquisition, the Crusades, and the World Trade Center to see how seriously the religious folks take thou shalt not kill. The more devout they are, the more they see murder as being negotiable. It depends on who's doin the killin' and who's gettin' killed. So, with all of this in mind, I give you my revised list of the two commandments:  

Thou shalt always be honest and faithful to the provider of thy nookie.  

and  

Thou shalt try real hard not to kill anyone, unless of course they pray to a different invisible man than you.  

Two is all you need; Moses could have carried them down the hill in his fuckin' pocket. I wouldn't mind those folks in Alabama posting them on the courthouse wall, as long as they provided one additional commandment:  

Thou shalt keep thy religion to thyself.

      I haven't posted an actual update in far too long.  Let's dial back the Wheel of Time&trade;.  
I finally moved off the Daily servers for both my email and my web hosting.  The email wasn't a big deal since Yahoo is free and I just forward everything from umich anyway.  Keep emailing me at mbibik at umich dot edu, since I might not stay with Yahoo.  The web hosting, on the other hand, was a big deal.  My gallery was taking up at least a gig and no host would charge less than $39/month for that much space.  Well, I found a free host for most of my site and then I'm hosting the galleries at home (thus the mbibik.dyndns.org URL).   No, I can't tell you where I'm hosting, but you can sort of figure it out if you are smart.  
Kat and I have been up and down lately, but she is in Italy for two weeks so hopefully things will improve (absense makes the heart, blah blah blah).  Unfortunately, she had a slight hiccup with her flight plans!  Her flight from Seattle to Chicago left on time, but due to weather it couldn't land and had to circle for an extra two hours.  This made her miss the connecting flight from Chicago to Rome!  Her sister flew in from North Carolina so they could fly together to Rome so she skipped the flight to be with Kat.  Now they are both trying to find another flight to Rome.  The next direct flight that is available isn't until Saturday night and American Airlines keeps telling them to fly to London and then home for a standby flight to Rome.  No matter what, I would be very upset.   You can't really get pissed since there is no control over the weather, but very upset nontheless.  
My car is really pissing me off lately.   Purchased on 06/27/2003 for about $18k and 8 months later it is only worth $10k.  I still owe about that much!  Anyway, it looks like I haven't posted about my car problems over the past few months.  My CEL (check engine light) came on during normal driving.  Nothing seemed amis, but I made a service appointment anyway.  By the time the appointment arrived, the CEL was off.  They took it and ran some tests anyway.  They replaced a fuel hose and said the car should be fine.  I took it home that night and the CEL went back on the very next day!  I waited a couple weeks before making another appointment.  During those few weeks, the CEL would go on for a couple days then go back off for awhile.  Nothing really seemed wrong with the car until I checked my fuel logs.  The car was getting 17 MPG!  This car is rated for 27 MPG, so something was definitely borked.  I took it in and this time the CEL was on when they received it.  They replaced an 02 sensor and again said the car was fine.  Well, I completely grannied the next tank of gas and got 22 MPG.  Not bad, but not good either.  I went back to my normal driving style and I'm still getting 17 MPG.  I could be driving a WRX for that sort of gas mileage!  I talked to the service tech and he claims he has seens Focii get 17 MPG and there was no solution.  Great.  
I finally just decided to ignore the gas mileage since I'm not driving that much anyway.  About two weeks ago, I was simply changing a preset on my radio and it decides to completely freak out.  Now, it goes through this cycle of playing 0.5 seconds of music then turning off for 1.5 seconds, constantly rebooting.  What make its even more annoying is that you have a 0.2 second window while the radio is off to hit the power button so that it will stay off.  I'm sure I can fix it by pulling the plug (disconnect the battery), I just haven't gotten around to it.

      How sad is it that my car is worth less than what I currently owe on it?   I mean, obviously that would be the case if I had just bought it or if I paid a very low down payment.   I put down $4k and the car is now 9 months old (and a 2003 model).  Gotta love almost 50% depreciation in less than a year.  Sigh.

I still remember the day that Chris brought over his copy of GTA:3 for Joe and I to try.  He had to take it away from us a few weeks later since he was going to re-gift it, but I went right out and bought another copy.  Joe eventually traded it in for GTA:Vice City but I was never as impressed with VC.  It just didn't have the same feeling since the character that you played actually had a voice and some emotion.  I much rather enjoyed the voiceless character in 3.  Thus, I bought another copy of 3!  I just need a PS2 to go with it now...

      Setting:   A Gameworks or some sort of gaming facility.  Lots of old people, dimly lit, similar to a casino in that respect.  Basically, it had the feel of a Gameworks, casino and bowling alley combined.  
First scene:  I'm sitting down and playing some sort of matching game, seems like Mastermind, with quarters.  An older lady approaches from nowhere and demands to know where my gamer card is (If you have been to Gameworks or Dave & Busters, you know that instead of using quarters, you get a credit card of sorts that you can put money on.  I show a pocket full of quarters, implying that I'm just playing with quarters and she storms off.   She returns about 5 minutes later and hands me a large stack of gamer chips (4 $25, 2 $10, 2 $5, 4 $1) and a fist fill of Twizzlers.  The look she gives me as she walks off was, "I've been in your place before, kid.  Have some fun and enjoy the sugar!".  Possibly she thought I was poor since I only showed about 5 dollars with in quarters.  I vaguely remember winning a lot of money on the Mastermind game and then being given a tour of the facility.  The man in charge was giving the tour and reminded me of  urlLink Tom Poston  from the Newhart show, but with a suit that Rod Roddy would wear.   Well, a suit he would have worn, since he  urlLink died  of breast cancer.  During the tour, I remember passing by a small room in the back with mirrors on the walls and a rainbow motif adorning the ceiling.  He said that was in case anyone felt like dancing and could also be rented out.  Oddly enough, it was empty and the lights were off.  I can only imagine how those rainbows would look with the full house lights!  I know I would want to shake my groove thang, and probably go suck on a popsicle or eat some sausage.  
Second scene:  The dream gets fuzzy for a bit, but I remember after the tour there was this one counter way in the back with no one around it.  The person running it is none other than Beth Manoongian, an "acquaintance" from school.  This game was a trivia game with a twist.  The questions are extremely difficult but the prize for answering a single question runs in the millions of dollars.  I decide to give it a shot, hoping that Beth will help me out a little bit.  As she pulls the question from a long box of cards, she places it on ledge face down in front of me, then gets a phone call.  While she isn't watching, I try to see what the answer is, but can't quite make it out.  It looks like "Yeh" to me backwards.  The question was something like "What is the beach on Jo Beach?".  Sort of a trick question, but I thought I already had the answer.   I hem and haw for a bit, then exclaim "Yeh!".  The answer was actually "Lev", which doesn't make sense to me in the dream or in the waking world.  Since playing the game is free, I have her pull out another card.  By this time, someone else has joined me at the counter.  This person seemed to be between 18-22 years old, male, dark hair, reminded me of a frat boy.  The next question wasn't even a question, it was something along the lines of "(SomeForeignName) is furious."  I think the riddle was that you had to figure out the country that would give out a name like that then give the translation for "furious".  The random guy and I looked at each other trying to figure it out and then I woke up.  
I should rent out my brain for studies into the abnormal.

      So the first inline hockey game was yesterday!   Lee and I got there 1.5 hours early so that we could sign up for the league, meet the team and do a little bit of practicing.  The facility is fairly ghetto, located in what looks like an old warehouse.  It is seperated into a little practice field for soccer, the inline rink, then a larger soccer field.  The rink itself is in good condition with an interesting plastic flooring that reminds me of the plastic used for milk crates or toddlers blocks (not the shiny kind).    We only got about 20 minutes of practice in, but it was tiring.  I know that when I got off the rink at the start of the game, I was drenched in sweat.   
We ended up losing 5-4, but I scored twice and Lee scored as well!  We both received praise during and after the game which made us both feel a bit better about playing.  Everyone seems very nice and laid back which is exactly what I was hoping for.  Our first practice is tomorrow (yes, we had a game before we practiced) so hopefully my sore knee and arm feel better!

       urlLink New Scientist :  It looks like the "fact" that mammals do not produce new eggs after birth may be incorrect.  With a study done on mice, it appears that the number of living eggs decreases too rapidly for the number of eggs available at birth to persist until menopause.  To test if new eggs were created, an ovary from a normal mouse was inplanted into a mouse that was genetically modified to generate a glowing protein in all new cells.  After transplant, eggs were observed with the glowing protein, practically confirming that new eggs are created after birth.

      Well, I just joined an inline hockey league!  We have games every Tuesday, starting tomorrow, for 12 weeks at  urlLink Arena Sports .  Lee introduced me to the team and we are both going to be on the core roster.  I was originally on the substitute list but someone from the core team dropped out.  
So, I've played a lot of street hockey, but I've never played on a team or in any sort of organization fashion.  The closest I've come to organization was playing at Elbel Field in Ann Arbor where they kept a list of players.  First come, first serve, so as a person decided to take a break, the next person on the list got to hop in.  That pales in comparison to a real league, so I cannot even imagine what I'm in for tomorrow night.  I've watched enough hockey in my life to know what to do!  Right, I'll be just fine.  No worries.   I'm going to die.  
Anyway, Russ and I decided that hockey is the most expensive game to play that does not require an animal (polo, cockfighting, etc).  I already owned skates and a stick, I didn't buy top of the line gear and I still spent $435 dollars.  Things I needed: helmet, elbow pads, cup, girdle, shin pads, inline pants and a hockey bag.  I better play this game for more than a season...  I'm a dork, so of course there are  urlLink pictures .

      Consumerist Whore:  So awhile back, I sold my GameCube, memory card, Metroid Prime (wanted to write "Metroit Prime", too much time spent in the Motor City, I guess), Super Mario Sunshine and Prince of Persia to GameStop for a whopping $101.  When you sell used games and consoles, they give you store credit.  This credit comes in the form of a receipt with a unique alphanumeric.  When the cashier gives you said receipt, he/she is supposed to impart the words of wisdom "DO NOT LOSE THIS."  Well, I lost it!  Luckily, I was dorky enough to write down said alphanumeric and GameSpot was able to reissue the receipt.  Let's see how long it takes before I lose it again.  
Anyway, the point of this post was that I went to the mall to get the reissued receipt and ended up going shopping for myself.  I ended up buying two pairs of stain, spill and wrinkle resistant pants at the Gap and three shirts over at Express.  When I went to the get the receipt reissued, the manager said that he woudl probably call me on Tuesday with the reissue since he has to call corporate and they are closed on the weekend.  Turns out, they were open today so he told me to come pick up the receipt.  Another trip to the mall, and we all know what that means... more shopping.   I hadn't run into J. Crew or Banana Republic since I was in a bit of a rush last night.  Ended up buying my second pair of jeans, making that two pairs purchased in the past 8 months, my first pairs in at least 8 years!  J. Crew jeans are just about the only ones that fit me even close to well.  Jamie and I must have spent at least two hours looking for that first pair.  Actually, I think that only J. Crew works for jeans, Gap works for casual pants and Kenneth Cole works for dress pants.  Anyway, I ended up spending $50 for an undershirt and two pairs of boxers at Banana Republic.  Even I realize that's a waste of money, but they were cute and everyone needs underwear, right?  Mmmm,  underwear...

      So my radio crapped out awhile ago, probably at least a month ago, and I just today brought it in to be fixed.  When I dropped it off, the technician sait it would be ready this afternoon.  Around 2 PM, he called to tell me that he couldn't fix it, couldn't find a replacement and had to send it out to be fixed.  He had no ETA as to when it would be back, so he said to come pick up the car.  Well, I have the car, but  urlLink no radio or CD player !

      So, by now you have probably heard that Nintendo's next handheld will have two screens and be called the DS (D = Dual/Double S = Screen). Take a look at this  urlLink mockup  posted to Gizmodo.  The angled design immediately screams to me "This is better because it is different!", but just think about the ergnomics.  Hold your hands in front of you as if you were trying to hold something a bit smaller than a paperback book, lengthways.  You don't curl your wrists outward and your fingers upward, as you would have to with this design.  I can see a large number of young gamers developing carpal tunnel if this design got the green light.  (I'm going to refrain from jokes about other causes of carpal tunnel in young male gamers.)  
A common question about the Pocket PC Phone that I carry around is "Can it play games?"  Well, the answer is yes, but why bother?  The overall form factor is wrong, requiring you to interlace your fingers to hold the device with two hands.  Additionally, there is a directional pad and four buttons, but the pad only supports the four cardinal directions (not diagonals) and two of the buttons are toward the top of the screen.  Basically, I wouldn't even try playing pong on this thing.  Hell, I have nethack install on it and even that is impossible to play.

      Woohoo, go  urlLink Markko !  He only one a single stage of the entire rally, but "slow and steady wins the race".  Ok, in all actuality, having your strongest competitor get slapped with a  urlLink 5 minute penalty  wins the race.  If you don't want to read the link, basically Petter Solberg had some electrical issues before the start of a stage.  He and his codriver tried to push the car uphill to make it to the starting line in time.  There were already 4 minutes late, giving them a 40 second penalty when the officials realized they received help from the spectators to reach the starting line.  That tacked on an additional 5 minute penalty eventhough neither the driver nor codriver asked for the help.  With a final time difference of 3 minutes and 14.7 seconds from Markko Martin, Solberg would have won.  As Russ said, he probably wouldn't have pushed so hard if it wasn't for that 5 minute and 40 second penalty.

      Dream Update:  The dream from last night concerned me entering some sort of car show.  The show was held in a building similar to Cobo Hall where the North American International Auto Show is held.  The first part of the dream is quite fuzzy, but it involved Jeff, Russ and I driving quite a long distance from home to the show, trailering my show car.  The car was a fairly sedate blue; brighter than Ford Racing blue but not as bright as Subaru World Rally blue.  I have no idea what type of car it was, though my mind told me it was an Acura RSX.  I'm not even sure what sort of car show it was, but I knew that I had to perform something.  Possibly just drive it around for show, possibly drag race it, possibly drift it, who knows!  
After we got to the show, there was quite a bit of time before I had to drive, so we walked around.  As we walked around, I realized that I had forgotten the keys to the show car!  Since it was trailered there, I didn't need the keys.  Oddly enough, I found out that I was carrying one of my old keys from the Michigan Daily and it worked as a master key for the entire showroom building.  Again, oddly enough, all of the mens bathrooms were closed so all of the womens bathrooms became co-ed.    While Jeff, Russ and I were walking back down to the parking garage so that we could go get the keys to the show car, we ran into a group of about six people.  We were in a small hallway at a bend, so it was a tight fit to get all 9 people through.  The groups sort of collided, then the six people swarmed us.  My first thought was to check our wallets.  They didn't actually steal our wallets, but Jeff had lost all of his IDs and all of his money except for singles.  Just at the end of the altercation, I some how stole back all of Jeff's IDs and a huge stack of money.  I checked my wallet at this point, and it actually had more money in it than before!  At first, I was pleased, then I checked the bills.  A 300 hundred dollar bill?  Another bill that had multiple denominations on it (I remember one that had "$300", "$133" and "$16" all on the same bill)?  Another bill that had some sort of religious message on the back instead of a visual scene?  This was where I woke up.

      I am absolutely amazed by this  urlLink review  of Dawn of the Dead.  Not because it is a bad review, not because it is a funny review, not because the review is dramatically wrong but because this is a review for parents.  This is one of the most gore-filled movies I have ever seen, lots of swearing, some nudity and sexual situations and all of the other great things that give movies an R rating.  There is even a handy table listing issues such as "Profanity", "Nudity/Sex" and even "Diversity Issues."  You would figure that the review would be horribly opposed to anyone young seeing this and especially not making this family affair.  Au contrair, the review is suprisingly positive without a lick of conservative America "hide your children from this filth" opinion.  The review even gives discussion topics if this movie is seen as a family!  "Families who watch this movie might wish to discuss the different approaches taken by the survivors and the range of choices that they make. Are there times when the moral answer is at odds with the instinct to survive? How would you handle this variance?"  I am amazed, and quite proud, of this site.

      I knew the addiction wasn't going to get any better when I would think back to those lovely days when I owned a video game console.  All those levels beat, all those new trophies acquired, all those end-bosses defeated...   I needed a console, and fast!  I ended up using my $101 store credit at GameStop to buy a refurbished PS2 with network adapter and another copy of Gran Turismo 3.  I still had my saved game from when Joe and I co-owned a PS2, so I fired that up.  
Last night, I ended up beating all of the rally levels.  I used the same car for all of the levels:  a heavily modified Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VII GSR, putting out about 542 HP.  There are 10 tracks on the rally circuit, 3 races per track and 2, 3 and 5 laps per race.  That means 300 rally laps to complete the entire circuit.  My car couldn't handle as well as most of the rally cars on gravel, but the sheer power got it through those tracks without fault.  On tarmac, the car could handle at least as well as the rally cars and I still had a huge power advantage.  The prize for getting all first places on the 30 different races is the  urlLink Suzuki Escudo Pikes Peak Version .  You'd think a Suzuki would be a horrible prize car, but mine is currently modified to put down 1881 HP!  Top speed is currently 278.9 MPH, nice.

      I am genuinely curious to know, on average, how many people a person knows (basically friends and family) that have committed suicide?  Personally, I believe I only know of one person.  I say believe because I have a very good ability to block out many harmful events.  I only know of one person that committed suicide at my high school during the four years I was there and I didn't actually know the person, so they aren't on my list.  There was a discussion I saw online and some people knew upwards of nine people that had ended their lives.  I guess that high of a number just made me think.  I'm still thinking.

      Car hunt update:  I got to ride along on two test drives today.  I say ride along since I had Jeff drive them for me!  I suck at manual so I didn't feel like embarrassing myself.  First was the '89 Mitsubishi Colt.  The exterior was decent with just a few bit of rust along the faded paint.  The interior, on the other hand, was well aged.  Not well aged like a wine, cheese, or whiskey, but well aged like that a high school cafeteria mom.  Bits of plastic were broken in just about every spot, including the turn indicator.  It was so broken that Jeff could barely get it to work at all.  The engine was in pretty good shape, but the clutch was really soft.  
Next up was the '92 Camaro.  The owner was about 10 minutes late, but all was forgiven when I saw the quality of this car.  There is a slight dent just behind the driver side door that is starting to rust and there is a modicum of rust above the rear passenger wheel well.  Other than that, the vehicle looked practically new!  The interior was a bit worn, but no damage.  The clutch was in good shape, the stereo is brand new, the tires are new, the battery is new and most of the suspension was new.  Needless to say, I was pretty impressed.  It was only an RS, which means that it has 140 HP but 180 lb-ft of torque (and still better than the 130 HP and 135 lb-ft in my Focus!).  Since the car is in such good shape, I really doubt that I will be able to talk him down from the $2,000 price.  
Considering how impressed I was with the car, I called up my insurance agent.  If I add a second car to my policy, it will drop the price on the Focus from $672 to $637.  Full coverage on the Camaro would be $298 and just the basics will get run me $198.  Not that bad at all!  I was originally considering paying for a parking spot in a lot near my apartment, but then I realized that I should be able to park at work.  As long as I swap cars at least once a week and move the cars around every other day, I shouldn't get in trouble from security.  As soon as they say something, I will pay for the lot ($50/month).  
If I don't think of anything I've forgotten and no one else says this is a dumb idea, I think I'm going to buy it on Monday.  I'd love to have it for the weekend, especially while Kat is gone, but I really shouldn't make a rash decision.

      The fourth FloorBurn game was last night.  We improved our record to 2-2!  Lee and I were back on a line again, but we just weren't in sync.  I was playing too far away from him and he wasn't able to get the puck up to me.  No matter what, I stole the puck deep in their end, deked the goalie and got my fourth goal of the season.  We ended up winning 4-1 and team morale was much higher than any other night.  It's possible that our practice last week really did help, but we shall see.

I cannot link to the cars since they are on an internal site, but I can tell you that one is a '92 Camaro and the other is an '83 Supra!  It would be cool to say that I owned a Supra, no matter what model year it is.  Both are in fairly decent shape, at least from what I was told.  The Supra needs a muffler, but that can't be more than $200 to replace.  I should be able to test drive both of them this week.  Maybe I will end up buying a car this week!

      I'm looking for a used car!  No, even with all of the problems with the Focus, (which I've since named Sanchez, since the car was made in Mexico and now I can make all sorts of "Dirty Sanchez" jokes) I am not thinking of replacing it for a used car.  I'm actually looking for an old manual car so that I can get better with an MT before I get a real car.  I figure, why not spend upwards of $2,000 on a used car, practice driving a manual, then sell it off for upwards of $1,500 rather than spending $1,200 on clutch replacement for a new car?  There is a parking lot a block away from my apartment where I can get a space for only $50/month.  I will put the least amount of insurance on it, so it shouldn't be too expensive of a proposition.

      I purchased my  urlLink hockey skates  (image) last year when Eric and I decided to get back into inline hockey.  The wheels that the skates came with weren't bad (Labeda Shooters) and the bearings were satisfactory (ABEC 3 rated, the lowest rating but there are worse bearings out there that aren't even rated!).  I had used the wheels quite a bit playing outdoor inline, so they were quite worn down:

The first two games of the indoor inline season were played on those wheels.  Needless to say, I fell a handful of times.  It took a few weeks of online bargain hunting, but finally I picked up a new set of wheels and bearings.

 Dream from last night:  I cannot remember the bulk of the dream, but it involved a large number of my friends from both Microsoft and UMich at a presentation of some sort.  Everyone was sitting in rows of chairs waiting for it to start.  I was supposed to drive to this with one of the devs on my team, Matt, but when I got there, he was sitting with Matt Weber.  Just before the presentation started, I remember that I borrowed Jeff's can opener and he needed it back!  I was quite concerned since this was a limited edition can opener.  Oddly enough, there were shelves and shelves of shoe boxes and skiing equipment to the side of the presentation room.  After a frantic search, I finally found the can opener at the bottom of a shoe box.  The can opener was a WRX model in Sonic Yellow, which would explain why I was frantic to find it (the Impreza WRX in Sonic Yellow is a very rare sight).  That doesn't explain why I am having crazy dreams.
 FloorBurn improved to a record of 3-2 after our 6-2 win on Tuesday.  I scored twice, so I'm back as leading scorer.
 Wall of Meat (flag football) is perfect so far at 2-0!  We had a come from behind win on Saturday with our new quarterback, but I can definitely see the team improving from here out.
 I'm getting closer to buying the Camaro.  The owner just needs to get it to pass emissions and then I will almost certainly buy it.
 The NY auto show is tomorrow thus I expect information about the 2005 Subarus to be released tomorrow.  Rumor has it that the WRX will go a complete redesign for the '06 model year, so maybe buying an '05 would be silly.  I don't want to look dated that fast!

      I can't believe I forgot to post this!  So every three months, the  urlLink Puget Sound Blood Center  sends a Bloodmobile to my campus.  I made an appointment for the first time it came around, but had to cancel it due to a meeting conflict.  The second time it came around, I went to donate without an appointment and they were full.  Finally, I got to donate yesterday.  
Since it was my first time donating with them, I had to go through the full screening process, mini interview and all.  Finally, I give blood and they have me lay down for an extra a few minutes afterward since this was my first time with them and all.  The actual process of giving blood went just fine.  As I was laying down resting, my stomach started to feel a bit nauseous.  Suddenly, the nausea got worse and I started to think about asking one of the nurses for something to vomit into.  The next thing I notice, there are three people crowded around me and I've got cold compresses on my neck and chest.  Turns out, I passed out!  I was only out for a few seconds, but it was not a pleasant experience.  Soon after I woke up, I broke out in a cold sweat.  I felt functional about 5 minutes later, but I was definitely tired and out of it for the rest of the day.  I, obviously, skipped my hockey game.

      Katherine and I went to Daniel's Broiler on Lake Union on Thursday night.  We had a $25 gift certificate, but that really doesn't go very far when the entrees are about $40 each!  The hostess treated us just like any other couple having dinner on a Thursday night, but the waiter had a different idea.  It seems that he saw two kids that were in over their heads and thus he didn't expect a large tip.  Since, in his mind, his tip was already shot, he decided to basically treat us like an annoyance.  Since I was out for a nice dinner, I ordered Perrier to start and I made Kat get some Evian even though she is a tap water kind of girl.  He brought us two glasses and two bottles and didn't even offer to pour for us.  I know, I'm getting prissy here, but come on.  While every other table received warm bread and butter before the meal, I had to specifically request it.  When it finally came, our food was ready not 2 minutes later.  When we ordered wine, he acted as if the only grape product we had ever drank was Welch's.  Thanks buddy, I know the basics of wine, and yes I do know that higher altitude wines come from a more concentrated grape.  He got most of our order correct, but he switched how Katherine and I liked our meat (I ordered medium and she ordered medium-rare and he switched them).  Kat has eaten at Daniel's probably ten times and she said this was the first time they didn't offer to cut the meat at the table to show that it was cooked properly.  Maybe he knew he had messed up.  No matter what, our waiter was still not the most annoying part of the evening!  
Soon after we had sat down, a pair of gentlemen were seated directly behind us.  Our backs were mostly turned to them, but Kat could tell that the older of the two, maybe 45-50 years old, was consistently staring at her.  This skeeved her out a bit, but was soon ignored.  After we had finished our entree and started to dig into some creme brulee, our waiter approached carrying two glasses of red wine.  He informed us that the man behind us offered two glasses of his fine Argentinean wine.  We raised our glasses and turned to the man and thanked him.  He said "Enjoy, or as we would say in Norway, Skord."  At this point, we felt fairly awkward.  Here was two men that had offered us nice wine and now expected us to at least talk to them.  I basically told Kat to hurry up and drink the wine so we could say a quick word with them and then get the hell out of there!  Kat didn't want to gulp the wine, figuring that would be even more rude.  Eventually, we started to talk to them while we were all still seated.  He asked if we were here on business and when I replied in the negative, he said "Yes, you two look too romantic for business."  The older man was doing all the talking and when he informed me that his companion was visiting from Norway, I just assumed that he couldn't speak English very well.  The older man then complemented Kat on her looks and said something about us being an attractive couple.  Kat and were both obviously nervous and annoyed, but we were still stuck talking.  The man finally said something about his wife and then started babbling.  I couldn't understand a word he was saying and Katherine was having trouble hearing, so we basically turned back to our table to finish the wine and escape.  After drinking the last drop, we got up to leave and I approached the man to at least shake his hand.  After shaking, he gently held on to my hand and placed his other hand on my upper arm, basically trapping me there.  He asked if we enjoyed the wine, if we would like to sit down and have another glass.  I told him we had to leave and we basically fled.  At this point, I heard his companion speak and he said something in accent-free English.  He understood the language, he was just being quiet because he was obviously embarrassed by what was going on!  Kat was, understandbly, a bit disturbed by the whole situation.  Ugh.

      Speaking of cars, I totally forgot to say that I officially own the Camaro now!  I took a few  urlLink crappy pictures ; I will try to get some better ones in the sun soon.  So far, I've only driven the car in the parking garage at work and a few blocks around my building.  I am still pretty horrible with the manual, but I'm getting better.  
Last night, Jeff and I took it out for a little spin.  Everything was going fine until I stopped at a stop sign and just couldn't seem to get the car going.  I kept stalling and stalling and stalling.  It felt very weird to me since I was giving it a ton of gas, it just didn't seem like enough.  After about 12 tries I finally got the car going!  It still seemed to be acting up because the revs were so low.  I stopped at the next stop sign and had the same issue!  Finally Jeff hopped in, played with the shifter and turns out, I was in third gear!  I'm just surprised that I actually got it to go that one time.  Oh well, Jeff said the shifter is fairly narrow and thus it's hard to tell which gear you are in.  I just think I am dumb and that is one more thing I will pay attention to when driving stick.

      The more I read about the Pontiac Solstice, the more I like it.  Take  urlLink this article  from Autoweek.  They get to test drive a few engineering mules and were quite impressed.  If the car is impressive in 85% complete form and Lutz is driving this home as the most important GM project, the final result is going to be amazing.  
UPDATE:  The car may only have 170 HP, but it also have 170 lb-ft in comparison to the 142 HP and 125 lb-ft found in a base Miata.   Even the new Mazdaspeed version only has 178 hp and 166 lb-ft.

      While Jeff and I were at the movies tonight, a lady dropped a large handful of change while at the consession stand.  It was at least 50 coins, so I immediately bent down to help her pick it up.  She was a bit older, so she let me pick it all up.  Her husband must have been at the bathroom, because he showed up just as I finished.  They both thanked me and started to walk off.  Just then, I got a good look at her husband.  Turns out, it was Lenny Wilkins!  Quote from NBA.com about  urlLink Lenny :  "Lenny and his wife Marilyn have three children, Leesha, Randy and Jaime, and two grandchildren, Ashley and Nicole. They make their off-season home in Seattle."  Pretty cool.

      My take on GMail.  
Ok, I've only been using it for a short while, but I haven't quite gotten the hang of it yet.  The first issue is that all email is sorted by "conversations", which is basically what everyone but Microsoft and GMail call threads.  For those of you that don't know what that means, a thread/conversation is just what it sounds like, a collection of email messages relating to a specific topic.  On the most basic level, a conversation is an original message and any replies to that message.  Certain mail clients assign a thread ID and thus you can change the message subject and it will still be a part of the original thread/conversation.  Either GMail or Yahoo doesn't support thread ID because I changed the subject on a thread and GMail started a new "conversation".  

There are a ton of keyboard shortcuts, which is interesting for a webmail client.  Seeing as I used pine for my email for 6 years, I'm quite used to navigating my email with a keyboard...  in pine!  Using it in gmail isn't as easy as I expected.  There are keyboard shortcuts for navigating various messages and conversations, but very basic actions, like cancelling the composition of a message, has to be done by mouse.  I do love that the keyboard shortcut for reporting spam is the excalamation key...  it just goes so well with most spam: "Ge.t a m.a$siv3 mem.b3r! buttercup obtuse bingo cxoiuqweijfd4klhjd7"  My natural response is "!".  

GMail has a concept of "All mail" and "archive".  The main action for all emails is to "archive" it.  It doesn't place the message in the trash, it doesn't move it to a specific folder, it just moves the email out of your inbox.  The only way to view archived mails is to use the All Mail view.  All Mail shows any mail in your inbox, your sent mail "folder" and anything you have archived.  It does not show any spam or trash emails.  

Instead of supporting folders like most email clients (web or desktop), GMail has introduced the concept of "Labels".  Well, I shouldn't say introduced, but this is the first time I've seen it in relation to an email client.  Instead of storing a conversation (see above) in various default or unique folders, you can assign one or more labels to the conversation.  Let's say that you wanted to save all conversations from a specific person in a specific folder and you wanted to save all conversations about a specific topic in a specific folder, what happens if your specifics collide?  Do you try to decide which folder takes presidence?  With labels, you can give the conversation labels for both the sender and the topic.  Like most folder views, there is a list of labels so you can jump to the list of all conversations with a specific label.  

GMail also supports filters which works hand in hand with labels.  You can filter on sender, receiver, subject, words in the body and words missing from the body.  The actions you can take are skip inbox (meaning it places the mail into the archive (see above)), apply a specific label or move it directly to the trash.  You cannot mark anything as spam through the filter.

One little feature that I saw in their help files but they did not actually implement related to attachments.  Instead of showing the common and generic paper clip icon to denote an attachment, GMail would use an icon to represent the file type of the attachment.  If it was a PDF, the common PDF icon would be used, etc.  I tested this out, and it's just a paper clip.  Shucky darn.  

Overall, I'm sure that I will get used to conversation view, labels and archive and be very happy with my free 1000 MB webmail client harnessing Google!

      Do you want to try out GMail?  Since GMail is still in a test period, acceptance is by invitation only.  I received my invitation through Blogger, but now that I am a user I can invite two more people!  The first two to contact me get dibs.  (Note:  If you ask via email, I only check once a day and thus it would be faster to txt/IM/call me.  If you email me right away yet I get two phone calls after your email was sent, you ain't getting GMail from me.)

      Wow, some guys just have it rough.  For whatever reason, 107.7 The End in Seattle took Andy Savage off their morning show.  I could probably look it up, but I really don't have the patience right now.  For a couple months after that, they would play hour-long themed blocks of music:  80s punk, new wave, grunge, etc.  Finally, they brought in Marconi and Tiny for the morning program.  About a month after that, The End changed formats and  dropped  them.  Sucks!  
At the time, they were on two radio stations, The End and a station in "Porkland" (their infantile name for Portland).  Well, looks like they got  urlLink booted from Portland  as well for joking about the Berg beheading.  D'oh!

      Angry Cell Phone Customer Trashes Verizon Store 
POSTED: 11:43 a.m. EDT May 14, 2004  

FARGO, N.D. -- A man who said he was fed up with his cellular phone service went to a Fargo mall and started hurling phones across a store, striking an employee and causing more than $2,000 in damage, authorities said.   

Jason Perala, 22, of Fargo, told The Forum newspaper that he planned only to yell at employees at Verizon Wireless.   

"Then I just lost it," he said. "I just started grabbing computers and phones and throwing them. I just destroyed the place. ... I kind of regret that I did it, but I hope my message got across." 
   
Police said Perala took off his shirt and put on safety glasses before throwing around computers, phones and other items.   

One employee was struck in the shoulder by a phone before he and other workers dashed into an office, locked the door and called police, Sgt. Kevin Volrath said. Other businesses in the West Acres mall lowered their steel security gates during Thursday's incident.   

Perala was arrested without incident and jailed on charges of felony criminal mischief and misdemeanor simple assault.

       urlLink Karamazov : "He also discusses his belief that men only practice love for their fellow man out of a belief in God and the immortality of their soul. If they did not believe, Ivan says, than there would exist no incentive or reason for them to practice love and kindness. If they do not believe, then the only motive for action would logically be self-interest. "  
Is that a truism?  Do you believe that, in a mentality lacking love and kindness, the only logical conclusion would be that all actions would be driven by self-interest?  The implication here is that self-interest is inherently a negative characteristic.  Is it not possible that, while looking out for yourself, you can also look out for others?  The man that helps and cares for others may draw greater fortune to himself.  By looking out for others, you are in a way looking out for yourself?  
Honestly, there is very little that I do that does not benefit myself in some way.  I doubt there have been more than two cases in the past five years where I have done something that I did not think would ultimately benefit myself.  If I make a sacrifice at work to help someone out, I believe that this action will be remembered and either they would help me out or I would gain better standing in their mind.  If I was to perform community service, it would partially be because I could talk about it later and have others think highly of me.  I'm selfish, but sometimes it benefits others.

      Gah, I can't believe I forgot to post this earlier!  So, on Monday, I had a cashier ask me about my age.  Well, it happened again on Thursday!  I was going to Sports Authority to buy an ankle brace for Kat when it happened.  I picked out the brace and headed to the first available cashier.  I paid with a credit card and had to use one of the electronic signature readers.  She told me to keep my card out for signature validation so I also pulled out my drivers license.  My signature never looks right on this electronic devices so I did it just in case.  I guess the cashier looked at my birthdate because when she handed my cards back to me:  

"Are you 23, 24?" 
"23, why, do I seem older, younger?" 
"More mature." 
"Any reason?" 
I'm 21 and guys our age seem younger.  You dress well, like you made it somewhere, you seem established."  

The funny thing is, I was wearing a long-sleeve jersey material shirt (Kenneth Cole, but she couldn't tell that), Gap slacks and black Puma sneakers!  I definitely wasn't sporting "mature" looking attire.  Oh well.

      My brain is triggered to wake up if I hear a diesel engine idling outside of my window.  Why?  Well, back in senior year, I was sharing a parking permit with a roommate.  I was almost towed twice for parking in my apartment lot without the permit but I heard the idling tow truck and woke up!  Anyway, there was a truck idling outside of my apartment this morning around 7 AM and thus I woke up.

      I really shouldn't be posting right now as I should be working on the SEVEN specifications I have to write in the next few weeks.  I'd tell you more, but then I'd have to make the internet sign an NDA and I just don't have time for the paperwork this week.  
Anyway, during the daily Jeff-and-Mike lunch extravaganza, something a bit humorous happened.  Jeff and I have a pretty set list of restaurants we go to (Quizno's, Qdoba, Chipotle, Ribeye, Nasai Teriyaki, Red Robin, Matt's Famous, Arby's, Taj Palace, Yen Ching, etc) and some of the places have started to remember us.  Today at one of the usuals, my order number was 29.  The cashier said "29, close to 30...   are you over 30?".  I had remembered from a previous conversation that she said she had been out of school for 10 years and just got her degree last year so I assumed she was about 30 though she looked not a day over 21.  My response was "No, a bit lower", giving her a thumbs down motion.  
"29?" 
"No." 
"27?" 
"Nope, lower." 
At this point, she just looked at me, scared to give another incorrect answer.  I held up two fingers, said "23" and transitioned to three fingers.  She was quite flabergasted and made some commented about how I looked so much older while she looked so much younger saying that people don't think of her as a day older than 20, 19 even!  
Funny stuff.

      Haha, I'm a tool.  Just today, Kat and I went to Big Apple Bagels to grab a quick lunch before we both headed off to work (yes, working on a Saturday).  I ordered my usual, a Roma Italian sub and a 32oz Diet Coke.  We were both a bit tired today but I believe I was the one with worse coordiation.  While reaching for my drink, I slightly nudged it.  Thinking I was about to knock it off the table, I made a quick grab for it, hoping to save it.  Instead, I increased the drinks velocity and redirected its destination vector directly toward Kat.  Needless to say, I absolutely drenched her in 32oz of Diet Coke.  Thankfully, she wasn't too upset.  I tried to clean up as best I could, but she was basically covered and nothing could be done.  We quickly finished our meal outside and then went home.  Minus 50 points for me (for the obvious) and plus 50 points for her (or not freaking out).

      Hmm, power to weight ratios, one of the most important aspects of any car.  The Focus only has 130 HP but it only weighs 2551 pounds and has 135 ft-lbs.  The Camaro, on the other hand has only 140 HP and weighs 3103 pounds but has 180 ft-lbs.  A few calculations later give 19.62 pounds-per-HP and 18.90 pounds-per-ft-lb for the Focus and 22.16 pounds-per-HP and 17.24 pounds-per-ft-lb for the Camaro.  The Focus is faster than the Camaro but the Camaro has better low-end acceleration?  Weird.

      Nothing quite like slogging through an array of websites to find out the recommended fuel for your new crappy car.  Considering that the car was produced in 1992, trying to find information about it online is interesting.  Most of the sites that have info are either all-encompasing sites that cover a certain aspect of all cars (safety info, for example), or they are some enthusiast site just for that car or type of car (thus a third generation Camaro).  I finally found that my base V6 engine only requires regular unleaded fuel.  I know the Chevy used to have a 4-cyl Camaro and that would obviously take regular so I figured it was possible that the V6 was mapped for midgrade (89 octane).  Nope, just 87 octane.

Religion is just a meme in the minds of many.  The mind is comprised of a collection of neurons with some capabiilty of memory and higher processing.  The neurons are a physical entity that is controlled by chemicals and electrical pulses.  Viruses can have an affect on chemicals and chemical processes.  Why can't someone just create a virus to destroy religion?  Would it really be that hard?  Please?

      As a kid, I absolutely hated a warm pillow.  I would have difficulty falling asleep because by the time I had rested enough to almost fall asleep, the heat of my pillow would annoy me and wake me up.  I would either flip the pillow or sleep on the other end.  In other words, the average pillow had four sectors.  By the time I was done with all four, the original sector had probably cooled down to normal and I could switch to it.  I remember being awake for at least an extra hour some nights because of this.  
I no longer have this problem, otherwise I would run out and buy the  urlLink Chillow !  A small, flat but otherwise pillow-shaped insert, the Chillow acts as a heatsink and radiator.  It makes one side cold and one side a bit warm.  The warmth is absorbed by the pillow proper and dissipated leaving the surface nice and chilly.  Hell, I might buy one anyway!

      Car update:  I'm getting better at the manual seeing as I haven't stalled yet today (a first!).  I've had some compliments including about the exhaust note.  I'm happy.  I'm really started to get used to the upgraded audio.  The bass response is pretty cool and there is a fairly slick steering column (not steering wheel) based audio controller.  I will probably take a picture of it when I do a full photoshoot later.  Basically, it is stalk sticking out from the lower left area of the steering column.  It has a two-way switch for station seeking (while in radio mode) and track seeking (for CD mode), two buttons for volume control and a single button for mode which will switch between presets for radio mode and will switch CDs for CD mode.  I'm getting used to using it.

      Yesterday was my one year anniversary at Microsoft!  Following standard procedure, I brought in a pound of M&Ms.  Against standard procedure, I actually brought in a pound of M&Ms in three different flavors (plain, peanut and crispy (which is crispy in the sense of Nestle Crunch bars: crisped rice)).  It feels fairly odd that I've already been here for a year.  I've done so much, but it also seems like I could have accomplished more.  I shouldn't really complain, there are others that started around the same time I did that haven't done much at all.  
There are actually a few people that have started recently (one started two years ago and two others started a year ago) that are leaving the company.  One is getting married, another is going to school and another is starting a company.  It should be publicly known, but Microsoft is reducing their benefits.  It just looks like there isn't enough to keep people around anymore.

      Jeff took a look at my comparison post and asked about the units for the slalom course.  I knew it was MPH but Jeff reasoned that time through the course might be a better value to track.  I figured that average speed was used because different cars will have different acceleration rates, times through the course, speeds and more.  Just using time might be a better indication of cornering ability and power, not just cornering ability.  Anyway, I found this in one of my Motor Trend articles:  
Just drive around the cones as fast as your can, right?  Yes-and no.  Try cracking off six perfect, consecutive, emergency lane-changes at freeway speeds (some well above) with a margin of error at less than one inch.  Sure, this sound challenging until one realizes each cone arrives at less than a one second interval-the whole thing takes less than six seconds in these vehicles.  This is one test that best reveals a car's evil side.  A propensity to push, get loose, or even spin is ever more apparent while all four ties are howling at, in some cases, 80 MPH.  That's right, the speeds listed above are timed averages between the entry and exit markers along the 600-foot course-not how fast the car is actually traveling along its curvy line, which is, in fact, much faster.

      As you can tell from my last post, I have a new car!  Well, almost new.  Let me tell the story.  
About this time last year, I was car shopping.  I had almost signed on an Evo when better judgment told me to go with something cheaper to start.  Also, 271 HP is a bit much for someone that had never driven a manual before.  I decided to use my grandfathers Ford discount and just pick up a Focus.  It had decent looks and handling and the interior was fairly accomodating.  I have yet to find nicer seats (not even in the SVT).  While I was trying to pick out the Focus I wanted, the sales person I was working with kept mentioning the SVT.  When we finally went out to the dealer lot to grab an automatic ZX3 for a test drive, we had to pass over at least five SVTs to find a single ZX3.  Obviously the cars were not selling well.  
I bought the Camaro about two months ago and I've only put about 200 miles on it.  I wasn't getting any better at the manual, so I just stopped trying.  I'm always looking at car forums when the SVT was mentioned.  I cannot remember the context but someone was praising it on a Subaru forum.  A car has to be at least moderately respectable for someone entrenched in another manufacturer's camp to praise it.  Just on a whim, I decided to look up new/used SVTs in the area.  The only one I could find was a 2004 model with about 940 miles on it.  I figured that had to be a typo for 9,400 so I figured I'd email the dealer.  Nope, not a typo.  An older gentleman traded in a SVT Lightning for an SVT Focus and then decided it seemed too young for him.  He returned it 3 weeks later.  
They gave me an overnight test drive and I decided this is what my car should have been all along.  Tighter (but not punishing) suspension, better brakes, better looks, better acceleration and an amazing transmission.  Going to this car from the Camaro is very eye-opening.  The Getrag trans is just a thing of beauty.  I think the only better transmission out there for under $35k is in the S2000.  The dealership first put the car on the market at $19,995 (or just about what the car cost new) and that didn't fly.  The salesperson also offered me only $7,500 for the ZX3 and an interest rate of 7.49%.  Given those numbers, my monthly payment would have been $677.17!  The price of the car was talked down to $17,500 then $16,900 and finally $16,500.  The trade in on the ZX3 was brought up to $7,750 then $8,000 then $8,500.  The APR was brought down to 6.49%.  After the trade-in, loan payoff (of the ZX3), license, document fees (yeah WTF), taxes and $1,000 down, I had to finance $17,238.75.  With an APR of 6.49%, my monthly payment will only be $528.27.  
The more I drive this car, the more I love it.  I am not quite used to the 6-speed but I've had multiple people tell me I'm much smoother in the SVT than in the Camaro.  That is just a put-down in disguise but I'll take it anyway!

      Ok, now that I have a semi-respectible car, I'm thinking about taking it autocrossing.  Let me explain in case you have never heard of autocrossing.  Basically, a tight and twisty course is constructed of cones in a large parking lot.  You rarely go over 60 MPH so this is not a high speed sport.  It focuses on cornering and smooth driving.  I'm definitely not good enough with the manual to consider doing it this year but I plan on checking out a few events so that I know what to expect next summer.  Anyway, check out some of these  urlLink course maps  and you'll get a better idea.

 Kat and I didn't do much this Fourth of July weekend.  We both had difficult weeks (especially the night where I left work at 12:45 AM and then was up for the next day before 7 AM) so we just took it easy.  Her parents backyard overlooks much of Seattle so we were able to see four different fireworks displays at once (Elliot Bay, Gasworks, Yarrow Bay and Kirkland).
 Tonight was the second game of the summer FloorBurn season.  I'm captain already and I've already made a mistake.  I didn't inform everyone we had a game this week (assuming that the manager would take care of that like last season) and only 4 people showed up.  A couple people subbed for us and we ended up winning 3-1!  I almost had a hat trick but the pass I got right in front of the goal was actually about to go into the goal so I just let it go by!
 I've spent about eight hours working on my yearly review for Microsoft and I'm only about a third of the way completed.  It is important but not that important.  I just want a fatty raise so I can afford my new car and my $1,570/month rent.
 This happened two weekends ago, but Eric of Jenn&Eric fame was in town so Kat, Eric and I grabbed some dinner and dessert.  We had a good time, but it didn't last long enough.  I had an early morning appointment so I had to call the night around 9 PM.
 The new car is still super sweet.  To measure how sweet it is, I picked up a  urlLink G-Tech Performance Meter Pro .  I haven't had a chance to try it out yet.  Well, I haven't had a piece of flat, dry, non-cop-infested road to really wring out the car and measure with it yet.  In time.
 While the car is still super sweet, the oh-so-smooth shifter is becoming less smooth.  There is some hesitation as the shifter returns to neutral on the way to the next gear.  It almost seems like the linkage is jammed.  Oh well, it should work itself out in time otherwise it is going to the dealer!  I didn't drive this car hard at all yet and I haven't had a gear grind nor have I missed a shift.  If there is a problem, it wasn't my fault.
 I've been playing a ton of GT3 lately, now that Russ has moved out.  I can play the really long races or long sets of races and just leave the PS2 running while I go to work.  I can play a bit, do something else then go back to an unmolested PS2.  I've already won an F1 car so now it's basically a game of "How many times can I pass everyone before I win!".  I love that game.

      Now that I have the SVT Focus, I've put the Camaro up for sale.  I have so far only posted it in the Microsoft classifieds but anyone in the Puget Sound area can take a look at these.  I put the car up two weeks ago and I got a phone call last Wednesday:  
Her: I'm calling about the Camaro. 
Me:  Ok, it's still available. 
Her: Can I come see it? 
Me:  Sure, when works for you. 
Her: How about this weekend? 
Me:  Ok, when? 
Her: Oh, I don't know, lunchtime?  
At this point, I got a little bit frustrated.  I dont want to hear "lunchtime", I want a specific time and date.  Anyway, I finally got her to decide on Saturday at noon.  She calls me Friday morning (a call I missed since I was in the parking garage) and says that she can't do it on Saturday and that Sunday at 5 PM would work better.  Ok, that is fine.  I get a voicemail Sunday at roughly 4 PM to say she can't make it at 5 PM and would Monday work.   I call her back, no answer, so I left a voicemail saying that Monday would be fine if she would please tell me a specific time.   She emails me this morning to say that either 6 or 7 PM would work.  I told her to give me a specific time and if she was going to change that time to tell me by 2 PM.  She writes back, saying 7 PM would be fine.   Here we are, 5:30 PM and she calls:  
Her: Hi Mike, I just wanted to see if we could meet earlier. 
Me:  Well, we decided on 7 PM. 
Her: I know, but I was wondering if we could meet at 6 or 6:30 PM. 
Me:  I already said that I would need to know by 2 PM if you were going to change the time. 
Her: I know, I was just wondering if you could get off work early. 
Me:  No, but 7 PM works for me. 
Her: Ok. 
Me:  (Cutting her off) Bye.  ::CLICK:: 
Holy cow.  I bet you $100 that she is going to show up 15 minutes late and then not know how to drive a manual transmission.  Just wait. 
UPDATE:  She can't drive a manual!   But, this is a car for her (I think) younger brother so I will give her a little slack.

      Sigh, I hate moving.  Russ gave me not quite enough notice to find a roommate so I'm moving out.  I even paid the entire rent plus the month-to-month penalty plus the extra parking spot for a month hoping I would find someone.  No such luck.  
Katherine has graciously offered living with her for a short while until I find someone else to room with.  I am going to move the majority of my stuff into a storage unit and move the necessities over to her townhome.  Actually, I've already moved most of my hanged clothes and shoes.  Over the weekend, I hope to pack up everything so that I can get a mover next week to bring it all to a storage unit.  No way am I going to try to move my couch, queen bed, bookshelves et cetera by myself.  
The real kicker here is that I didn't give my apartment enough notice that I was leaving.  When I went from the year lease to a month-to-month lease, they never said anything about a "twenty day notice".  On a month-to-month, that's a huge amount of notice!  I wanted to move out at the end of July but they are so graciously allowing me to pay $1470 for all of August.  They said that if someone moves into the apartment, they will pro-rate the amount and pay me back.  I somehow doubt that is going to happen!  Sigh.

      Ok, really weird dream.  Here are some of the highlights:
 
 Set in a time where USA and the Soviet Union are at a full-on war.
 The first part of the dream sees me running across an American battlefield, trying to avoid bullets, mines, bombs, missiles and just about every other type of munition.
 I saw a very large passenger jet, presumably American, get hit by a missle and then crash into the sea.  This jet was filled with Olympic athletes.
 At this point, the dream becomes more of a movie and I am delegated to observer status.
 A rag-tag group of Americans decide that the only way to stop the Soviet Union is to infiltrate their country and kill their leader.  The group of Americans consist of a female Olympic judge, a 12-year-old girl and an older guy that looks like James Earl Jones.
 This group has to train to be able to infiltrate the country.  Instead of learning military techniques, they learn how to train water snakes.
 I don't remember how, but all of a sudden the entire group is in the heart of the Soviet Union.  The unnamed leader is hiding out in a rural town in a boarding house.
 The little girl sneaks upstairs, undetected, to find the leader sleeping amongst 15 other people from the town. The girl places a rag of some sort of chemical over the leaders mouth, knocking him out.  Instead of just killing him, the girl saws off his head with a dull machete and puts it into a burlap bag.  No one has yet noticed anything has happened.  She sneaks downstairs and runs outside.
 Just as she joins the rest of her group hiding behind a bush outside, there is a sound much like the sharpening of a machete.  From an open window upstairs, the now-dead body of the leader with a ghostly head starts to appear in the window.  At first, it's safe to assume he is about to brandish a machete when instead he pulls out a .50 cal machine gun (the type that is normally truck mounted).  Before he can fire, the James Earl Jones character grabs a gun from the ground and sprays the leader with bullets.
 The end.
