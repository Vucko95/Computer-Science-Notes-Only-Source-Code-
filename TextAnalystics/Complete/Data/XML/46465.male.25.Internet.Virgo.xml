      Okay, this is my first entry of what is going to be the most exciting travel blog in the whole WORLD! Why? Because I am writing it and I promise that I will have many exciting,breathtaking,neardeath,mindboggling adventures that will make you sit on the edge of your seat and read through the small spaces between your fingers as you cover your face in terror! but then you will wipe your eyes from laughing so hard and breath a sigh of relief because there will always be a happy ending (damn I hope so)...But for now I am going to bore you to death with paperwork, paperwork, and more paperwork... so, I am  officially   an  invitee , and for non-peace corps people let me explain what that means. When you apply for Peace Corps you have to go through 5 steps til you become a volunteer...I am on step 3.  I am filling out visa applications, peace corps passport applications, life insurance (in case I die out there in field), loan deferment papers, resumes, aspiration statements, and packing at the same time...So I am keeping myself fairly busy...As the date for departure nears...(scary) On a sidenote I had a really cool dream in which Mick Jagger made an appearance and I got to talk to him about the album Sticky Fingers (my personal fave) over dinner...I woke up feeling like a close friend of Mick's and I had to remind myself that it was all just a dream (sniff) oh and ill probably bore you to tears as I recount my dreams which I am very fond of doing!  That's about it for now, don't forget to check in once in awhile...But I wont be leaving until Aug. 6th. Peace OUt

      Last night mi madre cooked the best cheese enchiladas ever! Man, am I going to miss her cooking! If I were Ryan or David (take this advice if you guys are listening) I would be calling every night to find out what's for dinner and then invite myself over! But i'm quite the self-inviting guest and always on the look-out for a free meal! free food rocks! especially fridays at costco! anways...back to dinner last night! My family has the best conversations ever! There is nothing like verbal exchanges over yummy food in my household! I think i'm going to miss that the most! Adios...y hasta manana!

        Ohmigod ....I'm leaving  next friday !!!! What am&nbsp; I doing? Not only am I leaving everyone and everything I've ever known behind...I also have to get my butt from the Philly airport to the Holiday Inn! Oh man, I can already see...me wondering around the airport with my gigantazoid bags looking like a total freak, trying to figure out where the heck i'm supposed to go...back and forth and back and forth from one side of the aiport to the other...I get nauseus just thinking about boarding the plane to Philly... IM SCARED!!  Or I'm really excited to the point of barfing...but I have heard that a lot of musicians and performers barf in the bathroom before getting on stage...    &nbsp;  So,  while on the subject of barf...Dara is coming into town today!  Hehe, jk...well about the barf=dara thing...She really is coming. We are picking her up at 2:40 as long as the crappy Houston weather holds out and allows her plane to land. Tonight we are going to a play called "Dial M for Murder" but tomorrow....tomorrow i love ya! tomorrow, you're only a day away! Sorry, typing that word may me break into the Annie song...but back on topic...tomorrow almost the entire fam is going on an airboat ride through the swamp and wrastlin' with the 'gators...good ol' family fun! yeah,  i've got the coolest family ever!      &nbsp;  Oooh ooh how could I forget!!! I got my new ibook mac laptop today, that my g-parents were so generous to bestow upon me! Ohmigod...it is the most beautiful little peace of hardware ever! It looks like a little white flying saucer! It's stylish and useful! I loooooooooooove it! I slept with it last night and it is even quite the cuddly bear...jk!     &nbsp;  Hmm...that's about it for now...yes..yes it is...Tootles!

      So i passed out fairly intoxicated last night and forgot the all=too-important pre-prepassout water binge! All night i dreamt that i was searching for things to drink and drinking everything i could get my hands on to quench my thirst...but nothing i drank did it for me! funny!

      So I left Sacramento on the 17th, very sad but strange too because i feel like im on vacation and i'll be heading back soon to see everyone! REBECKA &amp; JAMIE I MISS YOU GUYS! Orange County was fun...i got lotsa sun and my face is a nice shade of tomatoe red! I got to say goodby to my grandparents and Jenn which was nice, but sad too. Im still trying to grasp the concept that ill be gone for 2 years...but knowing me i'll probably realize it as i get on that plane for philly and leave my mommy and then it will hit me and ill barf all over the person in front of me!  So...I got on the plane at 6:40 am on the 22nd and flew to Houston. It was a long ass flight and it sucked. I sat next to this old guy whose shirt kept touching my arm and it really bothered me for some reason. I hate flying and i need some really strong narcotic for the plane ride to Sofia or else...im um...going to be very uncomfortable. especially if the shirt of the person next to me touches my arm!  Well I got to houston yesterday around the 3pm and then went out for some margarita's and drank too much...suddenly at 1am i awoke to find myself on the couch with mavis sleeping on my stomach (that's my cat), drenched in my own drool, and a lifetime movie on the boobtoob...god i hope that's not a vision of my future! so pathetic! anywho...that's all for now! I LOVE AND MISS EVERYBODY WHO IS READING THIS!

      Today I went and saw Faranheit 9/11 all by myself. It has been a long time since I went to the movies by myself and it was quite enjoyable. The movie was amazing!!! It is an emotional rollercoaster and really makes you think and question the world around you...and shows how immoral goverenment is and how so many people are blinded by the almighty dollar...including myself...but i guess the first step is admiting you are an addict, right? It all reminded me of this conversation I had with Shannon about emotion and how emotion controls reason...and then from there I realized that governement and corporations function on reason alone...scary. Michael Moore illustrates that point when he tries to get congressmen to enlist their own children to fight the war in Iraq. It's easy to send other people's kids over to fight a war... Man, it really sucks realizing how messed up the world is and how sad it is that all this people in government, congressman, senators, the cabinet, they were all young once and idealistic and knew what was right and what was wrong and then as they grew older they realized that some things were not so wrong and it didnt matter if they ignored certain facts in the pursuit of something they desired...I mean, everyone thinks their a good person. I'm sure Ken Lay from Enron thinks he's a good person, but he has committed so much evil and hurt some many people and ruined so many people's lives! It's scary! How do you reach that point where you're no longer a good person and not realize it? How do they(Halliburton and others) lie to themselves and convince themselves that sending kids to die for the sake of new business contracts and potential finanial gain in Iraq? How can they look in the mirror? I just hope that when I'm old I don't decide that my ethics and morals can be ignored for the sake of a profit or anything for that fact. That I will always stand by my principles and beliefs. I hope that when im old i wont become disillusioned or realistic...because if realistic means ignoring my heart and killing my empathy for other then forget it! I guess I am a tree hugging, peace preaching hippy...because in the long wrong what's wrong with that? At least I wont kill innocent people to attain what i believe in. And that's that.

      My sister is leaving me! Now I dont have anyone to play with, no one to punch while we're driving in the car, no one sneak around the house and try to scare, no one to make fun of, no one to play TYB with, and no one to blow on...! I'm soooooo sad! This sucks...I hate leaving everyone behind...is the Peace Corps really worth it??? I'm starting to have my doubts...I'm getting more and more scared as the date approaches...it's Aug.2nd and I leave on the 6th...It's getting a little too real for me...yuck! I'm getting that barfy feeling just thinking about it! Well, Dara Lou Lou Head, I had a great time with you here...even though you hog the bed and practically push me off the side...at least you didnt try and cuddle with me! Man, this sucks! I'm really going to be sad when we drop you off at the airport! (she's upstairs performing her hour and a half daily prep routine as i type) I can't wait til she and jamie come to Bulgaria and visit me! Or everyone else who has said they are going to visit me! (My mom &amp; Ray, jen and shannon, and Loren) If I left anyone out youre gonna have to remind me! anyways...i better get going, i've got to brush my teeth...they're feeling a tad furry...like i could make yarn out of the hair and knit a sweater with it...mmm...pretty! well..that's all for now!

      After an exotic meal of macaroni &amp; cheese, fried alligator, fried okra, fried everything, and frozen cool whip for dessert...we made it to the Super Gator Airboat Rides famous for their super GIANT gators! As we stepped out of the car and began spraying OFF on each other, we were kindly informed by the airboat captain, "There aint no 'skeeters here". We ventured down to the water through a quaint waterfront trailer park village. As the adults fought over the front seat, Dara, Ryan, and I settled into the back. I made Ryan switch seats with me so I could be by the edge. Except for the intense sun beating down on us and exruciatingly oppressive humidity...it all felt strangely like a Disneyland Ride, a down home version of the Jungle Boat Cruise. VROOM!!! The Airboat Ride begins...we cruise at a windy 5mph past stinky dead turtles and movie sets of swamp people houses...oh wait they werent movie sets! As we sat anticipating the rumored SUPER 12foot monster alligators, we saw something in the distance...barreling down the river towards our boat, straight towards my mom in fact, with it's mouth wide open...was a surly 3 foot 'gator pissed that he cant get anymore marshmallows! As he cruised along my side of the boat and i peered over the side at him, i was informed this one's name was "JUmper" ! I quickly leaned back into the boat and used the zoom on my camera to take a nice picture. We were warned to put in our earplugs or have our eardrums blasted to oblivion because the Captain was crankin up the airboat and we were really going to cruise now! I heeded his advice, Dara didnt and now she must learn sign language. Finally! We were going at least 25mph through giant lilly pads...and past a cute louisiana fisherman... As we passed through clumps of giant water lillys that grew past our heads, the boat stopped and we were stuck...haha i guess that was a little of the Louisiana swamp humor...not very funny when it is hot as hell and the humidity is so thick that Dara's hair is floating over hear head like she's underwater. He handed us Giant Lilly Pads to wear on our heads a sun hat...and as an old lady reached for mine, I ripped it away from her hands and put it on my head...I wanted to wear lilly pad on my head dammit! Well, that was all fun and we finally headed back for dock. When we got there and exited the boat, my mom exclaimed "Wow! What a fabulous boat ride!" and then forced us (me, dara, ryan, and david) to stand arround in the intense heat while the asked the captain a million and one questions. Finally, when they were satisfied...we all piled back into the cars and headed over the Louisiana border for a quick tour of Sulpher, LA...about as beautiful as it's name. I even saw a kid that looked like popeye...and that was that. We made it back to Houston, Tx and I couldn't help but breath a sigh of relief as we reach civilization. I saw "The Village" last night and it rocked! Go see it...I screamed and held onto Dara for dear life throughout the movie! I've got to go because now we are headed to the Galleria. THe 2nd largest mall in the US complete with a hotel and ice skating rink! Lates!
