      so strange... Watching probably the only child i will ever have being tossed from home to home.. Glad to see no one else seems to give a shit.  After all why should i?  Maybe because in the lowest time in my life she seemed to be the only thing worth living for.  Guess no one but me will understand just how special a dumb dog can be.  I am so out of control about the whole situation.  I think that's the part that kills me

      in the midst of the black hole in cyberspace, somewhere you loose hope that there are any decent people still in existance.  From somewhere out of the darkness one hand reaches out. Somehow you know this hand is ok.   No matter how fast your world turns upside down by people that u thought were friends, you hold on to this one hand.    No matter how hard you try to hold someone elses hand they seem to loose thier grip.  I think I am a lucky one I not only found one person to hold on to but 2 more that held on to me.  Greg, Kym, Chris thanks guys!! you're the best!

      Strange memories fumble abross my keyboard tonight. Memories of lost online loves.  Some I miss some I don't.  Some still flicker on the screen.  Some seem to say things as I was thinking them.  Some I've met.  Some I still love (Laura).  Others I won't mention.  I learned from them all and I am NOT going to be played again.    My one thought is just remember when you talk to someone online remember they are a living and breathing person with a heart and mind and feelings.    Shallow people suck ass!

      What a night... Ever have one of those nights where u just wanna crawl in your bed and stay there and hope to god the sun doesn't come up the next day???  Ever feel like you stepped on someone's toes and didn't even know you were stepping on them.... Ever feel like you really knew someone that you never met then u find out that you didn't know them at all??? Ever feel like you are being kept from knowing secrets that you can't believe were never told??? Ever think that jealousy is such a waste of time???  Ever think that your hard work will go on forever as unnoticed???  Ever wonder how you get so attached to people you NEVER meet??? Such a strange online world we live in!

        Tomorrow    Tomorrow will be soon enough, so many of us say. But why put off until tomorrow, what we can do today! We could give so much more Help, to those that are in need. Put words of Jesus in their hearts that unsaved souls be freed. Yes, we know we should be doing this and tomorrow we will start. Oh no, my friend, the time is now, Dear Lord please touch our hearts. Tomorrows seldom ever come when we put them off today. Let's ask the Lord to give us Strength to do tomorrows right away.  ~Robert D. Frost

      How is it you meet someone and you just instantly hit it off?  Sure just as friends first.  Always a cool thing.  Then you find yourself nekkid and cuddling after a short time.  It all seemed ok.  Strange how 2 strangers can find comfort somewhere where there shouldn't be comfort so soon.  Sharing stories like they've been friends forever.  Hanging out like there's nothing to it.  I know you're scared Don't be, I don't bite.   I won't change your life. It wouldn't be right.  Trust takes time so relax, don't fret it I'm just here Don't sweat it

      Snow Globe...    Sometimes I feel like I am in one of those snowball toys that you shake up and it snows.  Except in this one the people aren't glued down.  So you shake it up and see how stands up straight, and who falls over.    It always amazes me, who you think will stand up beside you every time, fall over.  Those who would usually fall stand up straight.    No matter how many times you shake the ball, different results happen.

      Yet another long blog…  Upcoming schedule:  Tonight finish up advertising stuff for .com booth at Computer Country Expo on Sunday.  Prolly end up over at Joyce’s for a pop or something.   Wednesday head over to farm and fleet go measure out the floor and put in an application and call Larry. Go on Mom’s puter and download evidence eliminator and burn it to cd.  Look through the advertiser. Go out to Gurnee and clean out a puter so I don’t have to pay for my booth.  Thursday make calls on jobs in the paper.  Spend the later afternoon with Arlynd.  Friday pack up Kel and Laura and head out to Michigan for a load of stuff.  Jeff is moving out so I need to go do this Friday. Stay as long as i can just to take in the change.  Saturday spend time with Arlynd and unpack.  Get ready for the expo.  Sunday is Expo day at the Gurnee Mills Holiday Inn.  I’m so nervous.  Hopefully between Jeff , Laura, Kel and Arlynd I’ll be ok.

      Well I promised an awesome blog so here it is…  Tuesday night:  Arlynd and I went to Joyce’s.  The girls were playing pool so we got on the other table and started shooting pool.  Gunner walked in about an hour later and started playing with us.  He’s like 6”8’ hen he plays pool he needs a whole lot of room to sprawl out.  Gloria was in his way. So he politely nudges her with his cue and she doesn’t move so he politely nudges her again.  She still doesn’t move. Now she was playing her game, but I knew the girl she was playing in all my years of pool I don’t think I have ever beat her and I know Gloria won’t.  So Gloria has about 3 shouts before she has to worry bout shooting again so I asked her “Gloria will you please move so we can shoot?” She moved.  After like an hour later, she comes up behind me and starts shaking her finger at me saying, “don’t you dare ever call my name again while I am shooting”.  My response was “whatever”.  By now I am REALLY drunk.  Arlynd and I went and sat at the bar.  Few minutes go by and I go pee.  All I hear from the bathroom up and over all the music and people was “you’re a fucking liar”  from Arlynd.  I walk out and I say “what can’t I leave you alone for 2 minutes so I can pee?”  He said, “she’s a liar, that’s not what happened..  Then proceeded to tell the whole story.  About an hour later, I go pee again. This time the door opens behind me about 10 seconds later.  It’s Gloria.  I figure I’m getting my ass kicked now.  So I figure out what my move’s gonna be and then the door opens again. Now I think it’s Bonnie gonna come kick my ass.  But much to my delighted surprise it’s the bartender Tammy making sure I was “ok”.  Larry Scott walks in after I had told Arlynd about my conversation with him the other night.  Larry’s name is stamped on the back part of his leather belt. Arlynd says, “Why does he have his name stamped on the back of his belt is that so his boyfriend knows who he is when he walks up behind him?”  I quickly get us out of there.  Was very hard for me to let him out of my site.  Thursday night ran in to Dennis McGary.  That was quite interesting.  Trish turned out to be a hottie, been a few years since I’ve seen her    Friday  My car doesn’t wanna cooperate as I am trying to sell it.  Find out it’s out of gas… Man I hate when that happens…   Saturday  Called Larry over at L and J.  He doesn’t know who Dave Steele is driving for so if any of you know, please call me or Larry.  He says he’s got a Lincoln short car sitting there and he’s giving away 3-4 runs a day.  So if all else fails I can probably hop in there and he was saying that he’s buying a brand new stretch.  So that’s a matter of time before he talks to Ralph and see what he has to say.    Tried to get a hold of Ronnie about buying my car.  That never happened.  So I started making alternate plans,  Ran out to Rollins auto with Mike and saw what he had out there.  Spent most of the day online car shopping.  Stopped over here at the house, met Bob and Andres was here.  Grabbed a meatloaf sandwich, hibernated in my room punching away at the keyboard.  Ran in to Scott online started talking about his van.  I figured that even if I have to take a depreciation value on my car, in the long run I would be better in a conversion van.  I’ve always wanted one.  Opportunity knocks.    Laura got a job in Aurora and Scott still has his job in Rolling Meadows.  Now they need 2 cars.  He has a van but he knows, with all that traveling, he will be eating himself out of house and home in the van.  Laura really doesn’t like to drive big vehicles, so she has her mini van.  Leaves Scott in the full sized van.  He needs something more economical and I need something Arlynd can have a little fun with.  Maybe I will be more valuable to him.  A straight up vehicle swap would be ideal for both parties.  I think I will just tell Ronnie to go see John and do the trade out.  I will feel better knowing I helped out Scott.  I am handing him my problems and he’s handing me his.  It all works out.  I think that I will contract Greg to come help me with the tune up and ask Mike to help me get the tire off the damn thing.  If he won’t do it I suppose I will ask Arlynd to do it.  Maybe Wednesday when Star goes out an we have the house to ourselves we will go down there first.  I got paged by Foxtrot tonight so he went down to Laura’s with me and met her, tried to get the tire off, did a spot check on the van with me.  Between the two of us we made the decision it was worth the trade.  About even out on the trade I think.  He told me hardly ever sees Brandy anymore.  He has custody of his 4 year old son.  Living at mom and dad’s.  Still working at Farm and  Fleet.  He’s going to fax me over an application tomorrow.  I’m going to fax him over a sales quote on 100,000 sq ft done every month with a once a year strip.  See what kind of deal I can get him.    Joyce called me tonight looking for Eric’s #.  The DJ was way late and she set it up thru Javier and was worried that they weren’t gonna show so I gave her the cell phone # I had and it seemed to work.  U’re welcome honey!  OK that brings ya up to date on life with me.  Oh ya and I ran in to Connie “Charlie’s Connie” and we are gonna go out for dinner or something one night.  I called ya back Jeff but no answer I paged ya with my pager # so when you get back page me.  I need ya to send me the quote sheet for truck stops.  Dave, thanks for the blow off I really do appreciate it.  Really I do.  I hope whatever it was you had fun doing it.  Bill I called ya when I got back from Laura’s about 11 or so and no answer left a message for you on Kelly’s cell.  You guys should get an answering machine or bill a cell phone.  Love ya everyone!

      I've been around for you I've been up and down for you But I just can't get any relief I've swallowed my pride for you I've lived and lied for you But you still make me feel like a thief You got me stealin' your love away Cause you never give it Peeling the years away And we can't relive it Oh I make you live And you make cry I believe it's time for me to fly  You said we'd work it out You said that you had no doubt That deep down we were really in love Oh, but I'm tired of holding on To a feeling I know is gone I do believe that I've had enough  I've had enough of the falseness Of a worn out relation Enough of the jealousy In the entire duration Oh I make you live And you make me cry I believe it's time for me to fly  {Refrain}  Time for me to fly Oh, I've got to set myself free Time for me to fly And that's just how it's got to be I know it hurts to say goodbye But it's time for me to fly Oh, don't you know it's...  {Refrain}  It's time for me to fly

      Greetings from Illinois.  Star and I talked all is well.  I've talked to Arlynd twice today already.  I'm so nervous.  God I feel like it's my first time meeting him or something.  I hear his voice and I melt.  I talked to Jeff today too.  I realized I forgot a check for the oil sending until for the lincoln.  Means I have to go out to Dan's tomorrow.  More nervous about tonight.    GOD am I insane?  I think I've got him if I want him.  Just not sure if I want him or not.  I mean  friend's with benefits is one thing.  Do I want another man in my life right now?  Like Kel said maybe I'm just afraid of being lonely.  That IS quite possible.  I suppose after him and I go for dinner I'll know how the rest of the night's going to be.  See if I am a babbling idiot at dinner. I wish some thing would just send me the ultimate sign saying that this is right.  I am still torn.  I mean my heart is here in Illinois, just scared I am making the wrong decision.  I guess as long as I hold true to myself then i will never be upset in the long run cause I did what I wanted to do when I wanted to do it.  So tonight it's about me and him.  Time to get down to the basics.  I WANT to know him better.. Question is does he want to know me better than just a fuck?  God I hope so.  I mean the last thing I wanted was a boyfriend screwing up my plans, but somehow I don't think he would screw anything up for me.  We have so much in common.  He knows I have a lot of male friends and I know he has friends, hobbies, and work that limit his time.  Parts of me just don't want to lt him out of my site this time.  Somehow the chess pieces all are working in my favor.. All most too good to be true.  I mean good things come to those who wait.. I guess I just didn't think that I had to wait this long.  I think maybe too he knows I just like him because he is the way he is.  I don't EXPECT anything from him but a hug.  I know I am not his top priority i think he appreciates that.. We are much more grown up now then we were then.  Lots of things have changed in the way I view things.  So maybe he IS the right one.  I guess only time will tell.  At this point I am not ruling anything in or out.  I plan on keeping Jeff in my life as long as I can.. Maybe he'll open his eyes and see where his heart really is.  Maybe not.. Like i said I am not ruling anything out right now.  Life is too flip floppy.

       Sagittarius  Mon Oct. 21, 2002 by Astrocenter.com  Don't let the overwhelming emotionalism of the day get in the way of your plans, dear Sagittarius. Be aware, however, that this sensitive force is very strong and will most certainly have a transforming effect on your psyche. This is a good time to dream, and dream big. Remember that you don't necessarily have to travel to the far reaches of the Earth to find freedom and happiness. You have just about everything you need right inside you.

      Over hearing a convo between Val and Jeff...  Jeff: so being a beautician what are your thoughts on the flobee??        my hair is so fucked up I have to wear a hat.        I'm afraid to go to any other hairstylist... I've gotten involved with every hairstylist i've gone to.        You know I'm at that 40 thing.. It's a life changing year.. What if the hairstylist is a guy??? Will I become involved??        What if I think it's a girl and it turns out to be a guy??  he's still with that black guy?? Man they have been together a long time. I bet he was looking for a way out the only black guy in a room full of white people. I was in a few neighborhoods today where I was the only white guy in the parking lot and in the stores..     scary?? no..      I haven't heard a gun shot in weeks...  Couldn't help but laff!

      Only in detroit...  Will you see a 1967ish yellow cadillac convertable with a black top with a black man driving it combing his balding head, smoking a cigarette yelling at his woman tht is 3 times his size.  Will you see a man wearing a checker board patterned denim jacket and matching pants, in this case walking across the street carrying balloons and just last week he was wearing the SAME outfit.. With a pick in his fro!

      She lays on top of me.. Not a light on in the room... a street light shines from outside upon her skin , so soft it glows. It brings out the blue aura all ready around her.   It makes her red hair turn auburn. The sweat from wonderful sex glistens and dances upon her What a beautiful moment!

Even tho in the dream the child was a boy I think it's screaming at me it's time to meet my daughter.  I wonder if they would come down and meet me...

      OK so Jeff and I talked and kissed and "made up".  At least until my next blow up... I made him tell me 5 reason why he loves me.  Actually I was rather suprised what came out of his mouth. I don't remember the order but.    1) because I stuck by him during the lowest parts of his life 2) because my sexual horizon are never quite fullfilled and they seem infinate 3) because I love him 4) because I am a friend and i can't remember 5  anyway... at least I made him sit and think about why he puts up with my mood swings.  OK idea hopping.. For all those who require a weeks plan out of me.  Friday, yes mike it's Friday now... Get last paycheck from Mcd's and turn in uniforms.  Cash my check and run to petsmart to return a dead fish Saturday hang out with Jon and Rhoda.. I hope Sunday pack up my puter, load up the green tub, pack up the car, hook Jeff's puter up to the cable modem, Finish up laundry and actually put it away, watch Soprano's. Monday head out to Illinois.  UNLOAD, find a Culver's near the house go apply over there and simply not work weekends. Tuesday get my lap top worked on.  Spend some time with Arlynd.  Go watch the girls shoot pool if Arlynd let's me out of his sites. Wednesday phone call day. McHenry Court House pay off a ticket and down to Elgin. Thursday Head back to Michigan if early enough stop at Gibraltar and set my booth up. Friday Expo, possible party at the apartment Saturday Expo Sunday Expo Sunday night or Monday head back out to illinois

      OK.. so like 11:15 i think it is.. I'm sitting here after he made a wonderful dinner.  Practically in tears...  The phone rings it's Kaitlen calling.. I can't even pick up the phone and say hello.  It's been  a year and a half almost that we've been living together.  We've been together 2 1/2 years.  Maybe that's not a long time for most of you.  But for me it's a life time.  I've never been with someone this long.  Let alone this far away from everyone I love.  I mean when do you say o.k. enough's enough.. After they break al the promises they can?  At first it was "divorce after the house sells".  Now the house has sold it's been over 6 months and still no divorce.  I think the kids not knowing I exist hurts more.  I mean I think at thier age it's one of those things that the truth is what matters.  Living a lie to them is not going to be good in the end.  O.k. some will argue it's not lying to them if they don't know.  But a relationship after 2 1/2 years is bound to unravel.  So, This thing is brewing in me so bad that I almost feel sick to my stomach.  Once upon a time in a fight long ago he threw up in my face that he left his kids for me.. If that was the case wouldn't they know I exist.. Since they don't know i exsist that throws that out of the water.  I would think if I were one of the kids I'd sleep better at night knowing that dad isn't alone.  I mean why would he leave and move 2 states away to be alone instead of living at grandma lou's and Grandpa dan's and being close to us.  I think it would make more sense if he was living with someone else being that far away.  I dunno.  Maybe I'm over analyzing the situation.  So then there is this divorce issue.  Why doesn't he get a divorce cause Idon't make it a neccessary. I don't say well, divorce her before you can have me.  I mean I know he doesn't want to be with her, but then why doesn't he just end it?  He says to me "make some calls for me".  Should that be HIS priority?? Well of course it's not because he still has me.  Relationships shouldn't be this hard.  This is why I am moving back home.  I think I will be takin gas much as I possibly can with me this time around.  Not just a small portion.  LEt him feel the lonliness like I have felt it.  Maybe he'll understand.. Prolly not tho.. Boys are SOOOOOOOOO stupid!    Oh incase I forgot to mention earlier.  I have to move unix boxes AGAIN!  So the rest of the site might not work for a few days until I can get everything else up and running.  Maybe if AOL didn't suck donkey balls so bad I wouldn't move.. Anyway... I'll check back in after my insomnia kicks in.. maybe i'll feel better

      comcast had yet another momentary lapse of reason.   They call it "system upgrade" yet my sservice doesn't run any better.  For the upload speed I am getting I am almost better going with DSL.  Ameritech DSL might suck but i wonder what AOL dsl is like.  I wonder if they allow for smtp... OH it's late now i can sleep now that my machine is up and running agian.

      Good Lord!  What a day! Jeff and I decided NOT to go to Port Huron.  Not that big of  a deal.  I decided to take out my lap top and see if the fucking thing would boot. Threw a win2k cd in it.  It Powered up, seemed to try and read the hard drive then tried to read the cdrom.  Still no boot. So I called Arlynd "THE MAN".  He said he'll fix it.  So i said well ya i assume u have the right tools, and his response was... Ya and I have the right tool to fix other things too.. AND OH MY i melted.  God I love when he talks like that.  Normally it's not a turn on for me, but that means I am doing something right.  My nrother said I should go grab him.  I think I will maybe talk to him about what he wants, besides the absolute obvious.  I placed an ad on sexyads for Round Lake.  No hits just yet.  Oh well, no big loss.  I relaized that Jeff isn't all that bad of a guy, I'm just SO homesick he can do nothing right.  Kelly and Bill are going to drive me nuts, but that's ok they are worth it.  After careful contempation, I think the red headed dork from the horse racing is gonna get knocked off for fucking with the horse.  Just a thought.

      Well, been an eventful week.   Last Friday - I had a dream I was foxhunting Arlynd.. Haven't seen him in like 4-5 years haven't talked to him in 6-7... (there's a reason I'm telling you this)   Last Sunday - Car broke down, ran it out of gas, asked Jeff to come help me, he didn't because he thought I was lying to him so I can use his Lincoln I can't stand to drive, and take that out to chicago which I have never done before.  So because I was hound him fo ran answer as to why he can't trust me and why he would think I'd lie about that he called me a cunt.  Not only a cunt but actually Can't Understand Normal Thinking came out of his  mouth.. Mind you he's the one telling me that I'm lying about a car breaking down.   Monday - Treked out to Chicago with a few things, LOUD music some clothes and a plan.  I decided to move out to chicago but do it slow and make sure all the dominoes are in order.  So after rehashing a few options I thought I had I realized I didn't have many.     On the way stopped at the 104 and fixed my c.b. he r.f. gain knob was all fucked up and fixed the broken roger beep switch. (pay attn.) Called Jeff cause he beeped me.  He sounded apologetic and genuinely sorry for being a cock.   So I'm west bound 94 hitting the state line.  Can't listen to 19 cause a mudhopper on 6 is wipping out the channel.  So I fly down to 6 to see who it is.  I'm listenin to Dr J wipe me out from california.  Way out in the weeds I hear shotgun shotgun shotgun.  Not thinking much of it.  357 shotgun.  Still not thinking much about it.  I'm listening to this guy, and trying to get a hold of high plains drifter, no luck... So anyway I'm listening to shotgun for a good hour now I'm up near 294 and Irving Park.  Finally he goes " I got up I go tout I got gone."  My heart stopped I swear to god.  I screamed so loud!  I keyed up screaming for him "Bad Ass, Lady 12" repeatedly.  Kept keying for him until I finally got a hold of him mind yo this was at peterson and 83.  So he finally goes "who keeps calling me".  Told him "you are such an addiction", I think he was as shocked as I was!  We met up at the Wendy's on Peterson and 45.  God he looked so good.  I got the biggest hug.  I almost started crying.  We grabbed a bite to eat.  Decided to go watch the Bears and Packers play (Brett Farve is a cutie!).     I picked up Bill first figuring that Arlynd would blow me off.  Went to Joyce's continued to get REALLY drunk.  Arlynd showed up about an hour later.  My heart stopped again when he walked in the bar.  We talked for a long time.  Bill and i talked about him and Kel, Arlynd talked about me and him and the whole Dawn mess.  I told him he's not gonna be able to get rid of me this time.  He said "it's all good!"  Made me feel better.    About 1:30am Doug shows up.  Met Shannon, she reminds me of someone but not sure who.  She seems ok i guess.  I dragged him outside gave him his dogtags.  We hugged for like 3 minutes.  Got a great kiss.  We went back inside.  I wasn't about to leave with him when I had Arlynd next to me.  Especially when I was drunk.  If I ws sober that'd be different prolly.     I remember leaving the bar, taking Bill home, dropping off my car at mom and dad's hopping in to Arlynd's van, and opening the front door of Arlynd's house.  Don't remember the trip there though :).  I suddenly remembered why he was such an addiction in the first place.  A beautiful 9 inches, and talented OMG!!!   Tuesday - Talked to Starr about moving in over there.  So that seems to be the best option.  After that got all settled in I went and watched the girls shoot.  Bonnie did awesome! Hung out with Little Kelly and Bill.   Wednesday - Contemplated exactly how I was going to go about doing everything.  Hung out with Rich for a short.     Thursday - Started calling on jobs, found a recording engineer job.  If nothing else I think I got the website account.   Friday - Moved my clothes over to Starr's, put together her desk for my puter, moved a couch to the garage moved a recliner upstairs.  Went out to eat with Starr.  Decided for some STRANGE reason to come back to Michigan.  I came across an expedite van does local trips.  Thinking I'm gonna go for coffee with him and see if he wants some company sometime, seems nice enough, was very polite, does a lot of trips between michigan and illinois, still gives me a little freedom and a chance to see jeff, possibly a free trip with stuff  .     So there's my week in a nutshell.

      Arlynd you are an asshole.  I cant believe you were like that again!!  All I was trying to do was sober you up a bit.  God somedays I just hate you I really do.  Should have been a clue when you jumped off your van and I had to stop you from falling.  Anyway, hope you are safe.  All the sudden I know where I belong.  Been a long time since I felt this way.  I want you all to smack me if you see me fucking up me and Brian.  Larry asked me last night what's taking us so long.  I'm not sure what he meant by that.  If it's what I think it is then I'm really not sure what's taking us so long.  Maybe just me getting a job could be it.  It's a priority thing.  I mean him and I are a priority, but money talks.    Strange of all the people in my life being with Brian was not what I had planned on.  I asked him last night what makes us keep coming back to each other, he said he's not sure.  I asked him a bunch of other serious questions and he actually answered them.  I guess I will just wait for him to get up then cuddle in so he knows i am there.  Allie girl.. I miss ya honey  Jeff, just be a friend hon.. that what i need right now.

      My chest caved in Ached like never before Uncertainty sets I just want him more  I thought he knew me I thought I knew him Thought we knew each other Then he left on a whim  We cuddled close He opened up He got scared ‘Cause he thought it was love  He’s not sure And that’s ok We’ll get stronger As long as I stay  Staying close Isn’t hard As long as it’s love He has my heart

      The choices we make can be life changing.  Impressive thought!  Let’s dwell on this for a moment.  When I left October 6th that was a choice.  Not a life changing choice, or so I thought.  I thought I was making an effort to give us a well needed few days break.  It just seemed like everything was falling in to place.  I ran in to Arlynd and money and a place to stay besides mom and dad’s.  Everything was screaming at me to stay in Illinois, except my heart.  Everyone around me says I’ve all ready made my choice.  I knew I hadn’t.  I knew that the trip back to pick up some stuff was going to be the “life choice”.  At that particular moment I would know where my life would be.  I knew we would either make it or break it.  Friday was nice.  Saturday was nice.  I almost thought that we could work with what was happening.  He rubbed my feet like he really missed me.  Then he said “put your hand on my cock”.  I knew then and there that deep down I was a piece of meat.  I knew why he wanted me around.  He says he needs me.  Yeah right.  Since my stuff didn’t all fit in my car, I knew that I’d have to see him again.  So a few weeks goes by.  I knew that this next time was DEFINITELY going to be the life choice.  I knew it’d be make it or break it.  And what did he do?  Expected a piece.  Yet once again confirming I am a piece of meat.  I called him the next few days, and was confirmed he doesn’t give a shit about MY plans.  The way he talked to me on the phone just blew my mind.  I invited him out to meet Brian and chit-chat.  What is his response?  Do I have a place to crash?  He wonders why I am so frustrated.  THAT was when I made my decision.  I’m staying here amongst my family and friends.    I also made the decision that the man that I am going to be with will not stop me from being around those I love and just accept them as part of my life.  The man that I will be with will not be embarrassed that I am not a girlie girl.  The man that I am with will not be a self-centered egotistical prick!  They will not keep me guessing on when I want I get to see them.  I will not have to worry about them cheating on me.  Running away when they get too close.  They will be at least not tossing out the idea of settling down.  The possibility that I haven’t found that guy is very disheartening.  I mean EVERY guy I have been with is lacking in one of those fields.  Except for maybe Brian.  The only thing he’s lacking is the running away part.  I guess I have to have one fear.    You all tell me that relationships don’t have to be hard.  You are all right.  This time it’s just too easy.

      How can we go from being so wrong for each other to being so right for each other in the matter of a few years?  Is it that we both grew up?  Maybe we both realized that love is in the first place you look.  Think about it.  If you WANT to love someone you do.  You can either look for it in that special person, or cast them aside as a piece of meat.  It’s a choice you make.  Some hopeless romantics believe that love is fate.  These are 2 totally different ideas.  Being with one person over another might be considered fate.  But loving them is a choice.  You might not have had anything to do with the fact you are sitting next to someone.  That is fate.  You do have a choice to let that person in your heart and soul.    I have often heard people tell me that they have found their soul mate.  Funny, most of the time these are the same people that tell me they don’t believe in God.  How can you have a soul without believing that there is life after death.  How can you have a soul understanding how a human gets a soul?  I really truly don’t understand that.  I firmly believe that you will have a hard time finding your soul mate if you do not have a reason to be the best you can be for a life after this one.  You are here just simply for the moment.  The choices you make are based on a moral standard.  Which is good, however why have morals if you don’t believe in a better life after you die.  I don’t understand how people can go through life and feel so empty.  I think this is why they say they have found their soul mate.  It makes them feel complete because they lack the feeling God would give them.    I don’t feel I NEED a soul mate.  I guess I would know if I had one.  So I guess I never have had one.  I can go through the important guys in my life and remember when I felt really awesome and other times I felt like a piece of meat.  Even with the ones I have in my life right now.  No need to spill my guts and hurt feelings.  Save that for a rainy day.    I know this much… Joyce said something the other night that really made me sit back and think.  She said you know what I don’t remember seeing you this giddy over a guy since Brian.  I haven’t seen him in years I told her.  When I was with Brian before I knew we weren’t right for each other.  I knew that we were in different stages in our lives.  This time around I know I that our lives are pretty close to even.  Neither one of us are happy with the money situation.  Both of us miss each other when we are separated.  I know I balance him out and he balances me out.  It’s a nice change of pace.  It’s not difficult.  I can’t remember the last relationship that was easy, or that didn’t bring a whole lot of baggage with it.  Last night we were cuddling.  It was one of those nights where we didn’t have to say a whole lot.  I think we were on the same page without having to say a word.  Last time I had a feeling like that I was with Doug.  Before that I can’t remember the last time.  I knew he wasn’t laying there thinking about work.  I knew he wasn’t thinking about bills and kids and ex’s. Just wrapped up in the moment.  Didn’t have a worry in the world except making sure the other wasn’t crying.  It was quite enchanting.  It’s very hard not to totally give him my heart. I promised myself I wouldn’t do that.  Sometimes fate does kick in.  I can choose to not have him in my life.  I can choose to slow down.  I don’t want to though.  How fucked up is that??

      Went to the farm.  We got this huge ass light to play "spotlight on deer".   We took down the paintball field, cut a small trail from the farm yard to the paintball field area and gonna put up a blind there for "sightseers".  Went to a really dumb antique appraisal.  Went to the casino.  Ok as if that wasn't enough.    My p.c. crashed on Friday.  So Boy is gonna bring over a hard drive and see if that's it or if it's the motherboard.   Gloria's talent thing is tonight.  So it's a toss up between blowing off Gloria, hanging out with Brian, Bill and a guy named Todd, or heading over to Joyce's.  Guess it all depends on if Boy is coming over otnight or tomorrow.  Ok, you men say us women are hard to figure out.  You say go when you mean stay. You say never when you mean right now. You say you don’t have time while you are dawdling to leave.  When I asked you why you touch me one way and talk another, your answer was I don’t know. Is that a defense mechanism or a game? I guess I’m just not sure what I am to you, so the questions run through my head.  The girls say he’s just a boy he doesn’t know what he wants But when I ask a man’s opinion he says go with the touch. The touch says yes.  The shell says no.  I don’t get it. Why are you so afraid to talk to me?  Have I hurt you before?  The women say that guys just don’t know how to talk to anyone. The guys say that as soon as a guy admits how he feels about someone it goes to shit. Is that what is going on?  Worried if you say something it’s gonna go to shit?  God I wish you’d just tell me where I stand before it’s too late once again

      Let’s see where do I start?  Monday deposited my check and hung out with Bill and a “guy named Todd” (a George Carlin thing)  Tuesday I put in a few resumes online.  Then went to the bank withdrew some money to pay Star and have a little bit of spending cash, paying Kel back money I owed her.   Called Arlynd left a little voice mail.  Called Jeff and found out he’s coming out tomorrow.   I miss him so it’s cool he’s coming out.  He’s bringing the rest of my stuff with him so  I’ll feel a little more at ease.  Maybe go do dinner or something.  I know Jeff will read this later and be upset with me, but if I don’t write it out I’ll never get it off my chest.   I’ve had a few ask me why I came back.  I tell them that Jeff and I needed some space and that I was homesick.  The event that did it was, we were sitting on the couch rubbing each other’s feet.  Enjoying the tenderness I forgot he had inside him.  Told him that I realized that he was carrying all the material things in the relationship, and that I was carrying all the emotional side.  Though I liked the things he was doing as far as material I was lacking the emotional stuff.  It was more of a business partnership than a relationship.  So back to the foot rub stuff. I was really starting to relax in to HIS new apartment.  I realized the last apartment was HIS too.  It wasn’t ours.  It was HIS.  All HIS furniture all HIS pots and pans and dishes.  Everything I wanted to bring was not what he wanted.  Hell I couldn’t even have my own dresser.  I was forced to look at a wall while I was on the computer cause it was HIS office.  I was merely residing there.  As the foot rub continued, mind you this was after a bunch of food and about 45 minutes of a foot rub, he says “put your hand on my cock”.  There was no please, no eye contact, nothing.  I’m supposed to be really turned on with that and just go oh yah baby no problem.  NO other man has ever done that before.  So why should I deal with that now?    I deal with it because I love him but I tell ya what…  It’s getting old really fast!  I asked you several times why you do that.  That is so degrading.  Especially after such a nice night.

      Love is in the first place you look Sometimes life gets in the way Love doesn't have a rule book Sometimes life just slips away  You can change your mind You can't change your heart Love is truely blind So you need to be smart  Don't confuse life and love Don't confuse love and lust Don't do things you are not proud of Know the difference between faith and trust  Hold on to your friends Don't judge too fast A heart mends and a memory lasts  A heart beats A mind drifts Love repeats Life shifts  Love is something you can not touch A soul is something you can not see Life is sometimes way too much If it doesn't come back it wasn't meant to be  Let your heart soar Let your mind be free Let your love pour Let your soul touch me

      It's been an eventful week.  Thursday went pretty good.  Jeff and I did a lot of talking while we were packing.  Realizing that I was carrying the emotional side of the relationship, he was carrying the material side to the relationship. Neither one of us shared the other's responsibilty.  We also know that IF we get back together this time it's going to be because we want to be there not because we feel we are trapped or becoming a creature of habit.  Arlynd and i did nothing but fight Saturday.  The expo was Sunday.  It didn't go nearly as well as expected.  I got to shake a lot of hands, got some nice software, landed one more computer out of the owner of the expo.  So now i have December and January's table paid for.  I'm hoping next time these people see me i'll be able to scrounge upsome business.  I figure I'm not out any money so might as well give it a try.  Monday, so far so good... Can't complain a whole lot.  Need to go through last week's advertiser.  Follow up on Jayme and Diane's calls.

      Incase anyone was wondering I'm still in michigan  packing up. Most of my stuff fit in my car.  Jeff will be bringing out the rest next week.  Bill and Kelly: Love you guys I'll need your help when i get back. Rob: Have a safe trip honey.  You never gave me your pager #  Thought for the day why didn't  god make penises come out of the top of the head Then thoughts of men wouldn't be so far apart from each other there's enough blood to run through both brains. We can call em dickheads and they won't get mad..  Picture in your mind a man trying to fuck you with his heads. Then you'd definately know if it was pee or cum..

      Ok so I know he hasn't seen Lora since Thursday.  Makes me feel better.  He's hooked on Golf so I know I have his attn for a while at least.  Now all the sudden he tells me he's comingo out tonight.  I promised Char I'd help her with her party.  I know neither one will want to go to that.  So I guess I am flying solo.  I can't remember the last date i had for new years.

      When the road gets dark And you can no longer see Just let my love throw a spark And have a little faith in me And when the tears you cry Are all you can believe Just give these loving arms a try And have a little faith in me And  CHORUS: Have a little faith in me Have a little faith in me Have a little faith in me Have a little faith in me  When your secret heart Cannot speak so easily Come here darlin' From a whisper start To have a little faith in me  And when your back's against the wall Just turn around and you will see I will catch, I will catch your fall baby Just have a little faith in me  for Arlynd

      Ok so like WOW.  I have to tell you about my last 24 hours.  ok so it's Star's birthday weekend.  So we decided she's not sobering up.  Anyway, Friday I was totally awesome!  Bill got me a hair cut.  Donna gave me this do that left my top long and my back short short.   Then I went to see Lord of the Rings with Rich and went to dinner.  Then I ended up takin gStar out for drinks at Joyce's and the bar was PACKED!  Man it was so much fun in there.  her and I were stoned and having a good old time.  We were all dresed up and getting hit on by every man in the bar.  Arlynd ended up showing up.  So we got our drinks for free and he was in an awesome mood.  Made the night even better.  He ended up on the couch because I knew if we did anything I would NOT be able to look Brian in the eye.    God how can I be so torn?  I mean I have arlynd... Pro/con time  good   he's fun he's good in bed well endowed smart funny makes decent money good looking   bad  he's a drinker smoker in to himself knows how to push my buttons has lora to fall back on  Brian  good  Stephen includes me in family stuff his parents love me his bro likes me and his sister likes me grandma has adopted me hard worker he gets along with my family great lover i can tell him just about anything not smoking cigarettes anymore   bad  perpetually broke let's his dad run he weekends would rather hang out with bill most of the time then me  (somethings never change) He has REALLY early mornings  I'm lik eso torn.  I think I just want one to step up to the plate.  I'm tired of dating.  I want one man that wants me the same as i want him.  that's all.  Is that too much to ask?  Anyway to finish up the last 24 hours....  Arlynd left about 8am I went back to bed didn't get up unti llike 11:30.  Les got here about 11:45 and started to work on getting dsl hooked up.  Since we couldn't do it with the equipment we had we waited for my puter geek friend Bob to get here.  We decided wireless hub was the way to go.   About 5:00 or so Jeff showed up with some things he thoght I'd want to have.  He brought my vision poster, my wind chimes, my aranetta drawing, my ring and videos.  We talked for a short bit.  I felt like crying.  One one hand he was being bery sweet.  I just don't think he realized that I am having a hard time accepting how good his life is without me.  How nice it could have been if he just followed thru on things.  Bob came downstairs in the nick of time and with a wonderful call from kelly to break the strangeness the night quickly ended.  I'm not sure if it was a good thing or not.  So I go to the bar to meet Arlynd I am there about 20 minutes and Star calls and wants to go out.  So I went back home and got her and then went back to Joyces and sat by Bridget, she's SO cool!  So then after she got there Mike and Kathy Robinson showed up and shortly after LeeLee, Dana, and Rick showed up.  Not a whole lot can ruin my night at this point.  I found out from Tama last night that not only is Lora a whore but she's a crack whore.  So I told Bonnie that and she's like oh I know and I know she's being evicted.  TOTALLY made my night.  Since I am friends with the building inspector AND my dad is on the condemming board it wasn't hard!!!  So that like totally made my life easier.  I did come to one downside of this now I won't know where to find her tho.    I'm hoping Arlynd is serious when he says that him and her about done anyway.  I'm sick of worrying about if he's out here and I say no that he'll be with Lora moments later.  Scares me to death.  I mean I asked him Thursday to just take it somewhere else.  If he's gonna do that just go to a different bar.  He agreed to that but I don't think he has any intensions of leaving the bar any time soon.  So that might mean he's done with her cause I think he knows that her ass is mine now.  Unless he really is that inconsiderate.  Somehow I don't think that's the case he just wants to act like he'd do that so I'm on my toes.  Ok and is the touch all that i should be worrying about and not necessarily the words that come out of his mouth?  that is the realy question of the day.

      The shield (revised)  You taught me so much about friendship and trust and for an officer that means so much  You are complicated man but your beliefs are strong to serve with pride and strength even when the nights are long  I give you all the respect  that one friend could give another in return that is what I expect you gives that like no other  we have a strange relationship that everyone can see what no one understands is the friendship that the other desperately needs  You wear a shield  Proud and bold it protects your heart that I'd love to hold  I glad I had a chance to say that I'm glad to know you like I do I think about you when I pray Always remember I love you!  ~August 17, 2000 For Sargeant Michael Robinson

      A Christmas Gift (Revised)  I had one wish for Christmas that not just anyone could fill I was a big gift from heaven  and spoke of love's will  It was a simple gift but hard to obtain It was to have someone special, that I can contain  Someone that was only mine  and that cared for me too Someone that can see right through me and someone that was true  I wanted to be touched I wanted someone I can hold I wanted to be loved like the first time and my first time was gold!  Be careful of what you wish for  It just may come true Don't doubt me for a second Because now I have you  ~Christmas Eve 2002

      Well lots has happened since my last blog.  You might be happy to know I have kicked my birthday blahs to the curb.  I took Brian to Christmaas that seemed to do the trick.  I am not sure if I will take him to the Lannan side for christmas day or not.  Haven't asked him.    Michael took Candy to Christmas.  That was pretty cool.  Afterwards Michael, Candy, Brian and Myself went over to Joyce to shoot some pool and then over to Chili's for desert.  I never thought in a hundred million years he'd be a public display of affection sort of guy.  He was like ALL over her it was awesome!  A little wierd cause I've never seen him like that but cool none the less.  Christmas shopping is no where near done. I'm gonna burn Brian a cd or two or three.  I burned my dad's yesterday.  I will attempt to burn Michael's today.  Not sure how I'm going to doall that just yet.    Jeff is in town, looking forward to seeing him.  Parts of me miss the normalicy of Michigan.  Other parts of me are sick of crying.  I wonder if now he's divorced I'd be as stressed as I was.    I do love Brian and I know Brian loves me but I hope to God I can put aside the fact that at one time I was addicted to Jeff, when I see him.  It will be an interesting challenge.  I am going thru the "I'm not calling Arlynd" phase.  I took him out of my cell phone.  I call Les instead.  My phone over here is being retarded.  It's not hanging up like it's supposed to and it's driving me insane.  If I get some money from mom and dad for christmas I'm buying a cordless.  My computer is up and running.  I have a nice motherboard and 1700 processor on it.  I think I am going to build me a new machine.  I have enought parts laying around except for a case and a cpu fan.  We have dsl but it's not downstairs yet.  Should be by the end of the year  .

      Man this morning sucked ASS! Besides getting up before Brian......  I picked up Ozzy on time (6:45).  Went to McDonald's per normal.  They shorted us $10.  2 mornings ago they shorted us a parfait.  Yesterday they shorted us a parfait AND screwed up my burger.  Today shorted us $10.  Every once in a while I love having Christine Shenk on speed dial. Didn't pull in until 8:00.  Last night me and Brian went up to bill and todd's  made a mac and cheese thingy.  Wasn't as good as I had hoped. Wrestling is getting sooooo boring to me I think I'm gonna pass on that for a while.  Ok I called tiger direct.  Got a shipping number.  My motherboard was delivered on the 11th.  Nice of my parents to tell me.  The processor won't be here until Thursday now.  Don't know weather to be pissed at mom and dad for not telling me or for tiger direct to sell a combo of motherboard and processor and not send the processor and it's on back order.. why sell the combo if it's not there

      Aquarius can try many new things but end up mastering none. That can stifle the great success    potential here. Slowing down long enough to establish a solid foundation gives Aquarius the ability to ground his or her electrical energy.  Humm mastering none.. I don't know about that, he could master me if he set his might to it.  He grounds himself with me most of the time.  Wish he couldjust see that.. OH well!

      At work today, which is totally awesome.  Learned how to do lettering digitizing.  Hopefully I'll learn how to sew soon.  I think I got Mike's christmas gift covered.  I think Arlynd is coming out tonight.  I don't even feel like going out.  Maybe I can convince him of a night in.  Mike ordered my motherboard, should be here next Tuesday.

      I was just wondering...  Why do they make AA AAA C and D batteries but not B batteries?  When a guy drills you a million and one questions what does that mean? Does that mean he remotely cares?  He was asking "so who's bud light is in the garbage", knowing damn well I don't drink beer. So I told him it was Bill's (Kelly's hubby). Then he asked me why I made sure that Bill got with Tama Then he asked me if he was the only one.  I told him no Brian.  He sounded suprised.  It was almost like he was "hurt".  I mean how can you hurt  someone that doesn't have a heart?  I know i've told him before but maybe it never sank in, or I just assumed he knew.  .  For someone that doesn't want me as a "girlfriend" he sure seemed genuinely concerned about who i was "hanging" with.  I have SO many questions I need answers to.  You know some questions that if i had the answer for it would ease my mind as to why he is the way he is.  Wonder if I will ever feel comfortable enough to ask him.  How can I care about two people that are so totally different from each other?  I mean Arylnd breaths life in to me while Brian mellows me out.  Arylnd always says I gotta go I gotta go but never wants to leave.  Brian never wants to leave my side.  Both are family oriented.  Both are hard workers.  Brian has a lot of respect for me where Arlynd doesn't.. That's about his only negative.  Sexually they are night and day different.  Not as different in size or shape but I mean how they are.  One is a dom one is more sub. One is more sensual.  One is more kinky.  AHHHHHHHHHHHH it's killing me!  I'm so torn!

      Well… How was my birthday???  I got an “oh by the way happy birthday” from my dad and mike AFTER I called them.  I didn’t even talk to my mom.  I sent Mike out the page that has the motherboard I want on it so we will see if that happens.    Day started out by me helping Kelly move out AGAIN.  Followed by hanging out with little Kelly and getting blown off by Barb.  Followed by Dinner with Rich at El Rodeo, which was about the only good thing of the day.  Then I had to go to Sharky’s and shoot.  I didn’t taking any points again, against a team I hate.  John Weber was whooping my ass in pool but got some good tips off of him, I need to work on my English.    Got back to the bar and was drilled about me and Arylnd.  At that time, I was told he walked in with Kelly Friday night and Saturday and went home with Laura on Saturday night.  So when I asked Kelly about it she said he was there all ready both nights when she walked in.  When I asked Arlynd about Lora he confirmed the fact that he fucked her.  He can’t seem to figure out why it’s my business.  It’s like hello if you are fucking me and her damn right it’s my business.  I was also told by Tama that Kelly said I wanted her.  I told Tama that if I wanted her she’d know it.  I then made an announcement to everyone in the bar that Brian was my boyfriend, just so there wasn’t any confusion.    All I want is my p.c. back, then he can pretty much go to hell.  You fucked me once shame on you.  You fucked me twice shame on me.    If I should stay I would only be in your way.  So I’ll go, but I know, I’ll think of you every step of the way. – Dolly Parton  Oh incase anyone was wondering what I got on my birthday, Brian bought me a ring.  Sort of a “promise ring”.  I gave him my rng my mom got me and told him as long as he has that in his possession I’m not gone yet.  I haven’t really asked him if this ring means the same thing but I’m thinking it does.

      con·tent2    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (kn-tnt) adj. Desiring no more than what one has; satisfied.   i think that word sums it up.  I talked with Arlyn.  Not sure how i feel right now.  I'm in overload i think.  Nothing bad.  I'm not going to plot death upon him anymore.   Brian is such a good guy.  I feel so bad for what I've put him thru.  I WILL make it up to him.  I'm just not sure how.  I just need to be held right now.  God I hate this feeling.  Like my heart was just ripped out of my chest thrown on the ground and a happy dance was done on it.  I think aft4er the inital hurt is over i'll be good as new.  I at least have closure which is what i needed.

      Ok so how do you put sex drive in a man.  He's 28, I'm 28.  We've had sex before and it's been good when I get it.  Almost makes it worth the wait.  He sleeps next to me just about every night and I can't help but wonder what's wrong with me.  Why is he not interested in sex?  I mean I don't think I've done anything wrong.  I can't think of what I can do to make him want me more.  I don't think he wants me any less.  I know him and I are ok as far as I know how he feels about me I don't ever doubt his sincerity.  I'm just worried about why his sex drive is so low.

We hold off on the third just to take it all in not sure how stoned we are all we do is grin  A few minutes go by here it comes again we are all smiles and inhale it all in

      Today has been pretty cool.. Brian and I slept in mostof the morning.  I went over to mom and dad's and my mom and i started putting together my quilt.  It's a simple patch quilt.  It's got black back ground with chili peppers on it and the middle square rotate between red orange and yellow.  We got all the squares cut out and the rows sewn up.  It still needs the rows sewn together a border, batting, a back, and ribbon.. I think another 4 hours should be just about done.

      I have come to find out that MOST lesbians were straight or Bisexual at one time in thier life or another.   They were uncertain about their sexuality preference or were unable to find a woman and settled for a man. If I hear one more lesbian slam a bisexual and the lesbian has children or was married, I am going to explode. I am bisexual because I have not found a man OR a woman that can be as true to me as I am to them.   If you have found one good for you.

      Well. today was interesting.  Once AGAIN Kel wanted  me to play messenger.  Once again she wasn't happy with the results I had Kel over here in tears all day because Bill told her he didn't want to be around her.  He wasn't going to fuck up him and Tama over Kel.  Then I talked to Cher and had her crying to me too.  Cher, I love you honey.  I wish there was something I can do to ease your mind a little.  Be good and keep your head in the game, play your cards right and you'll be fine.  I really hope Jeff Voell, now called by his last name of Voell, is NOT playing games with me.  I have no reason to hold back my feelings this time.  He told me to come out tomorrow and fill out a pre employment ap.  I know he dealt with Brandy tonight.  I felt bad for just leaving him hanging, but he'll get over it.  Other than that it was a wonderful day.  Spent time with Brian over at Bill's.  That's getting a little old, but i will be going to school on Mondays now so I won't have to go neener neener neener.......... :P

      Let's see... How was my night??? Well let me fill you in.  Jeff (Foxtrot) totally blew me off.  7:30 I walk up stairs and tell start to spill it.  I thought I was ready for whatever came my way.  She told me she was attracted to Arlynd.  More than an attraction.  I think she said she was in love with him.  I knew it.  I felt it in my gut.  I felt it in my heart.  I was going to go downstairs and be comfortably numb and forget about it.  Called Doug Called Kelly Called Bill Called Rich  Michael calls wants to go out.  So I think that's a good idea of course.  So we end up going out.  End up over at Joyce's.  I was saying stuff... I'm not sure what I said... I know it was psycho sounding.  Scared Star.  Her and Arlynd had words.  She left.  I told him he better go fix whatever he fucked up.  He went and got her brought her home.  By that time I went to the other side of the bar and waited for his return.  I was having fun with the bar crew and p.r. Joe.  All I know is I was with Brian all night Monday night never went to the bar, but supposedly ended up giving joe a blow job. Rich came and went (Hope ya feel better honey).  Mike and Candy were there Mike was sort of my body guard.  It was pretty cool!  I like her so much.  She makes him so happy.  I hope to God they make it.  Anyway it's like 11:00, after a few long hours f playing pool, they leave. I called Brian and talked to him for like an hour at the bar.  Kofron walks in.  Looks really good.  I mean he seemed happy, married with a baby.  Everything he wanted but wouldn't do with me. All those feelings came back.. All the hurt and anger, good times and bad, rushed thru me.  I was a mess.  Arlynd cared none.  He pulled me aside and said "you don't know it but it's goodbye".  5 minutes later i left.  12:30 I go upstairs to try and talk to Star.  She didn't even want to see me.  She was acting like this was all my fault.  I was so ripped up.  I called Brian for like an hour AGAIN.  I called Jeff talked to him for like another hour.  Then she came down and asked if i wanted to come up.  So I did.  After mine and Brian's conversation I think I can trust him again.  I know he'll be there for me.  I know he doesn't think I am totally crazy.  I told Star all this.  I truely feel blessed to have Brian in my life.  I know he'll be good for me.  I knew all he needed was his chance to prove himself to me.  He's done nothing wrong.  It was only after our conversation that I realized I NEED Brian in my life.   I don't NEED Arlynd .  I NEED Rich.  I need Jeff as a friend.  I need Bill.  I think I'm pretty content with those friends right now.  As long as I know I have them I'm ok.  After telling Star exactly how I feel about Brian I think I am really ok with letting go of Arlynd.  I've said from the beginning.... I knew it was only a matter of time.  Arlynd is tying up loose ends.  He was a friend to her tonight.  Who knows maybe this is a good thing.  Right now I'm just trying to deal with it.

You go girl!  went ove to A tire today to fill out an ap.  They said well you don't have 3 different colors of hair or piercings, that's a help.  It's between me and an old retired dude.    Ran in to Kevin Coznicki, and he's gonna go drop a word in for me.  Told him it's worth a back rub to him.

      Let's see... I was by myself on Friday... I hate being by myself EVER. Saturday sucked ass.  Arlynd was being a complete cock head.  Fucked Karen all night long then thought he was going to come downstairs at 9am and me be really happy about that.  So after careful consideration I've decided that Brian IS #1.  Now I just have to prove it.    I talked to Jeff for like an hour on Saturday.  I think he made me realize I'm not ok with consenual fucking unless I am in the picture with a bi female.  That's the ONLY part that i'm ok with.  As long as I can have as much fun as the man then I am ok.  Excluding me is not consenual.    Sunday I was just relaxed.  I had Brian over here.  We did a cuddle up and get comfortably numb evening.  We were in bed by like 7:30.  Got up about 11:00 ate and went back to bed.  Was very nice.  Today I deleted the midi background for you all. Worked on Mike's lap top AGAIN.  I can't seem to figure out why I have a hard drive one minute and reboot and i have no hard drive.. I can get msdos to load sometimes but then after a few reboots says i have no hard drive.  I am really quite irritated.  Called Arlynd about Tech support didn't want to answer the phone.    Talked to Karen for like an hour just now.  We discussed this weekend and I think over what happened.  She felt like she wasn't welcome here, and i had to clear things up.  I'm gonna help her with her pc if she can't get it up and running.  Talked to Scalet i think his hard drive is cashed.  Talked to Tama she failed her test.  Bill called need to call him back.  Brian is gonna want to go to Bill's and I want to go to the bar cause tama is tending bar.  So we'll see who wins.

      Sometimes I amaze myself onhow well I can explain things to people.  I think I finally got it thru Eric's thick skull he's not on center stage anymore.  He joked around about marriage and i laid it on the line.  I told him he needs to choose a path.  His path and my path aren't crossing anymore.  I think he FINALLY understood. Only took me an hour.  I've seen Arlynd everyday since last Thursday.  I'm not sure  if that's a good thing or a bad thing.  I'm not complaining.  The man says jump and I say how high.  I wish he'd see how much he means to me.  That I am there good bad and otherwise.  I think I did good tonight.  He called me i was there like 10 minutes later.  We sat and had a few drinks and out the door he went.  I think I saved him from a depression thing.  I'm not sure.  I'd like to think I did.  I saw him slipping in to this wierdness thing.  He started talking about Scott and the whole tree thing.  Bumbed him out.  I'm starting to understand him a lot more and i think it scares thehell out of him.  He knows the lora subject hurts me and uses it every way he can just to prove he's not "exclusive".  If he wanted to spend this time with her he would have.  But he's in my bed not hers.  I'm so afraid that the moment I say no he'll go running to Lora.  So I think I need to leave my options open.  I mean just not see brian except for like Tuesday nights and Fridays or something.  I need my time free for Arlynd.  I think he's finally starting to fold and I'm not about to loose him out of my life again.  Brian I can live without.   Arlynd is just in my blood.  So many things I do I have him running in my brain.  Not a thing I do changes the way I fell.  I so scared to tell him because I know he'll run and hide.  After nights like this I just wanna tell him..... "you feel this way with me because you CAN"  not for any other reason.  You can feel comfortable with me.  No one can take that away and stop being so scared.  But if I said that he'd be gone after "because you can".    Sweetheart... Put a little faith in me.

      I totally forgot to tell ya all who I ran in to on the radio... 70 - George. I ran in to him last friday night over at brian's parent's house on the radio.  Brian and I went up to see him tonight.  He's still one of my strongest weknesses.  I don't get it.  It's been 6 years and I still have butterflies when i talk to him.  I was a wreck going to his house tonight.  I was nervous as hell.  When I walked in the lights were low.  I looked at him in the shadows and about melted right there.  It was a good damn thing Brian was with me.

      I called Lovin' Oven today and have a 2nd interview set up for Wednesday at 10:30.  They narrowed it down to 3 people.  Mikey dropped off his puter parts.  Brian went to a meeting for Steven's baptism.  Brian took Bill to get his van worked on then went and dropped him back to his van when it was done.  Star is just in a mood this last week.  I'm not sure how much longer she's gonna want me here.  Strange she wanted me here until she started fucking Arlyn.  I guess he won this time.

      Such a strange online world I live in. I'm talking to my brother Mike and my online brother Aris all at the same time and neither one knows the other.  I think I got the job over at Lovin' Oven.  not great pay but better than nothing.. Gas card, cell phone and Sam's Club card AND benefits!  God that will rock.  I'd rather have money and no life than a life with no money.

I gave a message for Nick he called me right back.  We talked for a few minutes.  I think we are going out for a drink tonight.  We shall see.  He called me just now and told me to go over and fill out an application.  So I'm gonna go do that right now.  Pool is tonight we are at AJ's.  It WILL be interesting! Open jam in a place 1/3 of the size of Joyce's.

      To Miss Gloria:  We've seen our share of troublels and worries.   You've been a friend thru it all.   I don't know how I could walk this lonely life  without our 3am phone calls.   When I'm stressed you always try to find the brighter side When your car breaks down I make sure you have a ride When I need a friend to talk to you are the first one in line.   You tell me your secrets I tell you mine. You are more than a friend. You are a best friend. You are priceless   I pray for you all the time. I hold your hand when you need comfort Hug you even if you don't need one In return you stand by me right or wrong.  That in itself is more than a friend could ask for You are more than priceless.

Is it a brave sol staring back at thee  Are you in tune with it's feelings Do you dare try to figure out what's wrong or just stand there and cry  Do you know it's dreams have you ever asked do you really care is it two faced  is it a good egg is it a green eyed monster these are some questions you need to ponder

      Hummmm... let's see... Sunday was a good day.  Worked for an hour.  Went to Brian's for the afternoon.  Him and his dad put brakes on my car as I entertained Stephen.  So not only does my car run better than ever it stops too.  Next step is stereo.    Friday Tama stopped by most of the night.  It was nice just the three of us hanging out.  Ronnie has fallen off the face of the earth AGAIN!  David is really mad at me about something.  He's acting really wierd.  I gotta call him and find out what his problem is.  Ran in to Mike Candy, Adam and Ave Friday night.  I never wanted to hit someone as bad as I wanted to hit Ave.  Talked to Gloria this morning.    Went to lunch with mom. Started going thru pictures with mom to separate in groups.  Came across some pictures of Shelly.  God I miss her so much.  Wierd how things turn out.  I normally don't like  my mother's family much.  But when someone dies I miss them so much years later.  Dad's side who I like more I don't miss them as much.  Strange.

      David blew me off.  Mike blew off Dave.  The mustang still isn't at the house.  Bill called the cops on Kelly being psycho and had Fox Lake cops stop by her house to make sure she was still alive.  Ronnie was out with John again!  John is all drunk AGAIN!  He tells me that she loves me.  If I hear one more person say that and not mean it that will be it.  I'll loose the rest of my brain cells

      The boy walks in thinks he's the stud willing to be with anyone and thinking he could  when he looked all around he was sadly suprised the girls were all taken they saw through his lies  The one that loved him wished he'd look her way the one that he loved pushed him away  he hides his sadness and drowns himself in the beer if i looked real close I might have seen a tear  Pure poetry in motion witnessed 3-1-03

      Had to work today for a few hours.  Went to Sally's and picked out a hair color and a new fangoo head band thingy. Went to the dollar store and picked up a 20 gal tub for Brian's clothes, a can opener, some over the door hangers for my robes, and a lava lamp.  Picked up some sunflowers for the bathroom. Stopped at mom and dad's  picked up my Dr. Pepper my mom got me, a bottle of head and shoulders (I'm gonna try and get rid of these rough spots on my skin with it), a 1999 bottle of white Zin that was in the cupboard, a crystal vase for the flowers and a wine glass. Started laundry and dying my hair now.  I gotta get this place mom clean I can't stand it anymore.  I'm starting a new blog.  Gonna start writing erotica again.  I had a little inspiration the other night so I'm gonna run with it.  It'll be up on the blogs of note when I get it started.

      Well well.. a foot of snow..   You know you gotta love the state of illinois.  We got a foot of snow last night and I was on the tollway at 5am and there wasn't a trace of it.  Illinois Department of Trasportation SALUTE!  You snow birds are awesome!  Now if Lake County could keep up that would be impressive, but still not bad mostly cleared by 10am.    I got back to the shop today and Lorrianne Fancher was there.  She lived across the street from my parents house, the one with the turret on the side. She's gonna be working there.  It will be nice.  Johan messages me more on Phazenet than he EVER did on dalnet.  Wonder what's with him.  Star's sick, so she's home.  I'm going for lunch with mom in like half hour.    Maybe I'll post more later.  Been a long morning gonna go take a nap.

      Ok Allie girl are ya happy?  Wednesday: We won at pool by a tie breaker game Arlyn won by 3 points Thursday:     Went to Duke's with David and Mike and Tommy                     Hey dave you're a light weight man Friday:          Ran some errands with Dave and Brian helped me and Dave move Dave's stuff in his new house Saturday:      Star gave me and eviction notice. Ate some bad soup (got food poisoning).  Went out with Ronnie, left early, went to                       bed, woke up about 1:30am puking and shitting uncontrolably (felt like a bad South Park episode) Sunday:        couldn't get out of bed.  David called me about 4:00pm and decided to tell me I WASN'T moving in and he was going to                     let Kyle move in instead. Mind you I've been hanging around David almost unseparably for like 2 weeks and I haven't met                     this guy, and now he's gonna move in.  I'm not happy! Monday:        woke up feeling MUCH better, just the sniffles  apartment hunted.  Now you know how shitty my week has been I'm gonna go crawl in a hole and stay there.  I'm not feeling well star is being a bitch.  She's really good at making me feel like i did something wrong.     Oh yeah  urlLink Allie's Blog

      Monday - a day off??? yeah as if!  Mom decided that we were going shopping for garden stuff.  Figured I might as well grow some stinky stuff. So I'm planting a rose bush, marigolds, morning glories for allie, pansies for my grandma, black eyed suzies for my dad. oregano, chives from mom's garden, cilantro, basil, and rosemary.  Should be cool.  Monday we did all the shopping.  Mother's Day we are planting.  School was awesome I did a powerpoint presentation that rocked!  Tuesday - 11.5 hour day, nap, and school.  In class we trouble shot 6 puters had a good time.

      Wednesday me and Brian decided that friends with benefits is a good idea until he gets over this whole Arlyn thing.  If he can't get passed that then I don't need him around.  I explained to him that since New Year's Eve I have been totally faithful to him.  I'm not sure if he believes me or not.  Everyone that comes in to my life he considers a threat to him and I and maybe he should.  I can't handle jealousy.  I can't handle walking on egg shells with new people in my life because it might upset him or make him all jealous.  Thursday was yet another interesting day.  I wanted to prove to Dave that I can be that best friend he's seeking.  I ran in to Larry Scoot and he asked me who's Durango I was driving.  I told him Dave's.  I also told Larry about Mike Hartery.  Told him that he was living at Megan's and sleeping in her room.  Told him what a piss poor job he did on the mustang.  He told me that Mike was getting ready to throw a transmission in Boch's truck (Boch being 18 year old Megan's Dad and an ex boyfriend of mine).  So I immediately went over to go see Mr. Boch.  He's all mad at me cause i'm bringing this to him like I'm an enemy al the sudden.  Last time I saw him he told me "Katy, you know why I love you so much, you loved me when I was fat and you loved me when I was thin all the same."  Then I find out that he told dave I was a lying cheating whore Dyke.  When I was with him I never cheated on him and I never lied to him and I was there for him thru his whole divorce.  I am definately not a dyke.  Thou the thought has crossed my mind.  I was so hurt by that,  I couldn't help but cry.  Dave did go talk to Larry Scott and Mr. Boch about hartery about missing car parts and stolen money.  So, dave was having a shitty day too.  Of course Thursday is a Duke Obrien night.  By the time we got down to Crystal Lake to pick up parts from Joe and have some grub neither one of us felt much like going out.  Chris and I got in to it on the phone on the way down to Crystal Lake.  He was all ready drunk at 7:30. He'd been drinking since like 5:30.  I'm so done with him.  I told him I talk to Linda like 5-6 times a day.  I talk to him maybe 5 times a week.  It was one of those days I was doubting who my friends were.  Instead of going to Duke's me and Dave decided to come home have a comfortably cozy night making brownies.  Friday sucked too.  I was livid!  I came home after a very long day at work and crashed so Dave and I could go out.  Slept until like 7:00 still hadn't heard form him so I called.  Him and his mom were fighting so he didn't feel like going out.  I think he hung up pn me like 3 times.  Somehow I can't stay mad at Dave no matter how hard I try.  So come like 8:30 he finally makes the decision that he wasn't going out.  In the mean time I ran down to let the dogs out and Bill was home.  So I called Tama to see if he at least called her since he didn't call me.  She said yes.  That made me even more mad.  Because he's fucking her and not me I don't deserve a phone call.  Tama actually said Kate it's a little different when you are fucking someone verses someone that he pays to let the dogs out.  She said that and Kelly told me they are not my dogs so I'm done.  Until I get an apology from Bill for making me deal with Kelly and can prove to me I'm more than someone that just lets out the dogs then I'm not going over there anymore.  Tama Is really high drama.  Bill is a self centered assmunch.  I dropped mine and Brian's key off with a little note stating that $80 is a slap in the face.  So just whatever.  Brian came over and we cuddled up and went to bed it Was kind of nice.  HOWEVER, he asked me where to dig out for an herb garden so I told him.  I've been home 45 minutes he's nowhere to be found.  I'm so sick and tired of his inability to be motivated to do anything.  I can't handle it anymore.  It literally drives me insane.  On a happier note:  Allie girl call me. Everytime I call you the line is busy or no one is home.  Sunday I had to work finally got some over time in.  Brian was working on the day lillies when i got here.  Then we went Garage saling.  Going to mom's for dinner.  Then putting together mike's puter.  My whole site will be blogs.. So stay tuned!

      Ok a lot has happened since my last blog.  Bill went out of town for two weeks so I've been flipping Tyrone and Dakota being at the house.  I had given Kelly a key to  help me let the dogs out because Tama said she wouldn't as long as Bill doesn't change the locks.  So since he once again didn't change the locks on the house I had no choice but to give Kelly a key.  First day was fine second day she told me tnot to go get Dakota groomed because he was not my dog.  I reminded her that I've been letting thesedogs out since she left.  Then I hung up on her.  I am not quite sure who has more respect for me kelly or bill.  I'd like to think Bill but then again he put me thru having to put up with Tama being pissed and Kelly.  I swear all he thinks about is himself and not about any reprocussions of his actions or inaction for that matter.  Friday night me and Daave hung out.  We went down to Crystal Lake to see Tommy and then over to Kohl's.  I'm in 12 stretch slim fits!!!!!!!!!!!  I haven't been a 12 since high school.  Went to Friday's for dinner.  Then we ended up going to 94 after that.  Had an awesome time!  Music was decent.  Everyone seemed to be in a good mood.  I saw Danielle and John and Becky (Dani's GF).  Of course our favorite flaming faggot Kevin was there.  I love him so much :). Anyway ended up coming back to the house and he crashed over.  Went to work I think I got in like 35 hours.  Didn't have to work Sunday.  Linda stopped by on Satyurday and picked up Chris's ladder.  Saturday night, after Brian put Stephen down, me him and Tama went to Fridays for dinner, again.  Tama was majorly hitting on the 21 year old waiter.  I laughed so hard when he told her how old he was.  He was very cute tho.  Sunday was national smokers New Year's.  Happy New Year all you potheads.  Mom and I put in like 3 hours in the house.  We cleaned off all the windows and sills.  She bought me a ton of pop.  We went shopping for curtain rods.  Put a few Misc boxes away.  I found all my kitchen stuff up in the loft. We did Sunday dinner at Mom and Dad's.  We had Lamb, asparagus, and red potatoes.  Finished off that Boston cream torte I bought a few weeks ago, for dessert.  Brian and I left but before we left My dad decided to call me Ave Jr.  I was so mad.  I even called him and told him that it hurt my feelings.  I try so hard not to be like that thing.  Anyway, we left and came to the house.  Had some fucking awesome sex.  David called and wanted to stop by and pick his stuff up.  His grandma passed away on Sunday, so he was not in good form.  He looked nice tho.  He looks good in Sage green.  I'm gonna have to remember that. :).  Then we proceeded to have really awesome sex again! Then went to bed.  ok a few good lines I heard oer the weekend:  The only one ever born perfect was Jesus Christ and they crusified him. - Ann Marie  Boobcheck will be going to jail!  Don't entertain other people's stupidity.  Chris called me and woke me up today.  He's all worried because Linda is pissed off.  I keep telling him to not take people in to AJ's Donna goes in there and she'll run and tell Linda.  Sure enough that's what happened.  Took another girl in to AJ's.  I hope to God it was Star.  I really need to tell him to fuck off.  I'm sick of tell him why I'm mad at him.  You know that song about "what good is a love affair if we argue cuss and fight"  that's what we do.  He's so not worth my time.  Besides I  like Linda now that I've had a chance to talk to her.  Brian is working.  David and Craig are at the game.  I'm going to go over to Sally's pick up some hair color do my hair.  Go over to mom's and drop off her pedal for the sewing machine.

      Been doing a lot of thinking.  Not sure how I ogt tim eto do that.  I feel like everyone is pulling on my sleeves for time.  Some I don't mind.  I'm really starting to get irritated with Brian.  He's just around 24-7.  I Don't have time to think.  I think tonight I'm just gonna tell him I need a little space.  Will give me a chance to clear my head, figure out these feelings I am having for David, get comfortably numb in MY house by MYSELF (and Dakota).    I'm very torn right now.  I love Brian but there is so much more to life than what he wants to offer.  But I know there's something going on for David too.  I feel secure around him.  I know nothing will happen to me.  I feel the same with Brian it's just different.  I know David can offer me a lot more than Brian.  I need time to deal with all this.  I need just time to think.  I feel like I am going to explode.  If one more person asks me to do something I'm gonna loose it.

      well.. Lots happened over the weekend.  Friday night me, Gloria and David went down to Dave and buster's in Lombard to meet up with Cher.  We all ended up gettting quesadillas.  Some strange reason Gloria thought I'd order fish.  ACK like that would happen.  Shell fish and salmon only for me thanks.  Cher was wearing this really cute skirt and top outfit.  I got a nice little back rub from her while we were there.  Saturday.  Wel, i'm not going to get in to much detail but let's just say me, Cher and Dave went to 94.  OMG did we have a great time.  We stopped at Superb and Crossroads on the way home if that gives you any ideas.  She wore another school girl outfit for me.  Man I was just in seventh heaven.  Sunday I went and helped Dave put up the fence on his lot then we went down to the city.  Stopped at the Alley, Taboo Taboo, some had shop and then came home.  Brian was here when we got here.  I had to go let out the dogs so Brian and I did that then came home and went to bed.    He left me this letter when he left today.. He can tell I am being distant.  Not sure why I am doing that to him.  I'm just looking for something that is not there.  I just don't know what it is.  I do know what I want so I'm just going to throw it out there and see what I get.  In a man: Handsome, employed (not by mom and dad either), driver's license and own car.  Must be ok with a bi girlfriend.  Non smoker, occasional drinker (or willing ot hang out at a bar for an evening), a decent pool player would be a nice bonus, must have a passion for SOMETHING, must be family oriented, children are ok (as long as the mother is ok with you dating, I don't need psychos), mentally, physically, moniarily stable, a functional pothead would be a plus but definately not neccessary.  In a woman: I need someone that understands I am not lesbian,  I'm not going to take you home to mom and dad until we know each other REALLY well, All the above is included.  please send all requests to  urlLink aranetta@yahoo.com

      Ok I have a new house number so anyone interested should call me on the cell to get it.    I was listening to the radio the other day and an interesting question was brought to mind.  Now that we are adults what should we know how to do but just can't figure it out.  I called the radio station on this one and told them I am TV challenged.  I can figure out how to hook up the VCR to the tv or just one component to the tv but if it's more than one component I'm totally lost.  Then trying to find ONE all in one remote that operates EVERYTHING is a whole differnet challenge.  I saw Ronnie Wednesday night.  That made my week.  Something about that girl drives me insane.  I took 15 points in pool Wednesday.  I hung out with Dave and Gloria last night we went to Dave and Buster's down in Lombard to meet up with cher. I hope she comes and sees me today.  My gut feeling tells me she's going to blow me off.  She was being SOOOOOOOO cute.  Should have seen the outfit she had on.  a CUTE little plaid skirt and a really cute black top with patten leather shoes.  YUM!!! I so badly wanted to kidnap her and bring her home with me.  Then we went to Sheridan News so Dave and I could buy a new bong.  Then ended up at Tobin's before we took her home.  oh yeah and Dial up sucks balls.  Just for the record.    I think Allie and I are going to make a team blog.  Anyone interested should  urlLink Email me

      I gave you my heart.   I didn't give it to you in pieces. I didn't give it to you to break.  I gave it to you to take.  You never gave me yours.  I was always waiting for it. I suppose I always will.   I hope you got your thrill.  Loving me wasn't enough so you had to go for her. I can't say I blame you.   Because I did too. I can't even say I didn't have a clue.   I just thought for once you meant it. Boy, wasn't i the fool. I thought you would really care. Don't come near me, don't you dare.  Don't come to me crying.  I've cried too many times. I can't handle your cries. You've told me too many lies.  Let me go.   Don't hold me tight. Look away. don't ask me to stay.

      Friday, umm what did i do friday?  Funny musta got stoned and forgot LOL.  Oh Glor stopped by with the kids early afternoon and then Jerrylyn stopped by for a sec.  Oh then it started storming out really bad like LATE Friday night.  So for old times sake me and Brian went down by the lake over by Frigate's and sat and watched this awesome storm roll in.  the rain missed us so we got the most beautiful lightning storm.  It was quite poetic.  I wrote a poem about it i'll post it if i can find it.  Poor Linda, I feel so bad for her.  Chris was at Star's house until at least midnight on Friday.  He had the balls to bring Star by the house to bring her some vicodin.  Chris hasn't charged Star any money.  Linda is furious.  Saturday Me, Brian and David went to Great America and then ordered up some Za.  Mike and Candy swung by.  Tama and Bill stopped by about midnightish.    I guess you should all know that Kelly was admitted to the psych ward.  Not sure if she's out or what.  I hope she gets the help she needs.  Sunday, Brian got off work then went to my mom's and started dinner.  I brought laundry over and got that started.  He made the most wonderful lasagne I think I've ever had.  Candy made a red velvet cake that was to die for.  I got my mom a low rise bird bath and a small statue for her garden.  Mike is working on putting a glass top on my mom's old sewing machine table.  My dad wrote my mother a really mushy letter it was so sweet!  Brian and I left there and went to Kmart to get an all in one remote, smoked a little and now I'm heading to bed.  Love you guys!

      OMG last night ROCKED!  I had such a good time.  I think the whole group did. Me, David, Jill (yum), Chris (her bf), Schirm (kinko's), Tommy, Fluff, Josh's woman - Josh (yum) and the jagermiester girls, and do i really need to say yum to them? No but i will. I got to talking to Schirm for the first time.  I thought he was with Jill all this time.  Come to find out he's not.  So i think i'm going to change energy to him for a little bit see where i can get with him.  He's young.  We celebrated his 21st birthday last night, but maybe young is what i need so i don't feel so damn old.

      Well let's see last night sucked!  I got off school Dave was here.  I knew he was having a bad day cause he hardly spoke two words to me except for don't go with Arlyn.  I'm like what the fuck.  Took me all I had not to cry.  Almost succeeded.  We talked a lot of things out.  Nothing I want to go in to detail about.  After I left I felt like shit.  I realized I hurt when we fight because he has a place in my heart that is scaring the hell out of me and I'm too afraid to have that space missing by him not being around.  I'm trying to prove to him every time i see him that I'm grateful for what he's done for me.  I'm not sure if I am succeeding or not.  I told him that, as I started crying.  I figured by then he's gonna think I'm nuts.  I still haven't heard from him yet today so I think he's pulling that defense thing again.  I told him I'm hurt that he's blocking me out.  I mean I just layed it all on the line.  So we'll see if he'll call me.  I'm not going to call him if our friendship means as much to me as it does to him then he'll call me.  I caught Chris at Star's  SUCKED ASS.  My heart dropped out of my chest.  I mean deep down I knew it was going to happen.  I was just so hurt it was a night him and I had plans.  REVENGE IS A DISH BEST SERVED COLD!

      Talked to Allie on the phone tonight.  Love talking to her.  Allie call me and remind me to send you that disk.  I need your address.    Talked to Arlyn in a text message most of the way to the Dells on Friday.  I think he wants a regular thing again.  I know you all will yell at me for this but IF that's right then I'm leaving Brian.  I'm happiest when I'm around Arlyn.  Brian calms me down and is in my heart, but I REALLY want arlyn.  I'm gonna do everything in my power to get him back.  You all can yell at me all you want.  But the fact of thematter is i can't stop thinking about him.  I miss us.  I miss the fun we had.  I miss the awesome sex.  He's changed alot now that he gets to see his son.  So we'll see if he thinks I'm worth one last chance.  I finished up the top of the quilt for Bonnie's daughter.  I got it all pinned together and started sewing the back to the front.  I'm a little better than half way done with that part.  Then sewing the binding and then finishing off the binding.

Richard stopped by and then Big David stopped by.  Me, Kat, David and Richard went to dinner.  I went and picked up E in the middle of dinner.  Came back to the house.  Brought Linda the rest of her stuff.  Brought Marla stuff.  Picked up the Kitten OMG is he the cutest little thing I've ever seen.  Mostly orange with beige.  Then we went out to the tatoo parlor out on 120 called krazy pumpkin.  Little Dave was getting his arm worked on.  Big Dave and I took Kat home about midnight.  Came back here and had a vodka and lemonade and played with the kitten for a while.  THEN Little dave stopped by.  Of course Big Dave and I had porn on when we got here so little dave walked in to us feeling no pain watching porn.  So I was in the middle of a dave sammich.  Loved EVERY minute of it.  Little dave suprised the hell out of me.  He got very comfortable very fast :).  Big Dave spent te night i think little dave went home about 4:30am.  For the record....

      ok so since i keep getting yelled at ablout not blogging i guess i should.  To all that talk to allie (NNancy) on a regualr basis her puters are messed u pso she won't be online for a while but she's all good.  Too much has happened last few days.  Dave has apologized for being a complete dick the last few days.  Friday night i stayed home pretty much.  Satuday night Dave and i hung out and went up to kenosha.    Sunday morning we went to the car show at Lake County Fair grounds.  I found my brother a matchbox model of his 23 ford t bucket.  It was identical  minus the lantern tail lights and grey interior.  I must tell you about sunday night.  Make sure u are smoking or drinking anything cause u will laff so hard!  So me and Frank went down to this bar in the city it's a girl bar with kareoke on sunday nights.  What could be better right?  Well i thought my night couldn't get any better until i got home.    The night gets better  We got back and decided we didn't want to be there.. So me, Brian and Frank decided Joyce's.  So we get to Joyces and Frank beat us there and was sitting there talking to Jessie (male)... Last I knew was Kevin's bitch.  So Frank moves by us and Jessie sits on the other side of Frank.. So at the bar we had Bonnie, Older Frank, Arlyn, Me, Brian, Frank, Jessie, 2 guys i didn't know.  Jessie quickly disappears in to the bathroom.. i asked frank where Jessie went, he's like i don't know his stuff's still here.  The other guy I didn't know disappeared too.  Bonnie noticed and went in the bathroom and sure enough they were fucking in the bathroom.  I really wish i was kidding about this.    David walks in  The night gets better yet  Kevin calls looking for the missing boyfriend Jessie.  The convo goes as follows:  Joyce: Hello Pj's park Inn Kevin: Is Jessie there: Joyce: Jessie isn't allowed in here anymore Kevin: why not Joyce:   Bonnie: Because we caught him fucking another guy in the bathroom Kevin:  Just keep it on the down low please (whatever that means) Bonnie: yeah I'll keep it on the downlow Kevin    We are all laffing so hard we can't breathe  The night gets better yet  Jessie returns to the bar not understanding he's not allowed in there.  Bonnie escorts him away fromthe property while jessie is yellin " you are all a bunch of stupid girls"  and bonnie goes "if u are a gay man why are u fucking em if they are all stupid girls"  Frank took him home, but was online when i got hom  15 minutes later.  More to come!

      YOU KNOW YOU'RE FROM CHICAGO IF. . .  You know what the phone number for Empire Carpet is!  Your living room is called the "front room." (pronounced frontroom)  You don't pronounce the "s" at the end of Illinois,   and you become irate at people who do.  You measure distance in minutes (especially "from the city"),   and everything is pretty much 15 minutes away.  You have no problem spelling or pronouncing "DesPlaines."  Your school classes were canceled because of the cold weather.  Your school classes were canceled because of the hot weather.  You've switched from heat to air conditioning in the same day.  Your grocery stores don't have sacks; they have bags.  You end your sentences with prepositions: "Where's my coat at?" or "If you go to the mall, I wanna go with," or "Come by and pick me up."  Your idea of a great sandwich is when the meat is twice as big  as the bun, it has everything on it, and a slice of dill pickle is on the side.  You always carry jumper cables in your car.  You drink "pop."  You understand that I-290, I-90, I-94, and I-294 are all different highways.  You know the names of the interstates: Stevenson, Kennedy, Eisenhower, Dan Ryan, and the Edens, but you call them all "expressways."  You refer to anything south of I-80 as "Southern Illinois."  You refer to Lake Michigan as "The Lake."  You refer to Chicago as "The City."  The "Super Bowl" refers to one specific game in a series of 35 played in January of 1985.  No matter where you are, when you hear the term "Downtown," you immediately assume they're talking about downtown Chicago.  You have two favorite football teams: The Bears, and anyone who beats the Packers!  You read "The Trib."  You drive to the North suburbs by taking "The Outer Drive" even though no such road exists.  You think 35 degrees is great weather to wash your car!  You know what goes on a Chicago Style Hot Dog.  You know what Chicago Style Pizza REALLY is.  You know why they call Chicago "The Windy City."  You understand what "lake-effect" means.  You know the difference between Amtrak and Metra, and know which station they end up at. (Do note the preposition.)  You ride the "L."  You can distinguish among the following area codes: 847, 630,773,708,312,&815.  You respond to the question "Where are you from with a "side."    Example:"WEST SIDE," "SOUTH SIDE," or "NORTH SIDE."  You wear gym shoes, not sneakers.  And, the CHICAGO CLASSIC: You have at some time in your life,    used your furniture to guard your parking spot in winter.  You know where the post office is.  You measure distance by how long it takes you to get there not by mileage.  You've use the last name O'mally while giving a history lesson.  You remember when "Da Bulls" were actually good.  You know what the miracle mile is.  When someone says "the airport" you assume O'hare (even though you know there are 2)  You understand that the far left lane is really 75 mph as opposed to the 55 mph posted limit.  You know where and how much each toll booth is.

      I got myself a new car.  It's an '89 Thunderbird super coupe.  It's got a 3.8 super charge 5 speed stick.  Can you say "holy cow fast"?  It's nice to have a car worth dumping some money in to.  I joined S.S.C.O.A. Super Coupe Club of america on Dave's recommendation.  Very cool club to be in for a gear head!  Deals with strictly '89 to '95 thunderbird super coupes.  Kat is buying my regal once we get it running  .  Aol sucks donkey balls.  Incase anyone hasn't heard me say that in a while.  When I sign on and check my billing it says I'm on unlimited.  When I sign off it says i'm on unlimited but somehow i'm paying per minute and they charged my father $764 for apr and another $226 from may to current.  So after an hour on the phone Wednesday night and so far a half hour on the phone today nothing's been resolved.  I wonder how aol is able to stay in business.. Maybe by charging people $764 and never disputing it.  Who knows.  Tuesday I felt like I was in Michigan and having an anxiety attack.  It was scary couldn't calm down no matter how much I smoked.  I hate that feeling.  Too afraid to go to a dr. and for them to tell me that I have to be on meds forever.  I think I like the whole self medication theory more.  Brian's been working with David at his mom's this week doing some landscaping.  He's doing brakes on Linda's van.  So as long as he's working I'm gonna try my hardest not to hound on him.  IT's hard cause I feel like an over grown babysitter.  We talked alot last night and kissed and made up.  So all is well.  Maria called this morning.  She might be coming up this weekend from Michigan.  So if I don't answer my phone u know why :).  Kat might be coming over today but I haven't heard from her yet.  Saturday the gang is going up to 94.  Peter hasn't been to a gay bar here in the states yet.  So he'll see what friendly really means :).    As I'm sitting here on hold with AOhell, for the last half hour, I'm reminded of the word Patience.    Oh yeah everyone call my mom and wish her a happy birthday.  It's tomorrow!  We are doing a sunday dinner for her.  She loves that kind of stuff.  David just called and said Kat had a wet dream about him and I I'm VERY curious as to what that was about!

      I know it's been like forever since i've blogged.  I guesss I just feel like I've talked to everyone so often that I really don't need to blog as often.  I'm just lazy yeah that's it.  Lots has happened in the last week so I thought I'd catch ya up.   David got his house back after Boobcheck and Kyle moved out.  I think I got  myself 2 snowmobiles out of the deal YIPPY.  We threw out 34 bags of garbage.  I think we got the raccoon drunk.  We threw out the bags and the next morning there was a dead raccoon in front of the house.  ANYWAY....  Peter showed up like thursday.  He's from Germany and doesn't have to leave until september.  He's a sweety.  Starting to loosen up a bit.   Kat broke up with Nick on Saturday.  Me, Brian, Rich, David, Dave, Samantha (YUM) and Michelle (Kat's best friend) all went and helped her move out and move in to David's.  So David. Peter and Kat are living there.  I got 2 kittens since I last blogged.  One is orange/beige tabby and one dark chocolate brown half siamese.  The tabby we named Toby.  I need suggestions on the chocolate brown.  The Durango is about up on the mileage, YEAH!!! David has a white Tbird that I am going to buy as long as there isn't a  blown seal on the thing.  I found a plug I needed to hook up the cb in the house.  So I'm gonna have Brian go over to mom's and get my radio.  Maybe if we are ambitious potheads we can go up to the top of Esler's roof and tear down the cb antenna.  If not maybe Al will let me have his.  My mother is being a saint.  Rose is up for a week.  So I think I am going to go swimming with her today and try to work out my back.  Then maybe take her to gurnee mills tomorrow.  I gotta go pick up Ashley (Chris and Linda's daughter) today.  Started doing click for money programs.  If any of you are interested you can start   urlLink Here  It's WWW.Wonderemails.com and please use the aranetta as reference so I get paid for you clicking.  So now that I've caught everyone up.. I'll try to be better about blogging, I promise!

      This weekend was so nice!  The wedding was very cool.  Everyone got along.  No fights that weren't able to be resolved. Brian looked DAMN sexy.    You know there was a point in time where someone's best friend would call them more than just for weed.  Even after the best friend offered them a cell phone to make a call or two... maybe that wasn't enough of a hint

      So we went up north over the weekend.  I realized a few things.  My father kept correcting Curtis's Grandson from calling him Pat to Mr. Lannan.  I've realizes that most of my parents friends that I've grown up with I don't call mr. and mrs. anymore.   It's Mrs. Sweiton and Bob, Mr. G and Mrs. G, Sharon or Mrs. and Mr. Salemi.  Strange, I would never think of calling my parents friends by thier first name as a child.  Boy how times have changed!  A 9 year old that considers my father his menotr os to speak calls him Pat I would hae been slapped at that age calling Bob Bob.   I am almost done with David's quilt I got one short side to finish and I have to stitch in a ditch it.    Stopped up and saw my children today oh ya and gloria :) can't forget her!  Brandon comes RUNNING full speed down the street to give me a hug.  He's such a lover boy! Britt thinks that I'm gonna give her money and a cat.  Steven is just...... Steven... LOL  If ya all bring me money I can get more and sell it for less...   Anyway... i have 300 emails to go thru tomorrow so if u can't get thru call brian's cell

      So we decided a few things first off the club name is going to be moonlight horizons... There ya go rich (Love ya).    The wedding date is June 12th... That's gonna be a small intimate wedding at mom and dad's and wedding party good friends, immedate family aunts and uncles. any kids that are in the wedding and everyone else can meet us over at the reception.    Christmas gifts are in the works all ready na na na na na na...   Brian wants a quilt for when we go sit outside at night.. like i don't have enough going on and u know i'll run right in to doing that for him since he asks so little of me.  We are going up to the farm for some much needed grounding and pavement beating  I swear i'm gonna get at least 2 more sides done to david's quilt  So anyway everyone can just give me money... I'm not registering anywhere cause i really don't need anything.

      Going to Carl's 40 and Lori's birthday.  Should be fun.. drinking with Lori.. Never thought I'd see the day.  I can't wait to see the look on her face when she sees the ring.  She's gotta be the first one i tell.  She is my favorite cousin after all.  She jsut asked me last night who was going to get married first me or Mike.  It was so hard to bite my lip.  So I decided since today's her birthday and i don't even really like carl all that much we are showing up to celebrate lori's birthday.  Gonna sit and drink with her and dale.. Screw Carl.  Only reason whyu I talk to him is shelly is way too cool and McKenzie will be the flower girl :)

      I've been praying and praying for just a small little break in teh financial situation.  Just a small one!  Instead I got a huge one.  My online friends know how I feel about "CERTAIN" club owners of the swinging lifestyle.  We will call her peaches for idenity purposes.  Well.. So the question goes how do you make peaches poor and you rich all at the same time?  Super easy.. Open up another club on the same nights she's running hers.  Plain and simple!  Well was not so simple in reality.  I finally talked to Steve over at Private Affairs in Dekalb and him and I are going partners on Fridays parties being run out of there.  There are no for sure set in stone plans as of right now.  But we are looking at November being the opening month.  I will use his facility on a percentage.  I can't believe he actually said yes.  Then again he' all about cash flow and so am I.  So anyways... that's HUGE news!   Jeff you were right about one thing... Revenge is a dish best served cold! It's also much more fun!

      Biggest news of the month!!! We're ENGAGED!!! That's right read it and weep boys.  He took me off the market!! NEENER NEENER NEENER!  Gonna be June 12th, 2004 At Mom and Dad's is the wedding and Brian's sister's for the reception.  Wedding Party as follows  Maid of Honor: 	G.L.O.R.I.A!!!!!!!!!!! Bride's Maid:	Allie  Best Man:	Bill Groomsman:	Todd or David not sure  Ok other than that.. whatelse has gone on this week??  Rent still isn't paid.  I got a Worm on my puter.  Mcafee actually was the only one to detect the worm.  They have a small program that detects these nasty email worms.  download Stinger.exe from Mcafee.com It fixed my puter and that was a damn task I had a bunch of these little bastards. Found 5 total!  Nick is just about out of this picture and when he is we are gonna have a ding dong the witch is dead party.  I think Rich has a girlfriend cause I haven't heard form him in a week.   I'm so happy for you honey I really am.  You deserve someone as awesome as you are! I really hope to God she doesn't put me in a position where I have to like put the fear of best friend in her.  Doug is OLD LOLOLOLOLOL :P  Oh I fixed my aol home page!  Aol Sucks huge as donkey balls. Check this out!  For $3 a month you can have McAfee Virus protection provided by aol. The Largest known Virus to mankind teams up with one of the worse antivirus protection (minus this last little stinger.exe thing).  I mean really how much more ironic can you get?  People are actually stupid enough to PAY aol for thier services more then they all ready do?  Shouldn't that be a part of your online service.  I mean hell they still haven't fixed the billing issues totally so there's $1300 at thier disposal for antivirus protection.  Further more..... Why is it when you do keyword live help one option isn't hometown aol?  I mean really when u sit there and wait for someone to answer you then they speak very little english.  Then the "tech support" goes (get this) "I viewed your aol hometown page and your pictures aren't loading" So I said "no shit if they were I wouldn't have asked you how to fix it!" and then he said there is an aol deptartment that handles this issue.  My question here is if they make you type in your question why did he waste 10 minutes of my time before he told me this and why isn't there a damn option for aol hometown? An durther more... Why would aol need a whole department separate from tech support??? The answer is simple... During the day "tech support" is indonesia... Way to go AMERICA ONLINE!... There for they cannot assess this problem because they don't understand enugh english to true "tech support".   If you want AMERICAN billing or tech support call tech support after midnight and you are then in the Washington building.  This is   And don't be fooled Sprint's billing is indonesia.. But don't even get me started with that!

      I know I haven't blogged about my trip to texas and I apologize.  I'll tell you this part only because it's relavant.  I had a dream that Tony was online and told me he was coming home while I was in Texas.   Now I haven't talked to him since.  When I did talk to him I asked him where he'd been for the last week.  His answer to me was "Making life changing decisions".  I knew what it was.  I was so happy when his response was.. I'm coming home!  Today we are meeting up with the Rev.  and my prayers were finally answered with Tony moving home.  There is a God and for once he is smiling on me!

      So last night Glo dragged me to this 10 year class reunion icebreaker at sharky's. Everyone looks exatly the same for the most part.  Julie Russo was there was nice to see her, Ann Philyaw, Sean Gillette, Amy Jo Welzen, Bobby Jo Summers, and of course every snobby ass bitch that was in high school was there.  So me and Glo left about 10:30 and went to Joyce's.  She sat and talked to some guy for like 2 and a 1/2 hours Go Glo!!!!! I just sat back and enjoyed irritating Bonnie.  I thought maybe Justin would have showed up but never did.  I was really expecting him but it would have been nice.    Shopping list: An eletric coffee cup warmer so i can melt candles (idea from the unfucker) Bathroom towels a toilet bowl cover a rug for the toilet maybe a rug for the sink  I'm gonna attempt to put together brian's puter this weekend but have to stop over at fat danny's first and pick up his kick ass case.  I wanna finish up the cookies I started making yesterday  start a load of laundry over at mom's.  The cat's pissed on something in the bathroom so i have to wash EVERYthin and I had all my fabric stored in there so it's all gotta get washed.  Damn not being able to smell.. It's embarrassing.  I got the recipe from Joyce for apple shots.  So I alread made the apple juice. Now just gotta add the alcohol.. Maybe I'll call Candy and Mike go out for dinner with them if I have time.  I have to pick up a drill gun from mom and dad to make these really cool candle holders with tin cans i saw on while you were out. Maybe attemp to sand down my night stand.  We'll see

      So last night we cleaned the foyer.  That was a huge ass project all I kept saying to myself when I walked in was how I used to yell at Gloria for doing that cause it looked like a hillbilly lived there.  So anyway it was cleaned.  I made this chicken and Rice dinner.  We sat outside and ate next to the bonfire.  Had some incredible sex and went to bed.  FYI if anyone ever puts me on these trading spaces shows decides that pink and purple are good colors for me they will be disowned!

      So I decided that the color is celedon green.. Kind of like a sagey sea myst. I decided on the menu.  Roast Lamb, potatoes, corned beef and cabbage, maybe chicken. I am going to try my hardest to wear m mother's dress I really hope that it fits. The wedding is at mom's. I think the reception is Kolby barn. I decided that the prayer is going to be a part of blessing candles that each person there will have. In front of them.  The lighter of the candles for the table will get a centerpiece candle.  The candles will be in shot glasses and gel and teh middle will be a fish owl like glass with gel.

      Today was rather productive I must say.  9am start!  Organized my dj tiesto collection.  That wasn't an easy project.  I had to rename about 100 files.  Delete the tag and retag them all and make a new list. Started to download the acdc prerelease among many others!  Started in one corner and worked my way around  Counter top clean.  Stove Clean.  Dishes done and put away. Kitchen table cleaned.  Kitchen was swept and mopped.  Living room was vaccuumed. Desk was cleaned.  Corner glass piece in the bedroom was put on the ledge. Killed a  bumble  bee.  Had HGTV on all day and was talking to Allie all day.  Cable internet rocks! Oh yeah and my phone is back on.  I'll post wedding plans thus far as soon as i have 10 minutes.  Oh and best of all enjoyed a 420 break all to myself because Brian started working for Dad today and I packed my own bowl.  To those who know me well that's a difficult task.

      You know today was one of those days  If it could go wrong it did but somehow all worked out for the better of everyone.  Started out by Larry calling me about a script.  After HOURS of fucking around with it we have a working script.    Rachel came over and I died her hair she took a shower, lent me some money and left.  We had a miscommunication with Doug about a time frame issue so Texas didn't happen.  That forced me to make a few phone calls and FINALLY Edder pulls thru and finds me some kick ass stuff.  I mean 3 hits fucked up stuff.  Absolutely impressive.  It's a strand of white widow I believe.        So we were out in Gurnee to pick that up and we had to run to David's to pick up a 98 SE disk from greg.  So we stopped by at a friend's house in Island Lake.  Let him have some.  That was the true confession of how awesome this stuff was he smelled it as I walked in.  We went grocery shopping came home started trying to fix Brian's puter and was unsuccessful.  I started backing up my full collections of artists.  If they weren't full they were gone.  I was almost in tears.  I hate having to reformat.  I'm gonna reformat and put 98 back on here i'm so sick of the load up time and shut down time i could scream.  Anyway, Brian made some chili and mac n cheese.  So ther is fresh Chili in the house.. I don't want anyone yelling at me that they didn't know.  Bill stopped by and jerimiah earlier in the day.    I watched a new clean sweep and a new trading spaces and both episodes TOTALLY rocked.  That chick from the changing spaces on BBCA was on my god is she fucking hotter then hell in july!  Anyway, They did this totally kick ass thing with the ceiling that I will do in my house but kick it up a notch. The walls were a eggplant purple witha goldish looking ceiling.  The WALL color went up to the top of the walls and on to the ceiling by like a foot leaving the rest of the ceiling open and gold.  I was so blown away by how taller it made the room look that i decided to do the same thing but instead of just a foot out and leaving the rest blank I'm gonna do every other foot in squares in green so the trim will be green and 1 foot of green the next will be white square then a green square.  THEN do squiggly lines in the middle. That will be a 3d effect. The green border of the squiggly lines will have glowy stars.  What do you think of them apples?  I went and saw tony on saturday OMG he is hotter then hell in june and july combined!  He's mine Glor sorry I waited 25 years for him u can't have him!  Saw Stephy and Kath Saturday too.  Surrounded by awesome looking people I love my life right now.  So things didn't workout QUITE like i wanted them too but they worked out!  Oh yeah and had another mind blowing sexual tension releaser with brian and you guy wonder why I keep him around..

      So this weekend was I think THE longest weekend EVER.  Brian was up north with mom, dad, and Steven.  I went to magnify with David.. Round tripped it... There is a whole lot of nothingness... I mean like 200 miles of NOTHING.  Justin I don't know how u do that every other weekend... I give you a lot of credit!  Anyway... Met Evan and Beth and Jason and Russ and um the guy on the couch.. I don't know what his name was LOL.  Anyway.. We got in about 6am and then loaded up the regal and took it over to Pete's.  Glor brought me some really nice weed.   Today is clean desk and kitchen mom clean style.. We got the cats new indoor formula food so maybe they won't  be so stinky and a sifter litter pan thing, and get this a CHILI pepper cat nip refillable time,  and went to lunch so time to work I got about 2 hours of cleaning to do I think.  David and I are gonna go check out center club work out facility... So I'll let you guys know what that's like... Thinking about winter coming and no great america to walk so I'll swim instead... Thanks Todd :)

      LOL ok I finally figured out why I love gloria so much.. We are so different on relationship levels of just about every kind it's strange that we are really best friends.  Our taste in guys and views on sexuality are so completely different I realize what I am supposed to act like... She's my voice of sexual reasoning.  She does everything I'm SUPPOSED to do..  I feel like she's the angel and i'm teh devil so how is it that 2 people so complete different in sexual issues are best friends... strange, but i love it just the way it is and wouldn't change it for the world

And it's gonna change, just as soon as I become an adult and get some power of my own.    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Before I write what I am about to write this is not about anything or anyone in particular.  Just getting it on paper eases my mind about people behavior and how I react to it.  There is no one insinuated or any situations in particular that I am referring to... This is just how I see things.  Well I've come to a decision in my never ending pursuit of learning to know someone.  Why is it u are afraid when u know someone too well.. You learn their behavior.. You've learned their body language... You've learned their habit and desires.  You've learned all this to come to some sort of a friendship understanding... Sometimes you are dead on the same page and other times u assuming things that are so far off base u wonder why u spent so much time wondering things instead of just asking them.  You sit there and wonder what u did wrong.. Did u say something offensive?? Did u give bad advice??? Did they read into something that wasn't meant to be read in to?  Take something the wrong way??? Instead of just asking the person u go crazy trying to analyze the situation.  The truth of the matter is I'm beginning to realize that I'm not a great communicator...  I think I assume WAY to much about people, and never give my opinion a second thought.  So I am going to make a diligent effort to not assume too much about a person... The moment I do they change... The second I think I can trust someone I mean FULLY trust them 100% they will snap and make u rethink every friendship u have.  I'm not saying this to scare you guys.  I'm saying it as a warning...   If you are reading this this next line doesn't apply to you...  I have lost 2 dear friends in the last six months due to the assumption that what I said stay in that message and wasn't copied and pasted for the whole world to see.  I have, only one time in my life, done that to deliberately... Pasted something so they would end up regretting hurting a friend.  I will never EVER do it again!    I have had time over this last year to really analyze myself.  Figure out what I've done wrong in past relationships.  What I can do better for me and Brian so the same thing doesn't happen.  I have figured out that I have put a life time in to my friends and they aren't going anywhere.  These fly by nights are just that.  I don't need any more Friends then what I all ready have.  No reason to open my door for more hurt... I have assumed so much that I'm not sure how to start back at ground level with people that don't mean as much to me as the people that I have active in my life right now.  So unresolved issues are unresolved issues and I am going to do my best to bury the past in the past.  Keep the friends I have in the present in the present and the future and worry about only those that I know really care about me.  Everyone else can go fuck themselves!  If u are in my life now and using me up I will find you hunt you down myself.. So if this is the category you are in right now then be gone.  For all those people that have run me to the ground, used me up for every last bit of sympathy I have for people, BE gone!  For all those who have hurt my friends I have now, Be gone!  I'm not playing games anymore.  I'm not going to be walked on or controlled.  It's time I care of ME and my family and friends.  To everyone else reading this that has some pleasure to gain by reading my blog a year after we've been together to  try to come sort of conclusion, Be gone.    For my true honest to god friends: You guys are the best! I love you guys with all my heart and soul.  It's time for me to prove it.  I realized that this last three years I have put you all through a lot of crap and I am deeply sorry.  I hope you know I'll make it up to you.  I will always be here for you, even if I am playing a game and u call me 20 times about a chili recipe :).

      I'd love to really sit an blog... but i'm really stoned on some northern lights so i think i will just sit back and enjoy the buzz....   I went out to go see alliegirl for her birthday party.  Her boyfriend is super cool... Needs a hobby not associated with fish...  And that doesn't involve robbing a bank (inside joke)... But cool none the less.. Oddly enough I think they balance each other out.  Saw heather and her new fling.  All I have to say is   I can't think of anything to say except you dumbass you would have gotten away with robbing the damn bank!  Next time don't stop and count it you dumbass!!!  Did I mention he was a dumbass???  I enjoyed that trip much better being stoned!  I think if i was stoned my whole relationship with jeff i'd prllly still be with him ... thank god for small miracles!!!!!  Ok all gonna go watch the 1am trading spaces...

      Well lots has happened in 24 hours I got some kind of virus that did a dump memory error then restarted and totally fucked my windows up So i had to go to unfuckers house and repair windows.  Brian's machine is almost done.  He's good at puzzles.  David and I got into another money arguement.  I'm not letting him get the better of me.  I'm just not gonna to deal with stuff wiith him because all we do is fight.  That's just the end of it.  I care about our friendship more than i do about making or loosing money.  OK that was creepy... Allie just imed me and told me she was reading my blog as i was posting... that's just too wierd.  My  desk is TOTALLY clean and a new 17 inch monitor!!!! no more little monitor!!!!!  Business has been decent, incase anyones was wondering.  No more fronts this week I need Texas money!

      well this is gonna be a beautiful cycle I can tell... My mood swings are drastic and my mind is totally cluttered even while i'm stoned.  Brian went to freight fest with steven.  I just don't feel like being social.  I blew off his sister's, blew him and steve off, could have gone for drinks with glor, but i just felt blah.  I think it's the season change.  Lack of money for one whole year.  I can't believe I've had one job this year.  I can't believe me and brian have been together a year.  I can't believe what I was like 2 years ago.  I mean talk about night and day difference.  I guess I can say one thing.. I've learned enough in these last two years to not allow myself to continue to make those mistakes all over again.  I've learned that people have behavioral patterns that can be qued in to a life clock of someone elses.  Meaning that if you really know someone you know what thier behavior is like and if they don't check in with you with in a certain time frame you begin to worry.  If they act a certain way you know u won't hear from them for a while.  It's strange how one person's behavior changes the clock of someone else.  I think this is where most guys lack in relationships.  I mean I don't think a guy let's someone know them well enough or close enough that someone else notices thier behavior.  I know Gloria's behavior pretty well.  I know when she's gonna be 3 hours later than i'll be leaving in 10 minutes.  I know when she's gonna just plain old blow me off most of the time.  I know when I should see her online.  I don't know one man that knows me that well... They don't allow themselves to know me that well.  I mean Gloria's not the only one i know.  I know Doug's, Allie's, starting to figure out justin's, David's, Brian's, my brother... I just don't know if anyone besides glor KNOWS me.  and with how close I am to some of these people that scares me.  Do your biorhythms of one person effect the others around them?? Does 1 biological clock around someone elses without us realizing it?

      Sagittarius Romance Scope - Female Wed Dec. 24, 2003   You will have to do some real talking today, as the celestial influences kick in and creates the potential for a really dramatic turn of events. This is a great opportunity to really make some powerful changes in a current relationship, and to deepen the bond between you and a certain special person. It may not be easy, but it will certainly be rewarding.  Hummmmmmmmmmmm I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing... I guess the stars have it in for me today.  Todd's Male Scope  Taurus Romance Scope - Male Wed Dec. 24, 2003  You've probably been stressed out all week, and this is therefore just the day for you to relax, unwind, and spend some time alone with your significant other. You might decide to prepare a sumptuous dinner for the two of you. The day's aspect implies that this is the night to indulge yourself in good food, good wine, and great sex. Add some marvelous music, and you've got a wonderful evening. Enjoy!  I wasn't planning on seeing him but maybe i should!

      Well.. It;s been a strange ass weekend... I guess now that Brian is working nights I can actually write without him over my shoulder.. Not that he really reads this anyway (Obviously).  Friday, I don't think I did nuch of anything.  Saturday made up for it.  Gloria called me at 9am with a crying phone call about Steve taking her keys then leaving.  She was all worried like I wouldn't go get her.  Went up there took Britt and Brandon to Grandma's and took Steven To Ger's.  I think we came back ehre so I could change and went to Mom's to decorate the tree cause she was starting to stress about it.  Mike and Candy were supposed ot be there but showed up 10 minutes after we left.. Mind you they were supposed to be there at the same time.  So somehow Mike managed to sneak out of another tree decorating.. That's ok I'm NOT undoing the tree this year.  That house is magical at christmas.  I tell ya my mother is such the bestest mom in the whole world.  We walked in and smelled cinnamon.  She had baked fresh oatmeal and raisin cookies.  Can you say YUM?  Anyhow, we left there ran an errand for my mom went back to my house and Rob was here about 10 minutes later.  Those two went and did thier thing and I waited for Todd.. Went christmas shopping then over to adventure inn grabbed some za on the way...  Sat and chatted for a while.. Made complete use of the bathroom... We won't go there...   All I can say is my knees were shaking uncontrollably...  We ended up cuddled up on the other bed and after round 4 or 5 with Gloria and Robthey were passed out.. Me and him sat and talked for hours and hours... Prolly like 4-5 hours... It was so cool... I didn't want the night to end!  Why is it the one I really like has to be moving 4 hours away???  He was saying that WE have to move Bill out and THEN he's putting the house up for sale.. That's the plan.  So I might have him til April in an empty house... Man that's gonna be a terrible thing.... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT.   Sunday my mother calls me at 8:45 UUUUGGGGGGGG... Went to go see Aunt Diana in the hospital.  Ran in to Linda Hill on the way out.  She's got her mother living with her and her oldest son.  She's Got a cousin dying. Her best friend in the hospital.. Still manages to smile I'm not sure how.  So then a 2 hour drive to Genoa with no music to drown out the drama of my parents.  To a Christmas part at my Cousin's.. It was so cool to see the kids enjoying that house like we did when we were that age.. My Aunt Rose was being as obnoxious as ever and Carl was drinking way too much turnedd in to an asshole.  But over all it was nice to have that many kids around.  Came home to Gloria's boyfriend Steve slitting his wrists in front of the kids.  He was eventually brought into custody.  Somewhere along the line he disabled Gloria's car and her car is not running as far as I know.  Actually calling her right now to make sure I don't have to go get the kids tomorrow.    Today was a very prosperous day... Ever wake up just feeling like it's gonna be a good money day??? Thank God for potheads!  Saw Justin today :) was nice to see him!  Wierd I supply him now LOL... Anyway... I've played 3 tourneys today and placed in all of them so i'm finding my groove... better I need to make up for some lost money...  Love you guys!

      Sagittarius Romance Scope - Female Sun Dec. 21, 2003 The current planetary alignment may make you wish that you had perhaps never set eyes on a certain person. You feel that it is impossible to understand where they are coming from, what they want, nor want you are getting from the relationship. But if you could only change your perspective ever so slightly, you may see a very different picture emerging - and one that pleases you far more.

      Well I won in 2 different tourney's last night both paying $12 a piece.  I'm gonna spend today on Rich's quilt/laundry unless Gloria comes over.  Saturday me and Glor are partying!  Todd and I are going together to a night of fun... Just didn't want to bring Brian... Needed a more up beat person... I dunno... This whole Todd thing is a good thing I think.  Would I leave Brian for Todd??? Maybe if Todd wasn't moving up to the Dells.  Since I only have him for a few more months I just want to get as much time in with him as I can.  His brother called last night and I was at Annex with rich.  He was askin gme like a million questions...   Bill: What are you doing? Me:  I'm sitting down at dinner. Bill:  Isn't Brian at work? Me:  yesssssss Bill:  Who are you with?? Me:  Rich.......... Bill:   But brian's at work right??? Me:   YESSSSSSS Bill:   Do you guys have anything? Me:   Not til about 11:30 Bill:   Well I'll drop money off Me:   ok can I go now? Bill:   Ya I'll talk to you later  So I called Todd right away....  Me:     Todd??? Todd:  Yep Me:      your brother is an asshole! Todd:  Why what did he do now?? Me:      20 questioning me about where I am and what I'm doin'.... What are you doing?? Todd:   Out with Zack why? Me:      Well I think HE thinks you are out with me. Todd:   Let him think what he wants Me:      I just don't want to loose you over his bullshit Todd:  Don't worry about that     Me:     What are u doing Saturday? Todd:  Nothing really Me:     Keep it open.. We are gonna go out then Todd:  well I dunno Me:     Me Gloria bob hotel room... Todd:  I'll definately be there!     so that was my night last night.  I think Todd and I have to have the same talk Bob and Gloria are gonna have.  He's been overly nice ever since Bill started this shit.  I swear to god we are all gonna fuck with him now... Next time he calls me and he KNOWS Brian isn't around I'm gonna tell him I'm sucking dick leave me alone.  See how fast he calls Todd LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL... I'm so bad

      u learn something new everyday.  it's funny 2, as i was telling alan last night how jealous i was that Heather got an over-active thyroid.  anyway...  first i gain weight & have not really been eating alot & then my head gets really screwy & then i find this:  Thyroid Function People with bipolar disorder often have abnormal thyroid gland function.5 Because too much or too little thyroid hormone alone can lead to mood and energy changes, it is important that thyroid levels are carefully monitored by a physician.  People with rapid cycling tend to have co-occurring thyroid problems and may need to take thyroid pills in addition to their medications for bipolar disorder. Also, lithium treatment may cause low thyroid levels in some people, resulting in the need for thyroid supplementation.   one more thing 2 blame on the dragon.    damnit katy... i wanna play literati!!!!!!!!!!  ;oP

      my head is racing & i'm talking 2 myself.  i think i'm going nuts again.  i haven't felt this way in a loooonnnnggg time.  it's frightning.  i dunno why, as deep inside i knew it would eventually come back.  it always comes back.  i suppose if alan could accept the fact that there is something wrong with my head things would be a bit easier, but this by far has nothing 2 do with him.  maybe him telling me constantly that i'm not crazy has something 2 with the absolute shock that i'm in about feeling this way again.  these r the moments when the gift we r given 2 just end it all seems almost a blessing.  i suppose it's a bit like physical pain that goes away & then one day just comes back 2 promise u an undisclosed period of agony.  it's agony u've gone through so many damn times that u feel it's almost not worth it 2 go through the gut-wrenching pain again.  this is not 2 say i'm going 2 kill myself.  i'm not.  i'm just saying this particular damning occurence (that happens time & time again) makes the thought run rampant through my mind.  like walking in2 a building u know is gonna come crashing down any second now & knowing u will not escape it.  would u walk in?  how about getting in2 a car with a sadistic serial killer?  no, i don't think so.  but here i am, doing it because i'm supposed 2 endure this, right?  i mean, supposedly God is not supposed 2 let that which we cannot endure happen.  ok, great, now i start crying.  i feel sick at heart, my stomach is turned like there's rotting chicken sitting in it.    i'm really glad, though, Katy, that u seem 2 have handled things wonderfully yesterday.  {{{{{Katy}}}}}}

      Ok this is how my day's been.. I think I need a little help from above.  It's been one of those days were your whole world could actually flip over and you'd still be ok.  I am so done with Arlyn that I hate him.  He's such a ball of energy tho that he's addicting...  That's all he is an addiction..  He got that lightning bolt on his arm because he said that I used to call him the bolt.  I mean I did call him that but that he actually did a tattoo about it made me think MAYBE this time he figured it out.  He will never figure it out. So established relationship with Arlyn is no longer! Established my relationship with Craig and Carl.  It's been a good day IU thought the talk I was supposed to have was Arlyn.  It turned out to be Carl.  Oh ya and me and Todd are totally cool!  GOD, grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change Courage to change the things I can and the Wisdom to know the difference.  Living ONE DAY AT A TIME; Enjoying one moment at a time; Accepting hardship as the pathway to peace.  Taking, as He did, this sinful world as it is, not as I would have it.  Trusting that He will make all things right if I surrender to His Will;  That I may be reasonably happy in this life, and supremely happy with Him forever in the next.  Amen

      promised myself i'd do this 2day.  had wonderful insight on everything last night & of course now that i'm actually in front of the puter it all seems dull.  everything.  gimmie a few minutes while this THC makes it's way through my system & hopefully i'll be able 2 see in colors again.  Katy, i just realized that when i emailed u a few minutes ago i4got 2 include the link 2 the site i was talking about.  http://gogags.blogspot.com/ .   i got stoned & 4got.   & what kinda shit is this that u've pulled: saying u're gonna be in a poker tournament & not giving us u're results immediately.  SHeeSH.  how rude!!!  ;oP  i find it rather ironic that i should find that 'no more fish' message on the tagboard as Alan came home with 5 bettas on friday night.  Apparently het hought it was ok cuz they r 4 me, not him.  WHY DOES HE NOT UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  DOG  &  FISH ????  i said DOG..... DOOOOOOGGGG , not Fish....  DDDDDdddddOOOOOOooooGGGGggggggggggg !!!  if he buys me something that has anything 2 do with fish or aqariums, or even water 4 that matter i am pouring bleach in these tanks.  i swear 2 Heaven that i will do it! hmmnn.... or maybe i can just give him a bunch of Tori Amos & Sarah McLachlan cd's.  that might even get the picture across better.    my dad's gone 4 his stress test 2day.  i hate this.  i really really hate this. i also hate my head.    My head has performed an illegal operation & must shut down.  u will lose all unsaved information.

      LOL funny I'm going to have one of those talks with Arlyn and here's my horoscope...   The planetary alignment gives you plenty of scope for change and transformation within your relationships. You tend to have a somewhat experimental approach to your dealings with others, and may not be able to resist poking around to see what you can discover today. If you do intend to hold one of "those" conversations, then don't be too hardhearted. Others will respect you more.

      Well my weekend... Not a whole lot of anything.. Spent some good quality time with Michelle and Brian on Saturday night. We went to chineese buffet and no one got sick.  That's always a plus.  I saw Todd Friday.  He was a tad pissed.  Bill had blown something i said WAY out of proportion.  I had to talk my way out of him being mad.  That's the last thing I need is Todd pissed.  Maybe Bill is figuring it out?  That would suck!  Tonight i've been playing poker on GamingClubPoker.com.  I'm entered in a tournament that starts at midnight so i'll be around

Bruizer finishes up and is stalking toby for his food So  opened up the catnip and bruizer came right over.  So I had Toby eating the can and Bruizer eating catnip. Then Toby realized there was cat nip out like 2 minutes later so started stalking bruizer for the catnip.  So bruizer left the cat nip and went back over to Toby's tuna on the other side of the room.  Toby decided to stick with the cat nip.  I have a pothead kitty!!!!!!

      well, the laundry room is flooded again.  i have decided that it's the fault of the RO unit (a device that takes  EVERYTHING  out of water except the hydrogen & oxygen, even viruses & bacteria that Alan uses 2 make tank water 4 some of his rare babies  *ack*gagme*) & no one else's.  the thing is either haunted or possessed.  there is no way under the sun that the thing could have flooded various parts of our house as many times as it has in the unit's short time here with us.    there is something wrong with me & i can't write.  ;o/ Go watch TWIN PEAKS right now even if u have 2 travel 100 miles 2 find a copy of it.   don't ask me why.  just do it.

      Ok I just want EVERYONE to know I am TOTALLY dry even on personal so don't ask I'll have more tomorrow!  I finished the binding on Brian's quilt today and ran around with Mom.  All I have left to do is the hand sewing of the binding.  That's the  part that takes forever.  I think I will go get fabric for the "wings on the prarie" quilt I do for Rich.  Next is Laurel's baby's blanket andd MAYBE if I stay on track I can get Gloria's quilt started before June. Keep your fingers crossed I'm not promising anything.  The house is nice and peaceful without Brian here.  The 8am thing was a bit hard but I got up as soon as he left.  Look out world I might become a morning person yet.. Na probably not.  Maybe I can make Allie a quilt for her birthday if I am REALLY on track.  We'll see.  Oh ya new poem posted last night.. Not the best but  it works

Michelle that I speak of is NOT my ex Michelle.  This Michelle has a brain cell!  I really try to not talk about THE michelle anymore... This Michelle USED to be friends with Kat

"I told you no" I really have no idea what she's talking about when Doug decided to tell me that he wishes I was dead I put him on ignore and toook her off my list haven't talked to her since.  Oh well... I'm tired of child games.. Why is it that everyone think I want down thier pants when I am just trying to help??? WTF is wrong with people?  God it's so irritating.  I went to go start my Regal and the battery is dead.  SO i have to fork out ANOTHER $40 I don't have.  I am so sick and tired of living like this.  Something's gotta give!

      Ok hopefully tonight i will set up a new and improved tagboard on my page and Tony's.  I'm just very relived today Brian got a call back from Bill's.  Hopefully he starts on Tuesday.  We went and pick up aps today and fixed his resume.  Rachel's here been since school let out today.  Brian is rolling up J's so I don't have to.  Then WE are filling out aps.  Today we went and dropped off his resume to the places that he has all ready put in applications.  Picked up new ones for both of us.  Updated my rusume a little.  I actually got brian to brush his teeth.. That was a task.  We are gonna go over to Wal-mart and Walgreens tonight.  He needs a real job and so do i i know this.  I just don't want to have to work and i don't have to work if he brings in the rent money a month.  i got so stressed out over it i went off on my mom and candy about it yesterday.  Just broke down.  Can't handle it any more. I told brian that and i think he FINALLY understands why we are in the predictament we are in.  I can't handle the lying about jobs anymore.    Anyway on  a happier note.. Gloria is gonna go see Bob.  That will just toally rock! I am so happy she is doing something for herself for the first time in a long time.  4 years to be exact. LOL Anyway, love ya glor... EVERYTHING happens for a reason!

Anyway it's up for sale $2000 OBO  88 buick regal 2 door..  brand new fuel filter new brakes  cleaned EGR New ECM  New Ignition control module and coils New plugs and wires  no rust interior is in good shape no tares tires are decent about 25 to the gallon carpet is in good shape ceiling is intact  Cruize, tilt, heat and ac am fm cassette stock radio power windows power locks power seat fuel injected (auto start would rock for winter) automatic 2.8 engine  digital speedometer  This would be a great to and from work car!

      My morning started out by puking at 5am.. I was laying in bed and was afraid to cough knowing I would puke  what a horrible feeling... Followed by chrissy calling at 10am.  Well last night Brian and I started arguing over money and that I refuse to pull money out of my 401.  This fight all started because he made a HUGE production out of loosing $20.  I am TIRED of living like this!  This week is job hunting week for me and if I find a job before he does he's done!  I am mentally EXHAUSTED!  David and I are going out tonight.  I can't stand to be around Brian another night.  I will seriously flip a lid.  I am so stressed out that I can't even think straight anymore.  I need a night OUT!  I'm gonna finish smoking this bowl.. Call Ruben.  Eat some Mac and cheese.  Go to mom's work on brings quilt.  Go to this damn tree lighting ceremony.  Then go deal with eder and any business then go out.  I guess I should get used to doing all this running around myself.  I've been pretty spoiled as far as I don't have to do anything.  Anyways, hopefully I'll be able to get a pack of "cigarettes" rolled since I have only been asking him to do this for like ever.  That way we can keep track of how many we sell a little easier.  Ok I'm done babbling

      I just had the STUPIDest arguement with doug.  I've been telling shannon she could move up here.  I wasn't trying to get down her pants cause if i wanted that i could prlly just go down there and get it.. That's not even the case and I am so sick of her being afraid to talk to me due to him.  So when you children are done playing games let me know.  I've always been here for both of you.  So Doug said he hopes I die... That just landed him on my ignore list... have fun!

      Ok so I think that I finally got thru Brian's head how important him getting a job is to me, my well being, and health.  That I am NOT going to finacially support him by myself and he HAS to go get a job.  I mean am i really asking alot??  I gave in to him all summer long about not working but him and I made an arrangement about him spending more time with Steven during the summer.  So he held up to his end of the bargain and I held up to mine.  School has been in session for 3 months.  Now all the kids will be trying to get temp holiday jobs.  I'm about to break in to tears over this all over again.  I didn't put up with the with doug why should i put up with it with him?? I love him.. I really do.. It just hurts that i can't motivate him in a positive way.  It always has to end up with me nagging at him to get something done.. I'm really not knowing  what i want to do.

      So my pipes are either froze or clogged.  Since YESTERDAY!  So he gets off work and calls   Brian:do u need anything.   Me: I have no kitchen sink Brian: I'll bring some drano.  Mind you he was at his parents house ALL night so bumbass me ASSUMES he would bring a little space heater.  He stops at Jimmy's and comes home instead of giong to my parents house where there IS a space heater, or his parents that has a space heater.  He came home last night WITHOUT a space heater to drop off clothes and pick up his work shirt.  Comes home from work WITHOUT a space heater and a sink full of water.  Instead of manually draining out the sink, he pours a half a bottle of drano in the sink.  Hello ,water, sink, no air cirulation.  So before he leaves instead of getting the access water out of the sink he pours the OTHER half of the bootle in.  I discovered this AFTER i spent na hour getting water out of the sink.  So I call him.  Me: Do you think maybe it wasn't working the first time u put the drano in? Bri: well it started to go down some. Me: no dumbass it didn't Bri: well it looked like it to me Me: why did you pour in the other half in a frozen fucking sink Bri: I'll fix it tomorrow Me: Brian I have no kitchen sink.  I would have had a kitchen sink last night If you would have brought me over a space heater.  Bri:  It's froze on the outside Me: it's frozen on teh inside too  And then people wonder why I am post poning the wedding.  I am so irritated!

      Well I finally got to talk to Zack.  Zack is Todd's best friend (another virgo).  Zack told me somethings that I am not sure are true or not.  The thoughts are nice though.  I'm not sure if he's telling me what he wants me to hear or not.  Something isn't adding up.  So I called Todd,  Todd: Hello Me: Hey Todd: Hey Me: whatcha up to Todd: getting ready to have some fun (enter girl's voice in the background) Me: well sorry for interrupting Todd: Ya I'm gonna let you go Me: Whatever (Click)  Dave was here he's like who the fuck was that? Todd.  What the ehll was that all about? I dunno he had some chick there so I hung up.  About an hour later Todd's cell calls the house.  So of course I answer "What?" It's Zack.  So we started talking about the fact that he's been an asshole since the night at the hotel with Gloria and Rob.  Zack admitted that was his doing.  He didn't want his best friend getting hurt.  He didn't know me from adam or eve.  After talking to Zack he promises to make it right again.  That boy was REALLY lucky I was too stoned to go anywhere.  I really miss Todd a lot.  I can't get that nigh tout of my head without something to replace it.  I don't really want to be WITH Todd.  Just so he's not giving em the silent treatment anymore would be nice.  That's what I told Zack.  So we shall see what happens.

      Sagittarius Romance Scope - Female Fri Jan. 30, 2004 	by Astrocenter.com  The planetary constellation may create a few waves in your close relationships, but don't let this bother you, as it is an entirely positive process. A minor issue may have been creating some stress or tension recently, but you finally manage to trace the cause back to its source and so bring about a speedy resolution. Just a little more give and take, and all will be well!

      Sagittarius Horoscope Thu Jan. 29, 2004  Don't turn down any invitations for today! A group meeting or social event could be thrown together with some casual acquaintances, dear Sagittarius, and the status of your relationships with those people could abruptly change. At the very least, some will become friends, but you might also acquire some valuable business contacts or even partners. You might even fall in love. At day's end, you could be walking around in a daze, as you never expected this to happen.  Oh ya i need a day like today like I need a hole in the head.  Where the hell is Carl?  He had better be in class or something.  I am not even playing.  No phone calls and no return emails is getting really old really fast.  If you're scared don't think for one second I am not.  I realized yesterday all I need in my life is FRIEDNS with benefits.  Don't get me wrong I am still with Brian but with a whole new attitude in the relationship.  If he doesn't want to loose me he knows he can not just settle.  I need a benefit for being with him.  Right now is fine but when I move out of here Everything will be different.  IF there no more benefits to be with him I won't be.  That's with all my friends.  Gloria the benefit of having you in mylife (besides the normal stuff I've been saying for 15 years) is that if I can't have kids of my own I can help you raise yours.  That is a huge huge huge thing to me right now.  David we've all ready discussed what needs to be done.  I'm not really playing this time.  The only one that is taking em seriously and is not trying to stop me from doing what I am doing is Gloria.  That means more to me than you could ever know.  If you are not a benefit to me I will no longer allow you to come and go out of my life whenever you feel necessary.  That's the bottom line.  You are either in my life or you are not.  I am tying up loose end relationships.  I have a few people i do not want to exclude out of that.  Gloria, David, Brian, Michelle, maybe Tony if he can not be such a jerk, Allison and Carl.  I would be very happy just making these people family.  We all have our own families, and that's a beautiful thing.  I don't want this group of friends to disappear.  I am going to do what it takes so we are working as a team, as a bond that can't be broken, whatever level that might be.  I erally do love you guys and I'm so done with everything I really have no emotion over moving.  If somethign doesn't change realy soon I'm gone.  I'm not even kidding around.  I wrote carl an email about what I'm doing to make all this happen.  If anyone wants a copy let me know.  or the first time I am REALLY REALLY REALLY just done.  I'm not mad, hurt, angry, or depressed.  This is what done is.  There is no emotion.  I'm just done.

      something very strange is going on.    anyway, Katy, u're brother is the shit!!!!  got this little story out of some stupid cigerette flyer doral sent me (& NO, i don't smoke those nasty things):  "Let's face it, men & women hope for different things on valentine's day, & getting the wrong thing can be dissaponting.  Just ask Doral & Co. member Maggie Rubin of Florida who once got an electric welder from her husband.  Next valentine's day she responded by giving him a pair of diamond earrings.  good for you margaret!"  k...i just thought that was one of the most amusing things i've read lately & wanted 2 share.  Gloria, did u get sicker with Stephen & Brandon than u did with Britt?  God, i really don't hope this child is a boy.  that's horrible 2 say, i know, but it also makes complete sense that boys would make u vomit more than girls.  shit, even when they r 40 men can make u a hellova lot more nauseous than women.

      Sagittarius Romance Scope - Female  Wed Jan. 28, 2004 	by Astrocenter.com If you have had someone special in mind, then be prepared to get that much closer now, thanks to the astral energy in the air. If you are attending any kind of party or social gathering, be prepared for the temperature between you to rise dramatically. You will both feel able to share your emotions in a positive and possibly passionate way. After this you may even become a permanent item.

      This is so I don't have everyone and thier mother yelling at me about this.  I'm telling everyone at the same time.  Minus David because if it wasn't for him talking some real sense in to my situation I wouldn' be making this statement.  Due to the fact that grandma has passed away, we are post poning wedding plans until we are really ready.  No more questions about wedding plans.  Sorry guys it's just not worth my stress right now.  If I am going to do the next thirty years right this is the first step.  We are still engaged but just without a date set.  Brian was REALLY REALLY ok with that.  If my predictions are right Bill will convince him to move up there.    I will be free to do whatever I please.  If things change and we get grandma's house then we will see.  Now I know the reason that i am not getting the house.  Jen is mad that I convinced crissy to take steven off meds.  She thinks that he should be on them.  Jen is Bill's (brian's mom's brother) daughter.  So it's Brian's cousin.  Anyway Bill has beenthe whole hold up on us moving in and now I know why.  So in order to fix that situation I have to sit down with her and takl to her so she will convince her dad to let  us move in.  OR i say whatthefuckever not care and move on.  Right now I don't know what i want and it scares me.  After some really long talks with David I'm really ok with how things are going.  I need more Carl's in my life.  I need more David's in my life.  I need more Gloria's and Allie's in my life.  I need people that genuinely care about me and my well being.. All you others that haven't gotten that can kiss my ass.   Incase anyone missed it David is posting on the blog now. And I wrote 2 new poems and posted new lyrics yesterday.  Carl I really hope to god I see you tomorrow.  I promise things are gonna be different.  Ok see if you can see where I am going with this.  Wendy asks me if I will be her 5th on leagues.  After I picked my jaw off the floor, I asked her who was on her team.  Her, this guys Juan, big don, and Brian. If you really care who brian is you should really call me and find out.  I can't say on here but for real call me.  So I'm playing on Wednesday nights for Joyce on Wendy's team.  Mind you Wendy and Arlyn are a "thing".  So Big Don and I are gonna have SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much fun! I can't wait!  We are going to be at least 3rd.  Probably better than that.  Anyone that thinks they might be interested in coming out should really call me first to make sure my shadow is going to be home and not with me.  Love you guys.  I'm sleeping in til Carl calls.  I'll call ya when I get up Glor.

      Well we buried Brian's grandma today.  Just when I thought I was done burying grandparents.  Travis goes over by Laurie and says where's grandma, as we are at the cemetary.  He said that Laurie started crying.  Kevin almost started i'm like come on don't do this to me Kev.. I'm trying to keep Larry sr, jr, Brian, mom and myself together.. Don't you start.  Service was nice and short the burial was even faster due to the bitter cold.  So now it's time to unwind, unstress, and wait to hear if we can move in to grandma's house.  All the same time, I just had a 4 hour conversation with david last night about post poning the wedding. His mom just asked me if I wanted grandma's wedding ring.  Now I'm thinking about my grandma's jewelery AGAIN.  I really need to push the wedding back some.  I know everyone that is close to me will understand.  Those that will get mad about it.  That's just too darn bad.  I want to make sure we are doing this because we are ready.  Not just because everyone expects us to be.  Carl did call today while I was at the funeral.  Was a huge help.  I just don't think he realizes how much that little stuff means to me.  It's all about little stuff, but then we are told not to sweat the little stuff.  So I'm not gonna sweat me and carl.  I really want him a part of my life and if I'm in his ace all the time I'm gonna push him away.. That's the last thing I need right now.

      Welcome aboard david.  You know now I really realized why we are friends in the first place.  Sometimes I know you really get it.  It's been a long time since I've had a guy I can confide in about everything.  That's what a true friend does.  Listens when he needs ot and loves you anyway.  Welcome to my next thirty years.  Posted these lyrics on my lyrics page too   My Next Thirty Years - Tim McGraw   I think I'll take a moment, celebrate my age  The ending of an era and the turning of a page  Now it's time to focus in on where I go from here  Lord have mercy on my next thirty years   Hey my next thirty years I'm gonna have some fun  Try to forget about all the crazy things I've done  Maybe now I've conquered all my adolescent fears And I'll do it better in my next thirty years   My next thirty years I'm gonna settle all the scores  Cry a little less, laugh a little more  Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear  Figure out just what I'm doing here  In my next thirty years   Oh my next thirty years, I'm gonna watch my weight  Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late  Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers  Maybe I'll remember my next thirty years   My next thirty years will be the best years of my life  Raise a little family and hang out with my wife  Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear  Make up for lost time here, In my next thirty years   In my next thirty years

      Copied this to Gloria this morning which was BEFORE she told me she was going to stop by just for the record!  Sagittarius Female Daily Monday Jan. 26, 2004  A female friend whom you haven't seen for a while could surprise you with a phone call or short visit. A lot of interesting news and useful information could be exchanged, benefiting both of you. You may make a number of short journeys throughout the day, Sagittarius, as you have a lot that needs to be done. A small increase in income could also be in the works. In the evening: Rent a romantic video.  Gloria stopped by after she did her taxes!  You go girl.. Go take are of all your fines.. Hopefully I can take care of the rest.. This has been a good money day so far and I think Matt is still stopping by..  Tonight was the first dinner with Steven at my house.  Was very strange.  Trying not to cry.. Got too many strange emotions going on at once.  Maybe I need a wrestling night good thing it's Monday!

      Incase things are getting too confusing in my life for some of you,  I'm not WITH WITH Allison.  I am pretty sure it was  just a one night stand thing.  It's all good whatever.  She knows how i feel and I'm not playing games.  Carl just earned such HUGE ass brownie points.  I'm not sure if he came up here cause he was out or because of the email I sent him.  Whatever the reasoning is I loved it.  I feel like I can go through the rest of my day after he shows up.  I know a virgo would never just show up because someone needed them.  They will always show up when they need you.  That's just as good to me, for now.  As long as i see you that's all I can ask for.    I am not speaking to Rich anymore.  He has decided to close me out of his life because I have been doing something for a year.  He's been closing me out of his life for 14.  Every time he has a girlfriend I don't mean shit to him I never even have the common curtesy of meeting her.  Why is that?  Is it because I will sare them away, or because you compare every other woman to me, or afraid i won't like her?  Well whatever the issue is I'm tired of having my life open for you with every relationship i have and you not even giving me the respect of meeting yours.  The pretend girlfriend has stopped pretending.  I will always care for you and love you and you will always have a special place in my heart.  Rich you have no place in my life anymore.  Gee and I told this to Eric.  Humm funny how shit comes full circle isn't it? At least Eric is happy for me.  Never in a hundred million years did i think I would be planning a wedding without my best friend.  When you are ready to talk and apologize for being a complete DICK, maybe we will talk again.  But i'm telling you what, I will not tolerate anymore bullshit out of you. So when you are ready to be a man for once and apologize for turning your back on me when I need you most then maybe we will talk.  otherwise you can kiss my ass.. You better think long and hard about that.  I hope you are really ready to be alone.  You wonder why you haven't settled down yet.  You are too narrow minded.  Too black and white.  You think you know EVERYTHING.  It's your way or the highway.  Life is full of compromises Rich and God knows i've made a lot of compromises for you and you end up blowin me off and not even giving me the curtesy of meeting your girlfriends.  You ahe a lot of emotional baggage u need to get rid of before any woman in thier right mind would be with you.  I don't understand why somethin gcompletely outside of our relationship has to end our relationship.  You have girlfriends completely outside of my relationship with you and I don't hold it against you.  You are going to play that card then so am I .. it hurts doesn't it?   Maybe you have some concept of how much you hurt me over the years.  you've dealt with this for a year I have dealt with you for 14.  Think abotu that before you tell me to not call you.  Before you decide to throw away 14 years of me putting up with your bullshit.  This is completely up to you!  I can forgive can you?

      Well after talking things over with Allie I realized that I am not holding up to ANYONE'S expectations but my own and sometimes my brother's.  I can not believe that Rich (of all people in the world) would just hate me for for doing something that I am good at and enjoy.  Sure it might be illegal but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be legalized.  There are more accidents related to drinking which is legal then smoking marijuana which is illegal.  humm magine that.  The medical world knows what smoking can help.  It's helped my insomnia, my cronic lower back pain, and my ability to focus on a project.  That's the god's honest truth.  Even you have said it's helped your asthema.  So why are you so mad at me exactly?  Cause i'm not out doing a 9-5 job?  Ever once just once think that maybe I am very happy doing what i am doing?  Thought that even you could be happy for me for a change and just accept things.  When you are ready to apologize you let me know.  Allie you're the bestest!

       urlLink     wow.  that's kinda messed up, but i guess i can see the point if he's just worried u're gonna get caught doing it.  other than that - IT'S MARIJUANA 4 FUCKING CHRIST'S SAKE!!!  perhaps u should point out that in some places (like where i am) people can drive a half hour & smoke the shit LEGALLY (as it was meant 2 be).  it's not like u're selling things that can kill anyone.  *sigh*  {{{{{{{Katy}}}}}}}}  alan says he's gonna get us some white widow seeds from some other continent so we can grow when we move.  urlLink      all them things u said about virgos...  it's funny.  he IS very jealous without telling me so & has an insane sense of humour that i'm not quite 100% sure he uses 2 exactly throw himself in2 the center of attention, but he does use it 2 try & get & keep my attention.  which is cool, but not when i'm reading ;oP.  other than that he tells me he Loves me all the time, but it took a whole hellova lot 2 get 2 i'm sorry.  like, me saying, 'ok then, i'm leaving',  & then getting 90% of my shit out of the house.  just sat there & looked at me like his whole world was crashing down.    other than all that, i can understand u're need 2 feel secure in the world, or in the little world u & brian have made with each other, but i think more importantly u should feel emotionally & spiritually satisfied in the relationship.  it's silly of me 2 think that u'd overlook that, i just want 2 see u that way more than anything & had 2 point in out just in case u're so frustrated with not being financially ok those things took a backseat.  basically, i think u can get through tough times with money & keep u're Love & relationship strong as long as u're emotionally & spiritually sound with each other.  then again, i don't have 2 worry about that kind of thing, so it's kinda pretentious 4 me 2 say.  u know i don't mean 2 offend u.  i just don't wanna see u say, 'ok, he's supporting us now, he can have me' & then realize a month later u feel empty with him.  i Love u, Katy, even if i DIDN'T call u last night.  i'm willing 2 bet $1000 that once i get on some damn lithium i'll be much more social.  & then after the baby is born, when i get on the rest of the stuff i need, i might actually be pleasent 2 hang out with & talk 2.  i don't wanna subject anyone 2 this horrid depression plagued with the occasion wild, intense UP & DOWN i've been experiencing, so i've been staying away from everyone.  i don't think it's fair that anyone have 2 deal with it.  funny, though, somehow i feel it's fair that i have 2.      urlLink     urlLink

      Sagittarius Romance Scope - Female Fri Jan. 23, 2004  You will feel more inclined to let someone special know how you feel about them today. If you feel confident enough to do this personally, then create a special atmosphere and invite them over. Otherwise try writing a beautiful heartfelt letter, or even some poetry to set their hearts on fire, and make them want to discover more of your hidden secrets.  I new something was in the stars today... check out the next post.. that was BEFORE this one.. Strange!

      Well I'm gonna mark today down as my soul searching day.  Last night Brian got home about 10:15pm.. keep that in mind  After a sever pow wow with Gloria, Allison, Sherry and Jerimiah regarding moving to Tennessee, I did a deeeeeeeeeeeep meditation.  I don't ask for spirit guide help very often.  So in desperate measures I asked only 1 favor.  For 3 phone calls with these questions asked: Who Loves me? Who do I love? Who should I be with.  I started this deep meditation about 8:30.  9:30pm David calls.  10:00pm Brian got home (as good as a phone call).  Carl calls at about 11:30am.  Funny how that seems to work out isn't it?  I know no matter how much of a bitch I am to David or how much of a dick he can be to me.  I know he will always love me (in a totally plutonic way). I do love Brian with all my heart.  and there was a whole 12 hours in between calls.  Carl called after I wasn't planning on hearing from him all weekend.  I now know what I need to do in order to get the answers I really want.  I just have to ask for simple answers and simples ways.  I feel very centered.  As loony as all this sounds, I have a piece of mind that what I have felt were the right answers to those questions were the right answers.  Brian's grandma passed away.  We think the services are Monday.  He's doing ok.  Better than me actually.    Gloria and I had a heart to heart again today.  Those are the kind of conversations that make me realize how much I really do care about you.  Please don't ever feel like you can't talk to me.  I'm here for you no matter what. Let's take care of the drama!  June honey I promise everything will be easier.    I'm feeling very poetic today so I'm sure there will be some poems up later.  Carl is stoping by so we will see what he thought of gloria drilling the hell out of him with a million and one questions yesterday.  See why he's been up here every day for the last week and why he insists on telling me he is not looking for a girlfriend everytime he sees me, like he feels the need to dig it in deeper.  At least he's starting to feel more comfortable here.  That's a change of pace.  He's calling me just about every day.  Coming up here every chance he gets.  Yet he's not looking for a girlfriend.  I really don't get it.  It's supposed to be day time friends night time lovers not day time lovers and night time friends.  I really don't want him as a boyfriend right now, I'm not looking for that.  I have one of those that i can still get rid of if I feel the need to.  I'm not sure what i want.  I know that it can't get a whole lot worse then where it is right now.  I know there is better out there.  So realize a few things.  If I didn't have to worry about my bills at the house and still be able to do what i do.  Let you be able to do what you do.  There wouldn' be anyone else in my bed ever.  That's all I'm looking for right now is to be taken care of.  Not great, not even well of, just ok is good for now.  Need all the bills caught up and paid.  I can stay current.  Need to know you are going to be there when I need you, just like I am there for you.  You can have my heart.  I'm not asking alot.  Not even for a committment.  Just so I know everything will be ok is all i'm asking without changing my lifestyle.  Things can change and will change if I know just that much.  Nothing needs to change between you and me I don't want it to really, just a little bit acknowledgement that this is more than a fuck every once in a while would be nice.    I know virgos don't tell you anything and expect you to just know it all ready.  Certain things like saying i'm sorry, or i love you, or I really want to spend more time with you, please just accept me for who I am and everything will be fine, no virgo can ever say.  They are very stubborn and have more walls than a county jail.    They are very jealous people without ever telling you they are jealous.  They normally have a great sense of humor and have to be the center of attention.. Let me know how close I am.  Think I've dated a few?    I'm a sagittarrius.  Very forgiving.  Very understanding, creative, open minded, and funloving.   I'm telling you how to change things.. If you want them to change..  Getting the middle man out of the picture is not as hard as you think.  You just gotta step up to the plate.  I'm not asking for a whole lot.  Now it's up to you!  Time is ticking and neither one of us are getting any younger.  You do what you gotta do.  You know where I stand it's really that simple.  I'm not changing you or trying to change you.  You're a virgo  I wouldn't want to change you anyway I like you just the way you are.

      Ok I know this is going to sound like an Allie rant, but I'm going crazy again.  Carl was being such a jerk.   I tell him that "I'm gonna stay until I find someone better".. "Until you find someone better huh?"  "Ya until someone better says leave him, I'm stayin put."  No response.. I wanna kill him somedays.  Brian is an emotional wreck.  I've been so horny there is nothing that is working.  I gotta get this female out of my head before I got out to iowa.  I really don't wanna do that.  If that's what it takes.  I can't handle this anymore.  If you guys all thought I was a whore when I lived at Star's you ain't seen nothing yet.. It's like I've gone in to heat or something.  It's totally uncontrolable.  Even when I do get it it's VERY good but i'm still just ok.  I mean I know it's awesome.  I'm never knocking Brian for being bad in bed.  I would be lying.  It;s not him at all.  My sex drive is through the roof right now.  This moon cycle is very rough on me i'm goin to be happy to see it go.  Matt has made me realize that I have not had a woman since Cher was out back in July.  Now I'm really craving her.. This is SOOOOO not a good thing!  What the hell is wrong with me?  I think about it 24-7.  I'm starting to day dream about it in the car.  I mean it's not like I'm afraid to be with another woman or anything.  She's not even all that great in bed.. I meean she's good but not AWESOME.  I think that's my problem the only awesome one I've had that's curbed my appetite is Allison and for what ever reason she's not interested anymore.  I think Jim has brainwashed her to not having energy about anything.  I want my best friends back.  I think Me allison and Gloria should all just get an apartment together.. Me and allison share a bedroom.  That's it.  I miss my best friends.  I know life goes on but why are we all stuck in these dead end relationships and all of us are just DONE.  I mean really done.  If I could take my two best friends with me and move us all in the same place together i think I would be in heaven.  I would finally really be at peace.  Allison would be happy without jim.  Gloria would be happy without Steve.  I'd be happy as long as I could be with allison or gloria and not be with brian.. Before you flip Glor that might not have sounded right.  I really don't feel like over explaining myself but since I just opened up a can I might as well whoop ass on it huh?  In Katy's perfect world Gloria would make steve take fucking responsibility for once in his whole pathetic life and just leave Allison would really realize that she's just ok but not happy by far and CONSTANTLY broke ecause of bad decision HE's made. I would realize that I really am just settling. We'd all move out move in together in to a big 2 bedroom. Be each other's support. Start over.. Do the next 30 years right. Find me a woman that I can be happy with (but that's too much to ask) A booty call that doesn't treat me like a piece of shit (but that's too much to ask) then again this is my perfect world

      I have spent my whole damn morning on phones I need to get laid!!!!!   You might spend hours on the phone today, dear Sagittarius, possibly discussing opportunities to perform services for others. Your mental and physical energy should be high, and you'll want to use as many tools as you can to get whatever information you need, including books and the Internet. At some point you're going to want to get out and walk or work out, as you'll need to work off excess energy. A very stimulating and exciting day.

      Allie smoke a fucking bowl. Your body is going through THC withdrawals!  Thanks Gloria..  Now If I could just get everyone to pay me what they owe me I'd be all set.. $225 out as of right now and everyone wonders why I am dry.  Gee HUMMM let me think about that.  All I know is I better not have to sweat rent this month.  All the fronts will cease to exist. I'm not even playing.  I can not hold money, unless prior arrangements have been made between now and the end of the month.. C.O.D.  This is it I've had it! I've been a productive pothead today.  Mom cleaned the kitchen (4 hours) Picked up the foyer and put different fabric on the table Cat litter Got rid of that plastic bag in the foyer! fed the birds started on the bathroom Make a connection with Tommy Started to make call backs Cleaned off the bookcase  Still to do Finish up the bathroom Clean off Brian's desk Clean off my desk Clean off TV area Clean up the left side of the living room Start on putting away laundry from LAST week Go to Tommy's Take care of business Get really stoned Go to bed

      {{{{{{{Katy}}}}}}}  i almost 4got about quizzes.  seems like i almost 4got aout a lot of things.  finding myself again.  & really that has nothing 2 do with Alan.  i lose myself all the time.  well, not ALL the time.  but it seems 2 happen when i stop writing.  not the poetry, but when i stop journaling & even that has been damn near impossible - believe me i've tried - lately.  that sounds kinda rediculous, huh?  but really, it feels like i don't know who the fuck i am unless i write (or type) it all out.  perhaps therapy has conditioned me 2 be this way?!?!?  anyway, i'm not gonna go on & on.  2day is a good day so i'm not gonna ruin it.  i'll just say i think it's my delusions that r making things doubly hard.  maybe my head is more screwed up than even i know.   okee... going on a quiz spree now ;oP      You are a muse.    urlLink What legend are you? . Take the Legendary Being Quiz by  urlLink Paradox         Congratulations, you're Seattle, the Emerald City.

      Well I just had a HUGE business talk with allison it was like a 3 hour pow wow on weed selling 101.  I have to have the same talk with Ryan so we can get this shit off the floor.  I want a pent house not a basement apartment.  If that makes sense to anyone.  Anyway the deal is $10 a g $15 a g delivered.  I son't sell it any other way.. Break at the o... Took me 3 hours to explain it to allison that my week ends on Tuesday night.  I do all my books have to have my numbers in to the boss by 10pm Wednesday night  As long as you guys all understand that i can not get better stuff for cheaper money if i'm not being charged $150 on the front.  Sometimes I am only short $60 to not be charged $150.. Now that I have regular prices I can give you regular prices (previously stated).  If you want me to deliver it ok, but I'm not going to be out any money.  Come get it yourself.  I can make just as much money without having to go anywhere.  If you want an o or more this price does not apply.  I think that was the kist of the conversation.  After a few for instances and bowls later Allison finally understood.  I think I can explain it more to ryan so he can explain it to gary and brice.. Make this whole thing flow really well.  Now about my teeth.. Those are done for now.. Gotta get these gums down.  Maybe see a paradontist.  Not til after the wedding.. Just gonna do that the doc says (for once).  My gums will look alot better for the wedding and that's what's important.. After the wedding I can go on Brian's health insurance..  Then the real work starts..    Speaking of wedding plans I got to pick out a lot of music.. Just gonna start with what I had and do it all over.. With this whole new outlook on how crappy my family is there will be new plans coming.. Gotta jam for now.

      Went over to mom's for a few hours so she can fix bri's quilt.  Came home ran to walgreen's to get my perscriptions filled.  Grabbed some subway. Went home scarfed some food.  Went and picked up Rachel from work.  Came home.. Layed in bed.. Carl calls like 11:15!  Was something I really needed.  I dunno his voice is soothing to my soul.  I guess because I know he's super busy man and still finds time to call me.  I know when he's bored he calls, so that must mean somewhere, subconciously, he remotely thinks of me.  I guess that's a good thing. Talked to Todd.  I asked him if he was mad at me.  He said no just been busy.  Told him I felt like he has ben given me the cold shoulder for like 2 weeks. I'm sure that whole carl thing didnt' help.  He's like no just been busy.  So I was like whatever.  He's just too chicken shit.   He doesn't get it that i REALLY don't care what Bill thinks or says.  He's not an issue.  Todd's the one that has to live with him for a few weeks not me.  So whatever.. Anyway I'm going to the dentist for a 10:15 appt.  David is picking me up gonna program his satelite card and go to bed.  That's the game plan anyhow.

      Katy - u have no reason 2 have low self esteem... u r a WONDERFUL PERSON!!!  i Love u!!!  i feel bad posting my probelems on u're blog, but i have no where else 2 put them & i trust u & i just don't feel like talking so imma write this all so u'll get it.   i dunno if i can do this.  any of this.  i am scared.  scared 4 my physical & mental health.  i know u're answer is gonna be 2 leave him, but i don't wanna do that & he doesnt want it 2 end either.  besides, if this ends all my faith in Love will be gone 4ever.  maybe that's why i was alone 4 so long?!  i dunno.  i feel like my problems don't matter.  he keeps talking about he respects my stuff.  i don't give a shit if anyone respects my stuff or not, i'd just like some respect 4 my feelings, u know?  & now there's another kid.  not mine, but another one.  which is fine, ok, it was b4 us, two years b4 us & i guess it's not definite.  i don't even know what i'm so fucking upset about.  i just know i'm shaking like Goddamn leaf & my heart is thumping & all i want is a fucking joint.  i wish i could marry Mary jane.  SHE never lets me down, never breaks my heart, never makes me cry.  i just feel so alone, so unwanted.  so confused 7 scared.  i'm going 2 my dad's 2night.  i'm gonna call rich.  i need a male opinion on this all & i trust his.  God, i trust his more than i've ever trusted anyone's opinion, no offense.  it's just u've been hurt oodles of times b4 & u're prolly right, it's better 2 just run off than risk being hurt again.  he's so fucking detatched from everything it's easy 2 take what he says 2 heart, i guess.  not that that makes any sense at all, or does it?  fuck.  i don't know what makes sense anymore.  i feel like i should go 2 the hospital.. i am not safe.  i am scared.  i am losing my mind.  & God, i hurt so fucking bad.  why does all this bullshit start after i get pregnat?  when my emoptions r fragile 2 begin with.  & he says HE"S stressed?!?!?  i'd like 2 see him try this all from my side.  i can see resonalby why he's stressed out - working 15-17 hours a day 7 days a week & then coming home 2 all these fish & having 2 keep them alive.  but Katy, i have a serious mental problem & it's really detrimental 2 my mental health 2 hear over & over that there is nothing wrong with me when it took me YEARS 2 accept the fact that there is.  no one is in my head but me.  NO ONE.  NO ONE CAN POSSIBLY KNOW OR UNDERSTAND EXCEPT ME!  & on top of this all he's making an uneducated assumption about it all.  i have asked him time & time again - put the fucking information right in front of his face about this diesease & yet he's never read it.  i cannot give an accurate, unbiased account of it all especially when my head is so damn jumbled 2begin wityh.  i should have never done this.  i should have stayed in my fucking room 7 never left it.  i should not subject myself 2 people.  i only bring ruin & destruction.  i am so scared.  so completely terrified of everythin g.  & how can he say he cares about me & the baby when all i've been getting lately is worry & stress from him?  doesn't he know that this kind of thing can cause a miscarriage?  i'm beginnign 2 think that's what he wants, though he says over & over that he all he wants is 2 be with me, get amrried & have a family.  but i really dont know if he can handle tis.  i dunno if i can.  i have 2 pee.  God, even that makes me cry.  do u know how terrified i am everytime i go 2 the bathroom that i'm going 2 be bleeding profusely? this is not good.  not good at all.  fuck i think he's home i Love u. {{{{{{{{{{{katy}}}}}}}}}}}}

      Tomorrow is a money day!!!!!!!!!!  Successes with your work continue to bring good fortune your way, and today you might find reassurance that this is not a flash in the pan - you're likely to be financially secure for a long time. Health-wise, you're probably feeling strong and robust, full of energy and stamina, and ready to take on just about any challenge you can find. Move on ahead, dear Sagittarius, but move with caution. You're never too prosperous to be careful.  I have to go to the dentist and I am totally fearing it.  I mean like I am so scared I don't even want to go.  It;s a new dentist in a new office with new people.  The only comfort I have is Candy will be there so I know I am not just another number.  This is EXTREMELY hard for me to do.  The only reason why I have to do it now is because if my mouth looks better then I will be more inclined to loose weight.  I need to start feeling better about myself so I can go get a job.  Right now I have 0 self esteem.  0 reason to want to plan a wedding because I don't feel like I am marriage material right now.  Kind of in a blah about myself. Anyway, me and my mom are friends again.  I have this nasty headacvhe i can't seem to get rid of.  I can't sleep.  So I'm up playing cards.  Insomnia sucks!   My wellness scope which pretty much sums up what i just said... this week's been too flipping bizarre  Sagittarius Wellness Scope Sun Jan. 11, 2004  Ask yourself what you need to feel really comfortable in your body. Do you need to be in better physical condition? Do you need to feel stronger, have more flexibility, feel lighter or heavier? The way we live inside our bodies has everything to do with how we treat others and how we let others treat us. Unless we exist in a physical reality to our liking, it is difficult to create the emotional reality that we desire.

      Oh yay I am so thrilled...    Sagittarius Romance Scope Female Sat Jan. 10, 2004  The day's significant planetary aspect makes you certain of one thing, and that is that you are not sure what is going on between you and your sweetest love. No matter what angle you view the situation from, it just does not seem to make any sense. Perhaps instead of wracking your brains, you would be better to cease speculating, and allow the situation to unfold of its own accord.  Hey Glor.. Call me if you get around to it I know u are at work, just whenever.  So I must blog about the most bizarre day.. I wake up to an Email from Michigan Jeff asking how wedding plans were.. My response was as if you care... Last time I talked to you you were a total jerk.  How are you an nympha? Still together??    The other Jeff  Foxtrot: OMG hi Me: hi Me: ??? Jeff: I dunno just wanted to say hi *ignore *Send   This is how my morning started, followed by...   Me: Hello Carl: I'll stop by and see ya later Me: ok call me when you get close  Michelle stops over and we talk to eric.  There IS a Katy journal.  So I don't think I am giving this journal back until I get mine.  Carl shows up about 3:00.. Steve (Gloria's Bitch) shows up about 4:15.. Leaves  4:20 Todd calls.. Hey we are on our way.. Ok where are you.. Not quite to 41 yet 4:45 Bill and TODD show up  Me: Bill, Carl, Carl, Bill Bill: What's up??   Me: nothing sitting here chillin' Bill: think Brian can help me move? Me: Probably Me: HI!   Todd: Um hellloooo??? Me: Carl, Todd, Todd, Carl   Todd: Nice to meet you Carl: ya Bill: When's Brian's getting off work? Me: 8:30 Todd: Nice meeting ya.. I'll see ya later?? Me: Ya maybe Bill: Have Brian call me  They leave Carl: He's not competition Me:pffffffffft  Ok so carl leaves about 5:45.  I call Tommy.. I have some KICK SERIOUS ASS WEED!   HAIL TO TOMMY!!!!!!!!!!  As I'm hanging up with Tommy, the phone beeps.. Because I don't have call waiting caller id I have business voice on..   Me: Katy can I help you? Caller: Katy? Me: yaaa??? caller: Do you know who this is? Me: I know who it sounds like caller: Who does it sound like? me: James? James: ya Me: OMG how the hell have you been? James: Don't you wanna know how I got your number? Me: ya that would work James: You called me about my jeep Me: man I knew that was wierd.. Chris's last name showing up on my caller ID James: I'm with Mark's ex Me: AHHH that makes sense James: Ya, I knew it was you but I didn't want to say anything in front of her  Have I mentioned Tommy is God?  So Todd comes in to check out his competition because he's all ready asked about Carl's truck..  So, I was really suprised he had balls enough to actually come in and check it out.  My ex Jeff can't just seem to understand that I have been to michigan probably 5 times since we split up and not one of those times did I call and tell him I was in town.  There was a good reason for that.   I'M DONE!!!   Leave me alone!  How many more times do I gotta tell ya to go away.. I know for a fact you read my blog so just go away.  Why are you doing this to yourself still?? why can't you just GET IT.. You always said Doug never got it.  Now take a look.  YOU will NEVER get it.. Sleep with my blanket every night and wish I was there I don't really care what you do just go away.  You took any possessions I had left from woodstock for yourself.  It's your bed you lie in it with MY blanket on there still.  You really have a lot of growing up to do.  Do you like fucking Nympha on MY blanket, on the bed that WE bought together for an apartment you could no longer stand to live in after I was gone.. Let's review why I left in the first place.. Oh ya cause you didn't want to get a divorce.  So when you try to make ME look like the bad person to who ever u feel you should just remember this.. I gave up just as much as you did, I hurt the one that loved me no matter what, left all my friends and my family, to be with you, and the thanks I got was me realizing that I meant nothing to you.  I just want to thank you for realizing why I left you in the first place.. Phew, now that I got that off my chest.. I feel much better!  Anywho, sex with brian is getting better and better.. good thing I'm marrying the guy huh?

      Powerful feelings of love come welling up within you today, particularly towards family members. Communication between you and those you love is likely to be heightened, dear Sagittarius, as you learn to speak your mind while not being too blunt. Romantic matters could also be thriving at this time, as you'll be in just the mood to want to express your feelings physically. Old friends form stronger bonds with you, while you discover common interests with new friends.

Come open up the fucking door Todd: ok ok ok  Went to the store got some chicken and wild rice soup starter, grilled up some chicken added it and it's on the stove.  Michelle is stopping by later.

      I am officially not talking to my mother until she apologizes!  I've had enough of this family turmoil don't add fuel to the fire bullshit attitude my mom has.  I'm so pissed... Started christmas on her side of the family.. Went to go see diana in the hospital.  Telling us that she doesn't think the jewelery made it.. My heart drops out of my chest.  My mom calls today and she tells me Diana was back in the hospital.  So I asked her if the jewelry ever surfaced.. "why should you care about where her jewelry is".. As if it's really her jewlery.. That was GRAM's not hers.. She took it after Gram died then had the balls to wear just aout all of it to her funueral knowing damn well me and Eileen were livid about how that was handled.  It's not liek u are getting any if something happens.  Why wouldn't I.  You are just the niece... Who would she give it to.. UMM her daughter IN LAW.. You know what mom i'll talk to you later.  Over my dead body is Nancy getting MY grand mother's jewelry.. I can't believe how insignificant my mother jsut made me feel... FUCK her!

      So I don't have to keep repeating myself.......  Talked to the mother of Brian's child (as we like to call her)... Called about claiming Steven on taxes. This was my chance to talk to her aout a whole lot of other issues too and try to get her point of view on stuff.. It wasn't too bad of a talk but some decisions were made that I'm sure Brian will be happy with. She is letting us claim Steve so we can move out of here and move in to at least a two bedroom... She thought that I didn't liek Steven.. That's not even a thought in my head. I just have no where to put him.. Now that she understands that I told her as long as we can get steven in a two bedroom we have no problems taking him on weekends.. The problem is that Brian gets stuck over there works his ass off nothing comes off for the car in the process.. So LAST year we could hae been in a bigger place by now if she let us claim him. Now that she really gets the whole picture she's gonna let us claim steven.  On a side note Venice (Bill and Todd's mom) is FINALLY divorced! WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO! Now thier lives can start. Brian will be happy to hear that when he gets home..  Brian got hired in over at Kmart.. Bill's mom is divorced. I talked to Chrissy.. So far it's a win win, Minus the whole Jim getting upset thing.

      As suspected...  Pissed off my first person about the hike in prices... And the uping in the fronts but I can't do it for less anymore.. This is how I make my money... Sales are up yes but I am only making about $200 on the qp with the way this is going and then i ahve to wait for money I am out before the money is paid and I have to sweat it.  I can't do that any more.. When Brian puts his foot down there's not a whole lot I am going to do to stop that.  He's right tho.  Why should I have to wait weeks/months for money yet they have all ready smoke my weed... Not gonna happen anymore... Rules of the hosue.... Friday ALL money is due.. Can't pay me by Friday too damn bad.  I need either a check or some money down otherwise it's $10 extra.  If the check bounces or I am unable to cash it on Friday $20 fee and $5 a day will be added until it's paid off.  This goes for EVERYONE..  No exceptions.. Sorry guys.. This year i'm taking care of #1.  If i want to open shop in June something has to drastically change around here.  I am not a bank and i refuse to get walked on if this means that i close up shop cause no one can understand this then so be it. I don't want it to happen that way.  But I am fed up.. Last week I had $425 outstanding no weed and couldn't pick up for 2 days... WHY??? I shouldn't have to do that.. This is a business.. Friendships aside this is a business..  I hope you all understand taht's why you are my friend!

      {{{{{{{{{{{{katy}}}}}}}}}}}}  God, i have like ZERO energy.  i'm sick inside.  i guess everything is ok here again, but everything is NOT ok in my head.  i think it's trying 2 kill me again.  everything i look at provokes the question:   could this kill me?   we need 2 get rid of that damn gas oven.  like 2day.    i've made the decision (or rather, my head had made it 4 me, being so fucking unstable i'm like a teenager who's whole world has left her - & we all know how unreasonable teenagers r) that i must go 2 the shrink & get some damn lithium.  they say it's perfectly safe, which is probably not 100% true, but the fact is they've been studying this drug since the 50's, & i myself am not safe in this body, with this head, with these misfiring chemicals.  it's like i will never get out of this one.  like this is the big one, the one that's gonna do me in.  i know it was only made worse by certain events, but the point is i've been slowly inching my way toward complete inability 2 function 4 a few weeks now.  like they say, the risks from the drug r FAR less than the risks from the disease.  i was stupid 2 think, when i first found out that it would just pass over me, that the hormonal changes would not kick my ass in2 the ground in it's beligerant attempt 2 kill me once more.  i was stupid 2 disregard that i'd been feeling this way 4 awhile b4 i found it.    why have i been given this head?  why can't i look at anything & not think of how it could kill me?  why am i so fucking scared 2 even go 2 the bathroom?  i can't stand this anymore & i sure as hell cannot stand myself.

      Allie,      Honey, I know if I were in teh same situation you'd be there for me.  I'm not in the least bit irritated by you.  As a matter of fact, it's mornings like these that make me miss michigan and being only 20 minutes away.  I hate seeing you like this.  It scares me.  I'm here for you just like you are ther for me.  I owuldn't hae it any other way.  Just becareful.. You are way too young to not look at all your options.  Don't make the same mistakes I made.  I love you with all my heart.  Just be smart.  Take care of #1 and 2, he's #3 in this equation.  Make sure u are there for good reasons and not just because you feel sorry for him.  the relationship will never work out... Look what happened to me and Joe... That's why I stayed with him for so long.  Be good to yourself! {{{{{{{{{{Allie Girl}}}}}}}}  Ok I must tell you about my awesomest day ever, I think EVER!!!  Partied a little at Tommy's last night.  Picked up some AWESOME weed.  Hail to Tommy!!  Dropped off an o on the way home Bam $200... Got home porn was on, got stoned, fucked for 2 hours.. Went to bed.. Marla Calls.. Get up and go online until she gets here.  Karen was online.  Flirted with her for like an hour waited wtil marla got here $60.. went back to bed.. Played with brian until Todd calls at 11:15... Brian looses all momentum, answers the phone when todd calls as he's doing me telling him to jsut get over here.  Couldn't get back goign.. He goes in the shower but before that I tell him "If I'm fucking todd when he gets out it's his fault".  His response ok. I slowly started to freak out as my body starts to shake from his response.  I clarified that with him before he stepped in the shower.  Todd gets here..  Me: You're not going to believe what just happened Todd: What Me: When youcalled he was fucking me... Lost all momentum.. apologizes goes to hop in the shower.. I tell him if i am fucking you when he gets out he says it's ok...   Todd: shut up he did not Me: Ask him Todd: ok I will Todd:  Did you say it was ok for me to fuck her? Brian:  I'm suprised her robe was still on Todd: well I didn't believe her adn I really have no time.  Program his card gives me a hug he leaves. Gary flies in $20. Brian gets dressed to leave. Says he has no problems if me and todd do anything. I'm very shakey legged by the whole idea. He's walking out the door and I tell him he's dead on sunday.. He goes I know.  I'm banking on it and that he hopes I get some of it out of my system.  As if that wasn't good enough...  Gloria stopped by.. we are ok.. At least for the time being... Showed her the survey.  Thought it was cool.. Where's carl been??  The phone rings and it's carl.  He's in town and coming up.. Gloria leaves $60  Kathy shows up, $15.  Jimmy shows up.. All but like $100 of rent.  Carl will be here $60 Linda $30.. Rent paid..  David is right here.. Gonna go to Ikea I hope I hope I hope.  Stop at unfuckers AGAIN with his box... By then Carl should be here.. Could this day get any better?

      i just wanted 2 say that i Love u very very much, Katy.  thank u 4 everything 2night  (or, rather, this morning) u have no idea what it means 2 me.  i'm sorry if i was being a bitch but i really think my whole entire world is falling apart right now.  & nothing is gonna change my mind if this is over - i am not having a baby on my own.  besides, u don't want me pregnant 4 the wedding, do u?  let us just thank Heaven & the powers that be if this is over that it is over now & not in two months.  my dad is here now so i'm relatively safe from myself & have stopped destroying the house.  all i wrecked completely was an end table that was falling apart anyway, half a kitchen chair & knocked a buncha keyes off the keyboard, which i should be able 2 fix if i can find them all.  all in all, a very mild psychotic episode.  i'm guessing the stupid fuck is either passed out drunk somewhere or in jail as he didnt respond 2 the threat of me killing his fish.  doesn't make this any easier, & i guess i owe it 2 a third party (the baby) 2 find out what the fuck really happened.  if it werent 4 that i'd like 2 think i'd be gone but i cannot feasibly belive that he would just up & do something like this intentionally 2 hurt me.  of course, i've been wrong hundreds of times b4, but if i'm right, it's worth staying & trying 2 figure this all out.  it really is.  i cannot 4get that the last thing he said 2 me was 'I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH'.  i'm so tired & confused & lost & mentally unstable & shaky & nauseous & about a trillion other negative things but 4 some reason i still have hope way deep down inside & that hope seems 2 be manifesting it's self out of intuition & a woman's intuition is more valid than any other - escpecially when it comes 2 her man... so i stay & wait... & wait... & wait...  & try not 2 cry.   {{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{katy}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}

      There are mini polls posted below the tag board.. have at it... remember all answers are confidental.  there are several so in order to get another one u need to hit refresh.  I'll be adding them as i go there are about 5 or 6 now.  Michael gave me www.prideintheheart.com.. I realize with a .com name like that it has to be something special.  The only thing that is really special to my ehart are my friends even tho some days I wonder why I bother.  So I am working on a survey for all of them to take.  Since most of my friends are either VERY single, or wanting to be single, I'm making them a survey to put up.  Post a pic ofo thier choosing.  And then that is THIER web page.  Thier profile.  They can share the link with anyone they choose and all of my friends.  It's a good way to get to figure out why I am friends with these people.  They are all good apples and this will be thier opp. to show you why.

      So is it a bad thing to REALLY REALLY miss Todd??? Even tho he was my last hug of 2003 the more I think about it it was really cold like.  Seemed like he was pissed we were there or something.  I dunno very strange.  Him and Bill are stopping by so hopefully i can squeeze in a few minutes to ask him what was up.  I get to see carl on Tuesday.  I have to somehow come up with $247 that we are short due to poker/christmas/new years/walmart/gas LOL....   On the very WRONG note... I was watching porn the other morning.. Went in the shower cam out, and there was this asain broad fucking a midget... Completely wrong but funny none the less.. Thought I'd share.. New satelite script is in get it while it's hot.

      an after thought here's my horoscope  Sagittarius Romance Scope - Female Thu Jan. 1, 2004  On this New Year's Day, the current planetary aspect may dampen your enthusiasm for a certain relationship, but don't let this put you off from giving it a second chance. If you feel despondent about the way things have gone recently, and feel in need of some reassurance, then it may be time to do some serious talking. This, more than anything, will restore your spirits, even though you will both be quite serious. In the midst of all of this, don't forget that a wonderful New Year is just beginning for you.

      Well the last hug of the year was Todd.. AWww how cute!  Brian and I fucked in the new year the way it should be!  I get to see carl Tuesday.  Edder stopped by and said he's done selling!  I can't believe it!  Good for him!  I support all my friends in EVERYTHING they do.. Good bad or otherwise..  So this year I am running this like a business.  $428 outstanding and rent is due today $500.  This is out of control!  No one owes me a lot of money.  But $25 adds up.  I'm going to resort to posting it on my blog until shit is paid.  After getting totally  blown off from everyone it's time to reevaluate friendships again.  That's my new years resolution to myself.  The longer I sit and think about it the more pissed off i get.  We made it a point to go see Gloria and Bill for new year's eve when we didnt' REALLY want to leave in the first place.  We wanted to be back and done by 6 but oh well no big deal.  Stopped and bought about $30 in alcohol for everyone to blow me off... So I'm just VERY aggervated!    I think this is the first time In a year that I haven't talked to Gloria.  It kills me.  I'm not going to be walked over by anyone anymore.  It's not just you Glor.  Please just let me finish before my phone rings.  David does the same shit once that T bird is paid off I'm DONE.  When I'm done it's not pretty.  I feel like there isn't a person around me that hasn't treated me like shit for no reason whatso ever but that just doesn't have any respect for anyone around them.  I give someone a $125 hard to find car part and instead of putting it in the house they leave it on the engine of thier car with the hood up basically saying please take me.  I'm not supposed to be mad about that, or about getting completely blown off.  David continuously blows me off for HOURS AND HOURS and then I am supposed to drop everything for him.. I'm done.. If brian wants to spend any time with bill he has to go up there!  He's lucky he's moving.  Allison constantly blows me off on a weekly basis.  The only one i can totally count on anymore seems to be Rich, Allie and Michelle when she's not in school.  Then you all wonder why I am best friends with Rich... Hummm lets see...  Tonyhas fallen of the face of the earth again.. Guess he found himself a new piece of ass so I'm just the girl he used to know all over agian.    I'm over emotional today.. I guess it's that time of the month or something.  So take that in to consideration..  That doesn't change the fact that people's behaviors that I care VERY deeply about are hurting me very much and no one takes 5 minutes to give a shit!  I'm mother hen WAY too much.. I really gotta not give a shit.. How do you do that with people that have changed my life so much thatI'm not sure who I'd be with out them.  I know right nwo I'm miserable with most fothem but it's like they say abotu family.. You gotta love them not necessarily like them... Good moto to live by

      Below are a few poems that has captured my heart and has been the inspiration for 80% of my poetry.  When I find the rest I will post them.. Poetry is the way to my heart and soul..  Without it we are dead.  If you read thes then read MY poems you will have a good understanding of who I am.  I am working on figuring out how to link my archieved poetry.  The entire list should be accessable by the end of the project.  I think I will start up another blog that is poetry of the heart.. That would be the poetry that makes me write and feel the way I do.  Sometimes you can not put in to words what your feel because someone else has all ready written it.  Have fun enjoy.  Expand your mind for a little bit.    Amazing how productive I can be when I am really stoned. Never once in a hundred million years would I have thought that really good weed will make me this productive.  I cleaned off my desk and taped down Gloria's kid's pictures.  This way I can always keep my eye on them even when I am not there.  I need a pic of Brandon..  Maybe I'll come up there and snap a bunch of pictures for you and me.  I really hate being this far away.  It really does kill me I can't watch my kids grow up.  I really feel in my heart you and I could raise these kids a whole lot better than having Steve there.  They don't need a dad like that around them Glor. They need a stable enviroment.  I might not be the best answer, but I'm going to do my best to give those kids everything they deserve.  A good chance in life.  I'm gonna get this shit giong if it's the last thing I do.  I will do EVERYTHING it takes to get rid of steve.  Not for any other reason but the fact that you deserve so much better and you are cutting yourself VERY short by dealing with him.  I know financially you can't do it on your own YET.  I promise that will change!  I promise I will make it easy for you to leave him when the time is right.  It;s going to be a lot sooner than later.  I realized this week that I need you and the kids in my life to make me happy and right nwo honestly that's all that matters to me.  So everything I'm doing now is to help us have a better 30 years than the lst and realy learn from our mistakes.  Just have a little faith in me.  I pray everyday that God gives me enough strength to do what my heart tells me I should have been doing all along.  All I need is a little faith to tell me that what I am doing is right.  Allie I love you so much.  I'm so blessed to have you in my life.  You are truely the most honest to God down to earth sweetest thing I have ever met.  You have the biggest heart out of everyone I know.  You are as forgiving as I am, and that is hard to find in a person.  You are truely a work of art that is absolutely priceless and wouldn't have it any other way.  God has blessed you with someone as important as you are to me.  Do the right thing.  Stop smoking cigarettes, get yourself some really good weed and realize that now is the time make your life yours and not listen to the voices in your head.  You have been blessed with a child like I have been blessed with the best friend in the whole wide world.  Don't be wreckless.  Be good to yourself and it will come back to you ten times fold.  David you are truely my angel sent from heaven.  I mean that from teh very bottom of my soul.  I know everything will be ok.  I'm not sure how, but everything seems to work itself out.  I know you can see right through me.  For the first time ever I am not afriad of that.  There is a lot of comfort in that.  II know you knwo what i am thinking without even saying a word.  It's taken me a life time to find a friend like that.  I'm going to do everything in my power to never let you go.  Carl if you want in my life prove it.  I can't handle this silent treatment control freak stuff you are pulling on me.  You are ripping me apart.  Just stop.  We are either friends or not.  My door is open it's up to you.  Whatever you think this is will come to a really fast end if you don't start telling me why you close me out so fast.  So just knock it off!  I don't want you out of my life, but if this is how you treat your friends I'd rather be your enemy.  I'm not sure why you are so scared.  Whatever the reason is you better get over it.  This can turn in to just a business relationship really fast.  If that's the way you wantit that's the way it will be.  Just gotta say the word.  I know this is over mushy and a tad out of character.  I've been very self absorbed last few weeks and I'm sorry for that.  Right now I'm just doing what I have to do.  All I'm asking for is a whole lot of patience right now from everyone to realize I'm not trying to be cold hearted or stand offish.  I'm trying to tie up loose end relationships with other people.  I'm trying to make Arlyn realize that Wendy is the best thing that's EVER happened to him.  I got rid of Rich all together.  The rest of the crew I know isn't going anywhere anytime soon and that's all good.  I'm opening some of my life up back to Michigan Jeff, not for anything more than a business deal.  I realized that i really miss him, but I don't miss us.  If that makes any sense to anyone.

      Ok incase anyone misse it My dad (Mr. Cleaver) had a mild heart attack while on a cruize in the Bahamas and was air lifted to Clevland Heart hospital in Ft. Lauderdale ($7100 later).  Mr. and Mrs. Cleaver are doing good.  I went down to Florida orginally to meet up with David and just so happened that my dad was having chest pains all at the same time.  So turned it in to a rea long few days but all is well.  We got back Friday and I've pretty much been recouping ever since.  I got some really nice dank from the band kids and some hash to go with it.  Going to mom and dad's for dinner.  Then I plan on staying home and getting completely fucked up because I can!  It's been an excrutiating long week.  I could sit here and rant and rave about the floridiots, or bitch about how stupid brian really is, but i'm just not in the mood.  Trying to get some good energy back in to the house.  I need to ground myself for a little bit and just relax.  A whole shit load of new poems were written and posted.  check out the archives for older stuff if you get bored.  Next weekend David and I are going to toronto.  That should be fun.  Allison's hubby says we can get seeds up there.  Better believe it!  Hugs n stuff love you guys great big huge huge huge bunches.

      first off...  thank u Gloria 4 u're words of encouragement.  they r much appreciated.  ;oD    second:  KATY WHEN R U COMING HOME?  I MISS U DAMNIT!!!!  & U NEVER CALLED ME BACK U ASS!!!  ;oP  thirdly,  they cancelled my damn appointment.  okee, so i could finally breathe when they called 45 minutes b4 i was supposed 2 be there & told me this.  but it pisses me off cuz my blood pressure went up 4 no damn reason, i was on the fucking verge of a panic attack 4 half the fucking day 4 NO DAMN REASON, & i found out this appointment is not with the doctor, but with a nurse, who will oh-so-graciously talk 2 me about pregnancy, show me a video & take my blood.  gee thanks, u think maybe i could actually get in2 see a living breathing doctor b4 i actually give birth?  i mean really, this is fucking rediculous.  i'm estimating that i'm about 3 months pregnant now & don't u think that maybe...JUST MAYBE it would be more productive 2 have an exam than 2 watch a stupid movie?  maybe my priorities r messed up, but it seems completely logical 2 me.  on another note, i have not shit in FIVE DAYS.  yes, i've been throwing up quite frequently but still i think i get the equivalent of at least one meal down me a day.  this means there r FIVE MEALS just sitting inside me, festering, poisoning me.  no wonder i'm fucking puking.  anyway, 2day i bought some metamucil apple crisp wafers (which i swear r made of glycerine or something as they turn 2 some sort of thick jello-y substance once chewed & remain stuck 2 u're teeth until u sandpaper it off with u're toothbrush), & a box of all-bran (u know, that cereal made entirely of twigs - u'd think they'd have the decency 2 at least grind them up & process them in2 some shape other than a stick) which i will proceed 2 eat the whole damn box of if these metamucil jello 'wafers' do not do the trick by 2morrow morning.  i am in pain & i feel like my fucking abdomen is going 2 explode.  i KNOW 4 a fact the all bran will make me shit cuz when i was about 14 (& locked in  he looney bin, 4bidden 2 throw up thier marshmellow & coleslaw suprise) my roomate & i got this bright idea that we'd go on an all all-bran diet.  well, about an hour after lunch we were both glued 2 the toilet, the twigs running though us like water.  who knew sticks were good 4 anything?  4 some reason we continued on that diet anyway 4 the next day & a half, afterwards reverting back 2 puking 2gether in our waste basket & stealthily sneaking the bag in2 the bathroom under our robes & dumping the guck in2 the toilet 2-3 times daily.  so much 4 24 hour observation ;oP.    i know everyone in the WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD wanted 2 hear all about that, so i gladly obliged.  until next time: have a beautifully wonderful life & 4 God's sake, SMOKE A WHOLE FUCKING OUNCE 4 ME!!!

      Started when brian left on Friday and I have been going non stop ever since.  It's so not like me to sit at home.  Really it's not.  That's why I had to join pool.  At least it's 4 people I geniunely like.  Friday this place was a fucking mad house.  I turned over total 735 in 1 hour.  That' no lie.  Everyone and thier mother were here.  Who didn't show up last night seems to be showing up tonight.  Which is fine except i'm dry.    Carl came out last night.  All I can say is he makes me very happy.  Him just being here.  Just chillin on the couch talkin' makes me happy.  I really don't want anything more han what we have.  What we have is PERECT.  I think he's realized that i am reall ok with him and I.   He was able to relax for the first time in a long time.  That was very comforting.  What am I going to do about brian?  God I wish I really knew.  I'm taking in alot of advice about how to handle it.  I think he's just not going to be able to be here on the weekends.  I can't be an overgrown babysitter 24-7-356.  I can't he's burning me out.  If he doesn't leave on the weekends all we do is fight.  I hate fighting.   Really I do.  I just can't handle the stupidity anymore.  I'm done being wierd about it.  It's really just time to let him go for a while.  He's gotta learn how to live without me.  I'm not kicking him out.  Just need my weekends.  if it comes down to i can't even handle him for a few days that's when i know it's over.  Talked to bill about him.  He was actually very comforting for the first time ever.  actually gained a little respect for him.  Not alot but some.  Saturday thus far...... Took David's mom, sister and niece to the airport.  Went out to unfuckers sat and chit chatted with him for a while.  I so love him I really do.  When he finally does pass away I'm REALLY gonna miss him.  He's like the grandpa I never had.  I know it won't be too long.  He looked horrible today.  Even gave him a hug just because.. normally don't do that.  I'm waiting on Brian to get home so me him and steve can go out for dinner.  I'm not sure where he thinks we are going to eat on valentine's day but whatever.  After that I'm going out with Juan from pool.. Need to just get out of the house for a while with some intelligent conversation..  Wish wendy was coming out.  I REALLY wish carl would come out.  I really don't see that happening.  There's the defense mechinism kicking in.  That's ok me and Juan will go hang out.  He;s very cool.. Now that I'm starting to get to know him I like him even more.  Not to mention he's a really good pool player.  Even better!  But no worries guys he's JUST a friend and I know he doesn't have a girlfriend so I figured might as well see if he's busy.  Seeing as how David is in Orlando, Brian has Steven, and Carl had 3 hockey games and working today.  Edder is down at the auto show waiting for him to show up so I can push it over.  Gonna go to Joyce's and shoot some pool with Juan I think.

      last night we made a trip 2 media play.  alan wanted 2 get some role playing/adventure game thingie.  kept telling me how cool it would be cuz we could play it 2gether.  well, turns out he just wanted 2 create worlds.  kinda like me with the sims.  so...  the thing ended up being $40 & we didn't get it, but instead he bought me Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets.  it was only $10.  i waited 'til 7:30 this morning 2 grab the puter.  yes, i have my laptop but the thing seems 2 have developed a strong dislike of me & either freezes or shuts itself off at the worst moments possible, so i tend 2 just leave it be.  anyway, i'm SOOO looking 4ward 2 playing this game on a system that kicks everyone else's ass.  i install it - no problems.  then go 2 start the game.  'plaese enter the cd-rom'  ok... well, obviously the cd is in the damn drive because i used the auto run 2 get 2 the start-up screen.  it goes as far as 2 give me the screen that says 'register'; 'play'; 'quit'; 'tech support' & then when i click play i get that stupid 'please insert cd in2 the cd-rom drive'.  FUCK U!!!  FUCK U & U'RE DAMN MAGIC SPELLS.  WHAT KINDA WIZARD R U THAT U CAN'T EVEN START UP A GAME?  okee.  so it sucks ass.  i was sooooo incredibly dissapointed.  around lunch i called alan & told him.  stupid stupid fucking game.  he asks me what i want him 2 do about it.  well, nothing, considering he's at work.  (which sucks ass as well seeing as it's valentine's day & it just sucks in general that he has 2 work on the weekends).  he tells me 2 try it in my laptop.  so...  after reading 4 awhile & trying 2 (unsuccessfully) repress my extreme nausea i finally install it in the stupid fucking piece of shit laptop that cost 3 times more than my dad's car & it works.  it even starts.  i get all in2 the game, been playing 4 like a half hour & then harry just WON'T MOVE.  i'm yelling at him like an idiot, "Harry, what the hell is wrong with u?"  "c'mon harry.... FUCKING MOVE!!!!" & then the puter decides 2 shut it'self off.  yup.  like magic.  damn harry 2 hell.  so now i'm sitting here with no cable (which means no abfab).  no harry.  no alan.  & the most severe nausea i've had in weeks (actually - last night was the worst.  i was so nauseous my vision was blurring & then when we came home from dinner i was gonna cut up some beef heart 4 the fish & barely made it 2 the sink b4 i projectile vomitted all around the sink, on the curtains & up the kitchen window.  actually - i was kinda funny.  funnier still that the sight & smell of vomit doesn't make me puke but the smell of beef heart does).  i'm just waiting 4 him 2 get home now so i can give him the FIVE DOLLAR card i got him (one of the cheapest they had if u can believe it & i didn't even go 2 hallmark), the bouncing devil & the year's suplly of chocolate covered cherries.    s'cuse me, have 2 puke again.

      that's just a little message 4 all the losers in the world who do nothing but sit at home & try 2 hack in2 other people's puters.  really, how can one possible grow, or do anything worthwhile by participating in such a stupid activity?  it's frightening though, 2 think of how many people must have actually gotten in2 the puter b4 we had this firewall up.

      woah.  it's like friday the 13th & stuff.  so i get this email from Sharon.  her & jessi broke up.  i'm assuming this is a recent development & that they will get back 2gether.  not that it has anything 2 do with me, it was just wierd 2 hear that.  called her @ work as soon as i got the email (which oddly was just as i was sitting down 2 the puter after a two hour read & a shower - oh & making a cup of 'cafe caramel', which btw, was one of a great number of coffee/latte/cappacino mixes half off at farmer crack's last night - is good shit i tell u!) but she was leaving, asked me 2 call her at some unfamilliar number in an hour or so.  so... i'll call her.  she always takes the time out 2 talk 2 me when i'm going through a big mess.  or should i say when i'm going through a big mess & reach out 2 someone.  it's funny cuz when we were 2gether i never used 2 open up 2 her, but now i feel like i can tell her anything, even things i don't tell other people.  there's some shit that's happened that only her & Rich know about.  no offense 2 anyone else, it's just, she knows me & how i am in a relationship, & has had more personal experience with my fucked up head than anyone else i know & then i needed a guys advice on things.  not that he ever gave me advice on the subject, but if it had been really bad i'm sure he woulda smacked me in the face with some testosterone-laced knowledge.  LOL.  sometimes it's funny 2 think of him as a guy.  he's not typical at all.  of anything.  ;oP  *sigh* hopefully 2night is better than last night where i felt like shit run over by a dump truck that had spilled decaying rot all upon me.  physically, i felt that way i mean.  other than that, things r going pretty peachy.    thank u & have a beautifully wonderful day

      Why is it i can't just have 2 running cars?  I just spent $50 on tires so I have a car to drive.  NOW we were going down Drury Lane and we hear tink tink tink, metal bolt.  Whatever it was instantaniously killed the car and won't start.  I mean really am I destined to just be in shit forever.  Mike gets 2 brand new trucks and a boat paid for and I have to struggle with my cars all the fucking time.  I am so fucking aggervated.   My dad asks Brian if we can afford a car payment.  I'm not sure maybe my dad finally will cave in and cosign for me.  It's just like What the hell ever I can't deal with this shit no more.  Stop putting me in $1500 beaters that I end up spending $2000 on repairs.  I can't stand it anymore.  I'm so aggervated I'm screaming inside.  As soon as this fucking thing is fixed I'm selling it!

      The mom in you will come out when she needs to right now you have to be the mother and the father because the father doesn't know his ass from a hole in the wall.. Between being the mother and the father and working full time you still seemto find time to be a mom.  That is the best quality of all not to mention the best friend someone could ask for.

      beautiful work.  I think, it's not about the number of poems you write, but how much feeling you put in to them when youdo them. If you feel complete afterwards it's a good piece.

      k... those next two entries r poems i wrote over the past month.  finally got em typed out so i figured i should put them somewhere.  i've got another one, it's kick ass & blew me away when i found it (apparently i had written it a few months back & 4got about it) but it's on a loose piece of paper & i've lost it again.

      I think my new happy thought is when Carl calls me at 10am from my driveway. It always seems to take him like 5 minutes to tell me he's outside.  I love that.  I really do.. That means he was thinking of me at least a few hours before I even got up.  He's gotta plan his time to have time to come up here.  He's such a virgo!  I wouldn't change ya even if I could so stop sweating the small stuff.

PrideInTheHeart: AWWWWWWWWWWW  See that's sooooooooooo sweet.. What guy can compare to my brother?  I'm tellingya glor we had him pegged years ago.    I really really really think carl gets it.  And I reall really really think brian never will.  He knows he has to shit or get off the pot.  He definately needs to get off the pot.  and if he shits be better clean it up cause i probably won't be here to do that.  Anyway, funny how life can just slap you in the face.. love you guys!

      Brian was crying in the shower this morning at 6am.  WTFE!!! God i so can not handle this over emotional basket case any more.  I love him very much but I can not live with him any more.  He gives me anxiety and that's what I am trying to get rid of.  Carl calls from my driveway.  I so love mornings like that.  That means he was thinking of me a few hours before hand.  That means more to me than he realizes.  It makes me that much more done with dumbass.  Gloria comes here in the middle of the day.  I love those afternoons just chillin'.  Makes me realize what friends are for.  Now he's home getting ready to dump a bunch of chemicals in to the regal to get it started unstead of just trying to jump it first.. BOYS are sooooooooo stupid... I'll tell you about my week later.  Wrestling is on tonight!

      Well if I GAVE you this link then welcome to my next 30 yeras.  If you don't have this link then there is a REALLY good reason why not.  But then you wouldn't be reading this unless you were a blog surfer.  If that's the case then you are in for a treat.  I have all my friends blogs, poetry and lyrics listed on the right.  I needed to get rid of dead weight and decided that this was the only way to do it.  Just get a new address.  This way all them damn aol people will just leave me alone.  Rich is GONE, Foxtrot GONE, Kat GONE, Eric GONE Michigan Jeff GONE, as well as a few others that just don't seem to get it.  Oh yea and Brian and Bill will be S.O.L. too.  shit happens!  Now i can talk freely about Brian without the worry that Bill will tattle on me.  I can speak more freely in general without hurting people's feelings cause I tal about them.  It's needed to be done for quite some time now.  I know I'm such a Sagi procrastinator.  Life should run MUCH smoother now.  I just can't stand having to run and hide from people because they won't go away.  This way I am only running from the ones I want to run from and should have run from years ago.  All these people I mentioned have just been dead weight.  Time to bury them alive (so to speak).    I will be getting everyone prideintheheart.com email addresses as soon as I get my shit together from being gone.  I will help you set up your outlook on your puter to recieve emails on that account.  Look out you might actually get a real address book. ANYHOW... When I get home I will be putting up prideintheheart.com webpages and ask you to fill out my survey.  IT will be a good thing to do even if it takes you forever.  It will give you an insight to what you are looking for out of life as well as a look back on things you love.  I should be home Wednesday night late.  The house is all painted waiting on Jimmy to do an inspection.  Once that is done I'm so kicking Brian out.  He's really just too dumb.  Honest.  I just can't stand to talk to him now even.  He's just annoying.  He's a buzzkill.  He's just DONE.  He's so far done that he doesn't even know it because I care that little about getting rid of him.  Ryan is gonna end up helping me out when I go out of town.  The cats love him to death and he likes them.  MOST of you know him so the ones that don't should.  He's gonna be might right hand man cause I need someone to do it and Layla and Lonnie like him.    If rich calls any of you or asks you any questions about me tell him to drop dead!  He sent me a very serious threat letter after nottalking to him for 3 months.  Saying that he is contacting authorities and such, including my parents.  So I told my parents to just ignore him.  I told Joyce just to ignore him.  I have an email I sent to Rich in reply basically saying if you are that lonely get a life and leave me alone.  So, there's no reason to be nice to him.  Just go for it all those years of frustration u can lay on him he's free game.  If any of my officers are rading this you can take him off my list!  Mikey you got your wish, have at it!   David and I are going to the farm the weekend after Easter.  All parties interested in joining me better speak up now.  Don't say I  never invite you guys.  I should be doing concrete cleaning applications for David starting next week.  Hopefully working for my dad next week too.  At least getting excel up and running so I can do it if they want me to.  If anyone's been to Kay's you know what I am talking about by her house needs some Random Madnees but not a whole damn house's worth.  I think I am going to go over there and start purging old files and such.  I'm sitting in Ty's office doing email and blogging and stuff so u can all still get me on David's cell.  I should have my own Nextel cell by monday.

      The web address will no longer post to aranetta.blogspot.com.  There is a new address to go to.  Also new addresses for all the poetry and Lyrics also.  Everything else remains the same.  After you get done posting view blog.  Then save that address as the new blog address.  Some might ask why I would do that.  Well I'm gonna fill you all in.  I've realized over the years people have nothing better to do than to read thru old archives.  I am not sure why my ex boyfriends or ex best friends would care about something I said over a few years but what ever.  I am doing this so they can end a chapter in thier lives and loose what's so important to them.  They seem to think they still have some control over my life if they know my daily routine and habits.  So instead of letting them still hold on to something they screwed up I am changing addresses.  That's all there is to it.  I don't need them coming back in to my life because of something I said in a personal blog.  SO in order to stop this from continuously happening I am ending this address as of right now.  I can not believe that all you men out there really have nothing better to do then to read my blog still trying to hold on to some part of my life because you are pissed off at yourself that you screwed up.  There are more than 2 of you doing it to yourselves.   I really don't get that. I mean why would you read my blog months later after you fuck up.  Instead of just calling and apologizing or admitting you miss me.  You drive yourself crazy reading way too much in to things I say on my journal.  If you don't like what's being typed about they you can leave.  But seeing as how you just must read it I'm doing you a favor by changing the address.  If you would like a link to the new site please email aranetta@yahoo.com.  If I'm not wanting you in my life you'll know.

      I'm home I'm home I'm home!!!!  Home sweet home there's nothing like it in the world.  Nice and peaceful, serene, a tad lonely but not too awful bad thank God for speed dial and unlimited long distance.  Gloria I'd be so bored without you..  I can't wait to do Friday slumber parties.  Wendy might be joining us.  It;s so nice to have another witch in my life.   I called Mother Witch and she didn't answer the phone today but I left a cookie Wendy and I made.  I wrote a long ass letter to Arlyn.  I really hope he reads it and doesn't just flip the switch and do a jackal and Hyde thing to me.  It was a Gloria approved letter.  Just basically saying what I've been telling Gloria for like 13 years.  This is my first letter to him like this.  I'm not sure what his reaction's gonna be.  I figured Allison left for Florida, so I need to mend a heart for a while.  I hope he's gentle with me.    David I'd be so fucked without you.  Thank you so much for just being you.  You are my heaven sent angel.  Everyone needs one.  I think I'm Arlyn's he always seems to come to me when he needs me the most.  I always need you.  You ground me.  Thank you for having indefinite patience.  Chris, all I can say is you're VERY welcome.. You know what I'm talking about :).  Just remember to walk away from him in your dreams and I promise it will go away!  Allie, missed you heaps and heaps!  I'm leaving for Toronto on Sunday.  Maybe I'll see you next week along with Mr. Lucke  Bitch, what the hell is wrong with your cell phone?!?!?!?!?!?!?  Unfucker, miss ya, I'll come down and see ya when the cards go out.  I have tons to tell you.  Pics of the house are available upon request.

      ok, so i know Round Lake is not exactly Detroit in terms of lawbreaking...  but does anyone really actually believe the cops would give a shit about about a diary - that if i'm not mistaken - was not stolen but left behind somewhere?!?!?  give me a fucking break.  not 2 mention the fact that it isn't this eric's diary 2 begin with.  the cops would prolly arrest HIM 4 lack of intelligence.    SHeeSH!!!

      Really it's not that I don't love him.  I just can't deal with him anymore.. So I'm still gonna have him as my salesman for you up north people.  Carl's in my head so far that my strongest walls are crumbling very fast.  I see so many other people I know in him.  He's an old soul.  For the first time Igot a piece of his tonight.  At it's really a great feeling.

      Gloria showed up nice and early! That was so cool!  I'm so glad she came over.  Really that was so much fun.. "Do I bitch?"  She actually asked me that with a straight face after David got done bitching about Brian.  I"m like hey now I bitch about Steve as much as David bitches about Brian.  She actually asked me "do I bitch?"  I laughed so hard I about peed my pants.  Ryan was here giving a play by play on the cats fucking.  I called david about 6:00 talked to him he told me to call the lady about the house.  Old lady:Hello Me: Well hi there how are you? Old Lady:  I'm good oh I thought you were my girlfriend Me:  Well I could be if you let me move in. Old Lady: Ok you got the house.  I was worried about the cats Me:  I swear on my grandmother's grave you won't be disappointed.  then we agreed on the money and everything... So it's mine!  I can't remember the order, but Chantel stoped by.  So nice to see her.  Marla came over Jeff met us over at marla's to fix some eletrical shit in the kitchen.  Then we came back here talked for a little while.  Hector showed up and left Jeff left about 10.  Been a nice quiet no Brian sort of night.  Sent him up to Bill's he needed the road trip.  The bird will be flying Saturday.  I don't care how but it will be up and running.  Talked to Eric.. He's so fucking funny I swear to God.  The best news of the day.. Kat got married to that Logan guy last week.  So i called David about 1:30 to tell him.. He wasn't thrilled but at the same time he was laffing too.  Anyway, just got done talking to Michelle online so I'm going to attempt to go get some sleep waiting for these pm's to kick in.  Laffed myself in to a headache with the whole Kat thing.  I think I might lock the cats up so I get a good night's sleep.  I'm gonna need it!  Tomorrow is packing day.

      I know some of you have heard me talking about Wendy.  I just kind of wanted to get all my thoughts together in one place.  So everyone kind of has an idea of the way she is.  She's kind of like the missing piece ofmy heart when allie moved back home.  She's the scorpio I need to ground me.  Kind of like the missing piece to the puzzle.  Like the part of the family that's been missing since I lost my little shoppe up in  Antioch.  I'm really so blessed that she's in my life.  So you all better get used to her she's not going anywhere.

      Note the time of this blog.. I'm just now thinking about maybe trying to go to sleep.  Ryan JUST left from a long ass hard hitting bong session... I just asked my bro Aris.. How's life... And he's actually talking to me.. . I just realized that I really have shit to get done tomorrow so I can't be up anymore but not remotely tired...  So I figured I'd just do a quick time check for everyone.  *immaculately stoned*

      So I went to Florida with teddy... I had every intensions of getting him all sewn up.  He's been needing surgery for quite some time.  My mother keeps tracks.. She seems to think that every seem on him's been sewn up at least twice now.  ANYhow, So ya I'm 30 years old still have my teddy bear from when I was in grade school.  He's a well traveled bear, but nothing could prepare him for what eh was about to embark.  I pulled out of a hotel room with my bag and quilt, no teddy.  I called them somewhere around Tennessee to have him shipped.  The hotel shipped him post office c.o.d.  The mail lady rang David's door bell.  I have a c.o.d. for $11.08.  Pam didn't have any cash on her and doesn't have a checking account.  So Teddy ended up back at the Grayslake p.o.  So, Pam tells me on Saturday that my teddy bear is being held captive for $11.08 ranson by the Grayslake p.o.  After I got done laffing my ass off, I asked David when he was going to go get Teddy.  He just now brought him back.  I opened the box up, flipped it upside down and bruizer has found the only place toby can't fit.  In the same box my Teddy came in how cute is that?

      Are you busy seeking? Or are you coming to some very definite conclusions by now? You think you know what you want, but sometimes life has a way of surprising you, just when you are about to achieve a long-held dream. Take extra care on Monday when Mercury, your partnership planet, squares Pluto, in your own sign. Someone might try to get the better of you, but they could come out worse. It's not you that could come to any harm, but rather the person who dares to tangle with you.

      To move out of that house or kick him out so u aren't so miserable.  He will never get it. He's like brian neither one will ever amount to much of anything and will be working minimum wage.  Not that they aren't sweet when they want to be but when they are assholes look the fuck out.  your life is more important than living like that.  Your children'slives should be more important.  It's not thier fault that he's a looser.why make you and your kids deal with someone that doesn't care about them?  How do I know that.. when he was living on his own you were happier, the kids weren't holy terrors and I came up there awhoel lot more often.  I love you so much glor just don't want to see you waste your life away to some looser that will never appreciate what you do for him, much like brian will never truely appreciate what i do for him.

      I called Carl at like 1:30 in the morning when I got out of the bar.  I know he was in Sand Diego when I called.  I left an I miss you message.  I'm not sure what happened in between then and when I went to sleep but he was here in the morning.  Stayed until about 11.  Brian came home.  He left.  Brian and I fought from 11am til about 2pm.. He was very mean.  Very over emotional.  Admitted to lying to me about school, and about a lot of other things too.  His last words out of the house were if you want your space fine you can have it and left.  All I asked him was if he got a form in the mail saying that he was not eligible for EIN.  I thought that was a pretty yes or no answer.  He's like no what dont' u believe me?  I'm like um no I just was wondering if they gave you any forms saying u are no longer eligible.  He got all mad at me for "accusing him" of lying.. He just can't really understand. He made that very evident today. I really can not do this anymore.  I decided on the awesome house out in island lake.  I need all my resources right now for $1000 to move in by the 15th.  So after hanging out with David from like 3:00 - 8:00 or so Carl calls.  He's on his way up.  Allison shows up and leaves Ryan leaves by like 8:30 Carl's here by then.  He knows I'm really done with Brian now.  I actually took him in to the bedroom.  All I can say is ALLLLLLL fucking righty then!  Should have done it months ago... Called Glor, called Wendy, called Bitch Dave, Trisha called from new york.  Somewhere in the mix of all that......... oh lord here we go AGAIN.... I'm talking to foxtrot again.  I really have come to the conclusion that I am not going to close my doors to anyone when they seem genuine.  I told him all the things I've been preaching about the last few months.  He was like I think i can handle that.  I called carl before I got on here and told him that I really enjoyed our time today and it was 2:30 in the morning and I wanted him to be the last thought before bed.. So there he is once again.  All warm and fuzzy added lyrics for foxtrot.. Gonna add some for carl tomorrow.

      I really don't care who knows about it.  Who's hurt by it and who thinks they are going ot be a hateful jealous bastard and get in the middle of it.  He makes me laugh and smile and blush and physically and mentally happy.  He's not a BOYFRIEND yet.  I don't want to put a definition on it just yet.  Yes, I am learning from my mistakes.  We just fit together.  A lot like me and Arlyn used to, but more grown up sort of way.  He makes me feel good and fills my head.  That's what a relationship is supposed to be like.  The only one that ever did that was Doug.  Brian did but it wasnt' the same.  Like Doug sexually made me very very happy but everything else was wrong.  This is the first tiem ever that everything just seems to be right.  He understands I am trying to pull myself out of a hole I created for myself.  It's all good!

      Well Monday me and unfucker came up with business cards got his printed up for now.  Mine will be printed once the ar is loading up rides.  They are really cool black background with white letters with instructions on the back.  I'm gonna be driving a sedan for a few weeks until we for sure are getting financed thru billy maize.  For those of you who don't know who billie maize is he owns vegas on the limos.  no limo in vegas runs without his name on it.  So anyway, Larry is trying to do all this himself.  I finally yelled at him and told him to stop working so hard let me help him.  Late nights and busy days on meds doens't work too well.. He didnt' look so hot the other day.  He's like the grandpa I never had it kills me that Ralphie is killng him when I can do somethign to stop it if he'd just let me.  I want him to retire in New mexico so he can get better.  This shit he's doing by staying up here in the humidity is literallyu killing him. All I want him to do is answer phones on the ocean docked somewhere SW.  He makes me laugh and he's a true friend.  No bullshit no games.  No empty promises.  I told him he had til April to get me in a car or I was going somewhere warm.  Well that was December when I also told everyone that life as we know it won't be the same after I moved out of jimmy's.  To all those who couldn't hold out for a year and decided to be a dick in the meantime, too bad so sad.  I told everyone if david didn't come thru on the farm and Larry didn't come thru with a limo thing by April the next lease was somewhere warm.  Well Larry put up.  The car is in Illinois it's plated and insured.  We need an insurance sticker and we will be rocking.  Larry's doing that right now. Except he JUST called me as i was blogging that saying that there's a problem with the vin number... God I hope everything just works right.  For once in my life I hope it works out right!

      I don't even want to discuss pool except for this... I'm really sick and tired of how teams are stacked and no one wins but pauly joyce and bonnie even if we were 1st place all season..  They have 3 people in the "family" playing and it always seems like the last night they ALWAYS win. I'm tired of not seeing a RANDOM team line up.  I'm tired of Bonnie bouncing 8 balls out of pockets so joyce can win.  I'm tired of the games.. Really I need a break! I'm so glad it's finally over!

      I wrote carl one last letter.  Basically stating if he doesn't call me by 4:00pm on friday that I am assuming that he doesn't want to have anything to dowith me anymore and I will not bother him anymore. Along with a business deal that I don't hink he is taking me seriously on.  He really doesn't knwo me as well as he thinks.  I wrote arlyn a text message basically giving him til 4:00pm on friday to call me or I am going to assume he doesnt' want to have anything to do with me.    I got 20 pin numbers done last night while I was zoned so I have something to bring to dinner tomorrow.  Brian started working in the deli so hes on nights now.  Ryan is over all the time and i really don't care because he's on the same sleep schedule I am on it works out well.  I have to take linda to the dr and I have to be in R.L. by 8:45 if u happen to notice the post time that might give u some indication of what kind of day I've  had and I've been so completely stoned that I really don't even give a shit.  These next few days are going to be nerve wrecking.  I need all the friends I got right now.  Trying to get rid of drama is not easy.  I feel so much better now afer i wroe those emails and blogged. I'm not going to have a problem sleeping.  I posted new lyrics.  I offered to set up an email group for cathy about a summer gathering we are having up there.  Not everyone's going tobe invited this is her thing not mine. I happen to have the farm she needs.  So between working for my dad and helping out cathy with this shindig I don't have time for games.  Those are the two game players and I can't do it anymore

      Katy, i Love u darling & wanted 2 say this, even though it might be plainly obvious 2 u...  i still think things like this r good 2 hear regardless:  4 one thing u seem more grounded 2 me than u ever have been b4.  i'm talking about in the last few months, perhaps a little longer.  it seems like u're finally getting u're life straightened out & i am proud of u.  i don't give a shit what *some* people say, what u r doing is good 4 u & bad in no way shape or form.  i wish u nothing but the best - i pray u're dad can see u're serious about the ventures u wish 2 delve in2 cuz although some of u're ideas have been a little fruity i honestly believe u r on the right track now.  it's more the way u're attitude & views on everything have changed than anything else.  keep the faith, u're sense of humour (yeah like u could EVER get rid of that... u could send it express 2 egypt & it'd be knocking on u're door in the morning ;oD), & belief in u'reself & nothing but good will come 2 u.  i don't know what i would have done without u through so much shit it's unreal.  i Love u 4ever, darling.  smoochies ;oD  ps... yeah yeah...  happy new year 2 u guys 2 ;o/

      Plan of attack for all of you to see.  If anyone wants to get in my way please give it a try.  I need a little bit of drama.  Brian's gone.. an't and won't handle him anymore.  Strictly business.  Nothing more ever.  That's first plan.   Today I was at an ultimate higher understanding of life for some reason.  It's like someone slapped me with a astck upside the head and everythign came together almost poetically.  I sat down last night and wrote carl a long ass email about a business proposal to him at least in very basic terms for now.  If he bites at it he bites at it.  If he doesn't he can go fuck himself. I'm tired of playing games.  Time to put up or shut up.  I'm not even sweating anything physical I'm going thru.  All that shit it completely irrevant to anything else going on in my head.  I wrote my father a business proposal today that he will not be able to refuse.  here's that letter:  I thought this would be the easiest way to get things started.  I'll offer you something you can accept it or decline it without being put on the spot.  Typing letters like these are much easier for everyone.   My offer: I will do as much or as little number chasing as you need me to do.  As long as my rent is automatically paid to my land lady $700 a month in a check written to her directly so i dont' even see it and half my cable internet bill $30 for a total of $730 a month keep up on my car insurance and cover the cost of ink and paper you got me doing whatever it takes to help this be a sucessful venture.  I have other supplemental income to cover my other expenses.  I just need to not worry about my rent so I can focus on working for you and not worrying about it.  I think that's a VERY fair trade.  I'm just asking to be ok and I'll make sure I help take some of the weight off your plates.  Make everything easier for everyone.   Please feel free to counter offer any part of this proposal as far as I'm concerned it's a done deal.  These are my terms but always negotiable.  Feel free to alter them if you feel they don't suit everybody's needs.  If there is a tax purose to discuss I don't mind making other income to suit the govt.s needs you know what's better and easier as far as that is concerned I understand that could be an issue if you wish it to be.  otherwise we can write off the $700 as office rent the $30 as utilities and and the paper and ink off as supplies and I earn any income over that in a check with taxes or if u want to write it off as labor or what.  That's all up to you I don't really care how it gets handled.  What's easier for everyone is good enough for me.  Give it some thought and get back to me and we'll start taking care of business at hand.  Very simple!   You guys are the best and I am looking forward to making this an adventure that makes everyone some money.  I hope that you put a little faith in me and let me prove toyou what I can do.  All I'm asking for is to give me a chance.  So Anyway not only did I write this letter i sent it off.  That was the hardest thing for me to write that I have ever had to write before.  I thought the letter to Carl was tough.  That was easy compared tothis.  Carl was right I did need to do it and get the ball rolling if I want anything to change.  Well today ws the day that I changed.  I'm not sure why I did it or even what caused me to do it but I think Most of it was what Carl was saying last time eh was here.  ThenI saw him a few days later and it made all the wondering about him worht my while.  Now I know why carl is in my life.  I finally really figured it out.  Carl's here to kick me in the ass and make me prove to myself i can do it instead of making everyone else worry about it.  He's been right all along.  It finally really sunk in.  So instead of talking aout it I did something about it.    Anyway, So My main goal is opening up a garage by next summer.  This way Roger is done with all his court bullshit, and he'll be okay to get the hell out of there with takign care of any financial situations he might be in.  Gloria will get out of her situation cause god knows I can't add and i need someone for my books.  Today was the first step in getting shit done.  I had to write it all down and show my dad I was serious for once in my life.  All i need is support of people that really want to either be with me or be done.  I don't care what you care to do.  It's up to you.  The dead weight is gone.  I really have 1 goal. that's to make my kid's lives better.  They might not be mine by blood but I'll be damned if i 'm gonna allow them to be a product of an evrioment that can't be fixed when i can do something to fix it.  Sorry Glor I know u weren't ready to hear that but I love them kids more than life itself and I just can't watch it anymore.  All the men in my life better figure it out right fast what the fuck you plan on doing. well Carl you and I have a different thing going and that's private matter.  But the rest of you all better step up to the plate.  I'm going places with or without you.  Either do what it takes or get the fuck out.  I need a man or a woman for that matter that will take two minutes and read what i'm typing right here right now because it's important.  I don't need an overgrown babysitting job.  I don't need a drama factory.  I am not looking to break up any homes that don't need to be broken up.  I'm not looking for a long term i love you relationship. All I need is someone to ground me out with some really good sex.  Is that so much to ask for?  A litle bit of mutual respect.  Understand that my life will not and can not revolve around you but u are not going to hold me back either.  All i need is for you to be in my life or not I can't handle games right now.  This goes to all the men in my life that seem to think I;m really retarted and am looking for a marriage and  kids and all that stuff.  All i need is some fucking support to tell me i'm doing something right instead of telling me i'm doing them wrong all the time.  Stop breaking promises stop breaking my heart.  I don't have time for love and kids and a family life right now.  I have more important things.  If you'd all just fucking understand. You knwo who I'm talking to.  All you loose end always coming in and out of my life relationships.  Really shit or get off the pot time.  Prove to me you deserve to be a part of my life and that I would want you in it money makes me happy right now that's all i can think about.  If you want to be a part of it fine if not more for me.  Figure it out let me know.  I'm done fucking around all ready.

      Life's too short to spend it alone.  What you have always been looking for might be right in front of your face.  Money makes the world go around.  Love makes the heart still beat.  Not everyone is out to get you or get something from you.  Friends don't let friends dial/type/text message stoned or drunk.  Just when you think you're over someone something holy unbelieveable happens to make you think differently.  Breaking down walls isn't the hardest thing to do just takes patience and a good army.  Kids were put on this earth to make you feel young again.  Put your heart and head in to what you REALLY love and anything is possible.  Marijuana is a miracle drug.  Calms my nerves, helps me focus and normally cures my lower back and insomnia.  Ryan is my sense of humor.  David is my angel.  My dad is my rock.  My brother is my pride. My mom is always there for a hug.  Brian is everything I wish I could be inside.  Gloria is my voice of reason and best friend.  Allie is here to make me realize that I am not the only one that hears voices in my head.  Michelle is here so I have someone to talk to late at night among other reasons.  Arlyn is my test of patience.  Carl's here to fill some void everyone else has left behind when they left in MANY MANY ways.  Bitch Dave says all the right things at exactly the right time, he's my ego booster.  Wendy is here because someone up there knew I needed her to ground me out.  Mother Witch Catherine was here to teach me things I never thought imaginable.    My friends are all smoking REALLY good weed! muuuuuuuuuuuuuah  MSN, AOL, Norton, and most "firewalls" are viruses from hell.  I REALLY hate hardware.  Good things come to those who wait.  Better things come to those who do something about it.  A broken promise is a broken heart.  The way to my heart is a good back rub, good food, a movie or two, intelligent humor/conversation, and a phone call now and then to tell me u think about me, and AFTER you've achieved all that some REALLY good sex.  A storm is something you can not control that's what makes it so incredibly stimulating.  A short list of pet peeves: Liars, thieves, heart breakers, empty promises, procrastinators, workaholics, bible thumpers (keep it to yourself), Chevy worshipers, people that won't help themselves, people that are afraid to be themselves, people that are afraid to show ANY emotion whatsoever, people that don't just stop to see what's right in front of them.  Shit doesn't just happen you bring it upon yoruself.  If you never hear the words I'm sorry or I love you it's ok as long as they prove it to you.  Having sex, fucking and making love are 3 completely different things.  You might be doing one thing while your partner is doing something else.  The true meaning of making love when both of u are on the same page.  If you're sexuality is holding you back in life you need a new life.  Aquaintances come and go, true friends are there for life.  Even if life takes a different turn they will be there for you when you get back.  If you find yourself traveling to see someone you better make sure they are worth your time.  If you close your eyes and see thier face, or open them and wish they were right there you're in trouble.  Don't give your heart to the first girl you lay.  Assuming things makes an ass out of you.  If you want to know something just ask.  A child's laughter is the best sound in the whole world, the next best sound is absolute quiet.  It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you, it's what you leave behind you when you go.  Something's gotta give!  All I need a little bit of a break.  Life is about relationships with people.  If you don't ever understand yourself you will never understand people.  Blogging makes your mind stop racing!

      Sat outside most of the day soaking up the sun.  Trying not to stress out about being dry for 3 days straight and willie beng at acubs game.  Talked to Edder.  He's doing ok since the accident he's retired from the business.  Guess it takes something catastophic for him to mellow out.  Bitch Dave was here for a few hours.  I talked to Karen (Cathy's Daughter) she's doing pretty good.  Glor and the kids should be here sunday but will probably see her before then.  David is going ot Detroit with Roger to go pick up another car.  Him and I are going for sushi on Tuesday.  He finally got tires on the pick up.  Anyway, everything should be set for tonight I'm not promising anything but hopefully

      {{{{{{{{Katy}}}}}}}}}}   i'm alive & ok.  i've just been so fucking tired lately i haven't even been using the puter.  hell, i don't even know if i can get on messenger now... last night alan resetup his puter (the registration time expired again - go figure... u know it's almost worth $150 2 get rid of the frustration of doing this every 30 days ;oP) & when he tried 2 get back on yahoo he discovered our firewalls r so thick, heavy, & well constructed it wouldn't let him connect.  he tried msn (though why anyone would use THAT is beyond me) & got the same thing.  i know it's prolly just a configuration thing he didn't have time 2 solve... but God damn.  it's supposed 2 keep idiots out, not us from getting IN.    this made me laugh, though: 'Allie have you like gone mental?' LOL!!!  gone?!?!?  darling, i live there ;oP no seriously.  if ever i get a fucking medicaid card so i can use the damn insurance (sure - accept me 4 full coverage but neglect 2 give me the card so it doesn't make any difference anyway) i'm going straight 2 a shrink.  any shrink.  most of them r oblivious anyway so it's a damn good thing i've done so much research on this dragon that chases me.   i  know what kind of meds i need, so it doesn't really matter that most shrinks haven't a clue.  it's not that i'm suicidal again, or ragingly manic (though a little mania would be nice - perhaps something would affect me then), & certainly not psychotic (knock on wood), i'm just completely disaffected.  my senses r depressed.  nothing stimulates me.  it's like i can see the inspiration in some things but i just can't GET 2 it - if that makes any sense.  2 put it in another way - i'm intillectually depressed - which in turn is just fucking depressing the hell out of me in general.  i look at alan as he gets excited over the smallest thing & i'm fucking JEALOUS!!!  it's like i remember when i was like that - remember when i could find AND feel the inspiration in somethng as trivial as dirt or a pile of shit (or as i did once, in vomitting up my lunch) - & i just wanna crawl in a hole & die.  i'm creatively malnourished & it's slowly killing me.  something in my brain is obviously not being produced, or being over-produced & it's making me numb 2 every & anything.  it really fucking sucks ass.  so...  not only 2 be responsible (& 2 get myself 2 a point where i can function as at least half a normal person so i can take care of this child when it's born), but also 2 feel again i'm going 2 go back & get on some medication & this time i'm not gonna be stupid & stop when i'm feeling better or just plain frustrated with the whole thing.  who knows, maybe i'll find someone REALLY stupid & they won't make me go 2 therapy 2 supplement the medication.  therapy is SO FUCKING pointless 4 someone who's sole mental problems lie in chemical misfires of the brain.  i mean what r they gonna do, talk my brain in2 working right?!?!?  SHeeSH.  anyway, imma shut up now, i've gotta clean.  my cousin SAYS she's coming over, i need 2 shower & it's already 2pm.  i Love u darling & hope u're doing well.  even though i havent been on the puter much i still check in here ever few days 2 make sure u're ok.  {{{{{Katy}}}}}}

      You need back up.  She ran from me again you guys.  She even had Trina for back up.  You are such a chicken shit LOLOLOLOL.    We took 10 pts last night. I think that puts us in first. I think we only have 2 more weeks of monday.  Tonight is the last night of Tuesday pool, playing at home.  Wednesday is our last night of Wednesday night pool, playing at home.  I think I am mvp for Wednesday, and not too far off of mvp for Tuesday.  Too hot to handle this season.    Al called me at the bar last night claiming he "lost my numbers".  So I gave them to him again.  He always seems to know how to find me.    Dale and I had a really nice long heart to heart about the fact that Bonnie has an opprotunity to get that bar.  If he doesn't want to loose it to her he better get his head out of his ass, get rid of the dead weight, grow up, and do what he's supposed to do for once in his life or he's gonna loose it all.  So we'll see. He asked me if i was gonna be up there tonight.  God I hope he doesn't break up with Ana right in front of me.  I don't think I could handle that.    ANYhow, Bitch dave has resurfaced after I went over there and slapped him really hard for me and Tina.  He's got his phone back.  Maybe I'll quit bothering Roger LOLOL ya right (Beat it Beat it) LOLOL inside joke.    My house got rearranged.  The table is in the kitchen and the couch and tv in the computer area.  Works much better this way.    I guess I'm not going up to the farm this weekend after all : (.  Broken promises are getting really old really fast.  I really don't think he realizes that it's very hard for me to tell my parents no.  Oh well.  I really need an at home money weekend anyway.  David's going out to Detroit, and for once I really don't wanna go.  I just saw allie a few weeks ago and have 0 desire to see jeff ever again.  So it's rather pointless.    Bitch Dave is confiscating one night this weekend.  Me him and his son Brian are going to see Jersey Girl.  I can't believe how big his kids are getting.  I think I might actually go brat sit Gloria's kids on Sunday so she can do at least one family thing without them this year.  I might just have her bring them here tho.  They are much better behaved.  Nothing major going on tho so I'll be home most of the weekend.

Me:   Rog: see ya in an hour Me: ok  I love wake up calls like that.   Brian spent the night last night and I'm not even sweating it.   John Turley and Dani stopped by.  Seems like it's gonna be a busy ass day around here.

      I just wanted to apologize to anyone that had to deal with me this afternoon.  It was just one of those days that I wanted to crawl back in to bed and pretend it was all a bad dream.  To catch you all up... Carl is moving and i'm not really thrilled about it.  I knew it was eventually goign to happen... dave's reaction "he's probably going to move in with his other fuck"  Like I needed to hear that... What the fuck ever!  Stupid humor of the day... this is why I love my brother so much Cadman316 (11:31:52 PM): I can't believe someone got the name "SoiledCockBag".  Played Sharky's tonight. Not sure if we won or lost but I took 11 pts YAY me!   I picked up so all is well.. Tommy is a God send.  Willie decided to fuck me around so fuck him.  I'll pick up from tommy for a while... Rotating them out is always a good thing.  Brian will be taking care of things this weekend while I am up north.  You can catch him on the cell phone.  Thursday night dinner at mom's  because I can't seem to stay out of round lake no matter how hard I try.  Followed by a trip out to gloria's at least tha's the game plan.  Friday morning I will be on the gravel pit loading up trucks.  Be home about 3pm.  If you need anything just call me.  To my witchy ladies... Wishy wishy that Carl DOESN'T move.  I really really don't want to let him go just yet.

      Not a whole lot happened this weekend that's why I didn't blog.  Not because I was being lazy.  I picked up a new customer on sunday and got heat in the bird.  Was joy riding almost all weekend.  The #1 reason for moving here.. all country roads between mom's and here! YIPPIE!!!!  I love my car will love it even more with good tires on it.. hugs.........

      So I get home from Toronto and I had Brian here at like 3 am.  So after he goes to work at 6am the phone rings about noon and it's carl.  He was just "in the area".  So he stopped by.  we didn't play or anything.  I told him that I was breaking up with Brian today and he was like ya right.  Me and Brian met up with Roger over at the bird and got it sort of running.  In the meantime of him putting my car back together him and I had split up.  Not hating each other but realizing that we are just really good friends.  That's all I'm asking for right now.  If he doesn't want that then ok.  Carl calls me about 4:30...  Carl: What are ya doing? Me: Breaking up with Brian can I call you back?? Carl: Ya sure  The car runs...  The phone rings about 5:30  Carl: where are ya? Me: Garage.. Carl you're not home?? Me: um no.. Why are u right by my house?? Carl: ya about 10 minutes Me: ok I'll leae right now. Carl: ok I'll wait for ya Me: I'll be there in like a half hour. Carl: half hour?? OK.. Me: The puter is online just go check your email or something. Carl: ok  So I get home he's here in my entry way on the puter on the phone smoking a bowl.  It was really cool..  I finally got him I think. So He leaves and Brian comes over to help me find misc stuff in the house.  Yes we are still friends.  He's until about 11:30 and leaves. I go to bed.. This is the part that I love.. I wake up to carl pounding on my door.  So I've seen him 3 times in 24 hours.  I was so happy he was here.  That was some of the most incredible sex i have ever had.    His dad calls....  Carl: Hey ya old fucker what are ya doing? oh really?? Nothing just fucking around I laffed so fucking hard Carl: quite literally Laffed harder.  Got all nice and cleaned up ryan gets here..  Ryan: What's goin on Me:Nothing just fuckign around Carl: Man yo're here more than I am Me: that's saying soemthing isn't it?? Carl laffs and walks out  Tony just informend me he's moving back to denver. David Tells me we are going out to macomb on Saturday which means I get to see cherie. Brian called to tell me I can take my car out of there. David and I are going to go up and get it tonight. Marla's coming over.  I think Gloria will be coming down. Ryan's coming back over to watch UFC pay perview. I think Brian will have steven this week.

      Tama and bill are back together!  Linda called me crying this afternoon about Ashley.  How out of control she is all the time and such. Chris almost moved out of Star's last week due to Ashley drama.  This kid needs serous mental help.  I can't even stand going over to linda's anymore and dealing with her.  Linda is fearing her life from this kid.  It's so out of control over there.  Carl did call after that last post he either read it or I was thinking about him as he was thinking about me.  He tried telling me I wasn't going to see him for 2 more weeks.  I was like whatever.  I don't even really care what you do.  He didn't like the fact that Gloria was here and he didn't have my undivided attn.  He's just a boy  Brian had a day for the books with mom shit today.  Came over here cryin. I felt so bad for him he's been doing so good on getting caught up on bills and stuff.  I mean he's a moron don't get me wrong.  His mom's such a ragging bitch.  I feel bad I can't deal with him and he has to deal with her.  I just can't handle him everyday.  Gloria found a latino man at the bar she started working at but playing her cards straight she's realizing she can't deal with steve when there is so much more out there.  You go girl!  Roger is still missing whoever stole him please bring him back.

      seems my last few posts were not published.  i DID check in a few times over the past month-month & a half, though, as u'll see if u go 2 the post page.  apparently they were just saved as drafts.  i dunno if that's blogger's fault or mine.    anyway... was checking on the weather 2day & saw a banner that caught my eye.  went 2 the site & it pissed me off:  urlLink the anti-drug . ok, so i KNOW it's not a good thing 4 kids 2 be taking drugs...  but that's not the point here.  this is such a one-sided article it makes me sick.  what about the BENIFITS & GOOD THINGS about marijuana?  gee, they seem 2 have left those out.  & don't even get me started about the LSD section.  who knows what good could have come out of it if the governemnt hadn't deemed it illegal?  & u know why?  because non-government funded research of it was going so much farther than the stuff the government was finding out.  that's just the tip of the iceburg.  last month i saw this awesome documentary on it.  if only i could remember what it was called...  anyway, this site claims 'fatal accidents have occured while people were on this drug' (or something very similar) - is it just me or is this the same as saying 1/3 of car accident victims test positive 4 marijuana.  mind u - they r'nt necessarily stoned when they happen... but regardless HALF THE FUCKING POPULATION SMOKES WEED OF COURSE 1/3 OF DRIVERS IN AUTO ACCIDENTS R GONNA TEST POSITIVE 4 IT.  my point being yes, i'm sure fatal accidents have occured while people were tripping on acid but fatal accidents also occur everyday 2 people who r completely unintoxicated.  SHeeSH.  it's not a war on drugs it's a race 2 brainwash the world by only telling people what the government wants them 2 know.  FUCK it's worse than church, different religions picking out certain passages & occurances out of the bible & ignoring the rest, preaching them in ear-bleeding terminals til u take thier propaganda 4 truth while in the church next-door they've taken  different  passages fromt he same book (that could very well contradict what u're priest, pastor or reverand is saying) & r preaching  those  so-called truths 2 a different bunch of people all searching 4 something they aint gonna find from listening 2 someone else speak.    did i just have a spark of passion?  wow... maybe the anti-drug site is good 4 something afterall.  one more note on that... read this first paragraph: Usually smoked as a cigarette or joint, or in a pipe or bong, marijuana has appeared in "blunts" in recent years. These are cigars that have been emptied of tobacco and re-filled with marijuana,  sometimes in combination with another drug, such as crack . Some users also mix marijuana into foods or use it to brew tea.   i have highlighted the sentance i'm talking about in bold.  i am positive they threw that in just 2 further freak naive parents out.  really, now, i know more potheads in this world than people who don't smoke weed & NONE OF THEM smoke crack.  i do not associate with people who smoke crack.  when i meet someone someone tells me is a crack-head i can see thier teeth rotting b4 me as they speak, thier body decaying as they breathe, & have no trouble at all picturing them sucking some dealer's dog's penis 4 half a rock.  it's disgusting.  it makes me sick that they would even associate crack with marijuana.    k...  must go clean now.

      am here... & alive. just feel like so much nothing lately. it'll change though, it always does, doesn't it? stupid bitch caseworker won't send me my damn medicaid card so i haven't any proof of insurance which is about as good as having none at all. isn't that nice of her? must be awesome 2 have her job - doing jack shit 4 everyone on her caseload & getting paid 4 it.  keep trying 2 force myself 2 be more social... call this person & that but i have nothing of importance 2 say xcept how fucked in the head i feel & no one wants 2 hear that - not even me, un4tunately u can't escape u'reself no matter how far u run so i get 2 listen 2 the neverending newsreel of Allegra's Strange World 24 hours a day. lucky me.  other than that nothing has changed. money's tight cuz alan's place of employment is full of idiotic morons with no common sense who don't know how 2 efficiently run a company therefore making thier employees slave away at 70-80 hours a week 4 months on end & then all of a sudden cutting them below 40 only 2 have a plant full of jackasses wandering around 4 a month with absolutely nothing 2 do. he's going more crazy sitting in that office each day with nothing 2 do but twiddle his thumbs than when he was working himself sick with double the hours anyone should have. we'll make it though. internet is still on so everythng is cool.  i've been attempting drawing again but i can only do it in short spurts & it really sucks ass cuz half the time i cannot concentrate on reading but managed 2 get through White Oleander AGAIN last week & am working on The Bell Jar once more right now.  see why i don't post? nothing but boring muck 2 write about.  i miss u Katy & i Love u & i still pop by here at least everyother day 2 check up on u.  {{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{Katy}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}

      I feel like I just talk to everyone all the time now so I don't blog as often as usual.  Carl is moving back to San Diego a lot sooner than I had hoped.  I put him in hisplace about alot of things like him being so preoccupied on the phone that I don't even exist.  I yelled at him about not givign me a half hour's notice before he shows up ehre so I have time to make it back from Round Lake or Algonquin if I have to. Spend the night so I knoweverything's all right.  He did admit to me that I'm the only one he's fucking.  We got a lot of things squared away.  Ed.  Well he's a work of art.  He text messages so sweet then just does empty promises.  It's rather heart wrenching.  I wish he'd just stop.  I'll telli carl to fuck off if he'd just stop being so distant.  Arlyn.  Not talking to him anymore haven't since I brought Ed home.  Laura.  WE are taking things slow.  I am not going to loose her again.  Limo stuff.  FINAL meeting is Tuesday I guess.  Working with Dad.  It's going rather smoothly.  A lot smoother than I thought.  Gloria.  We had a really nice night on Friday.  The kids were really good.  She had a chance to go out have a good time and not have to worry about steve and the kids.  She was all mellow yesterday and probably today too since I haven't heard from her.  Online.  My online life is settling back down to a normal living status.  Got rid of some dead weight on that end.  Kept some good friends and just mellowed back out..   Text messaging is a wonderful thing.!

      Missing...   The warmest, nicest, kindest, most genuine, down to earth person I know.  A best friend and so much more.  She's been gone so long I don't rememeber the last conversation we had and not because i got stoned and forgot either SMARTASSES. I should have put this report out weeks ago but I figured she would just resurface.    If you run n to her...  I just want her to know that I still love her even tho life happens.  I just wished it happened closer to here.  Miss her heaps.. Oh ya and if u run in to her tell her to all her best friend every once in a while. Or just blog every now and then so we know she's alive.    Oh ya and give her a huge hug from me while u are at it.

      Brian was very sweet.  I think he is FINALLY starting toget it.  He helped me out so much today.  Made my mom lasagna for dinner.  Empty out the cat litter.  made my bed with fresh sheets and fixed the leaking aircondioner.  Mike and I gave her a car detailing at Libertyville auto spa which is on her way to work.  Brian made dinner and dessert.  I did dishes.  Candy talked about her work.  The WHOLE fucking dinner AGAIN!  So once again i didn't get to tell my mom my whole plan because she won't undersand it anyway.  Candy interrupted me twice she was talking to my dad i was talking to my mom and he was like excuse me she's talking.. I'm like ya and? I was talking to mom.  He just gave me a look I got up from the table.  Walked downstairs and took a deep breath and relaxe before i killed someone.  Oh ya now I remember why I don't live with my parents.  They drive me insane.  Then brian and I went down to Kev's then home.  Ryan and Michelle came over we sat outside on the deck and smoked a few bowls in the new bong we got. Aunt Michelle (Toby and Bruizer's Aunt) Is home! she's come home to stay!  She's not leaving no more! YAY SUSHI!!!!!!!  Ok sorry had to get that out of my system.  Kicked the boys and girls out.  Scipted my IRC stuff so I feel like a total nerd cause I still know how to do all that stuff.  I gotta email Gloria A bunch of pics I took of her and britt and brandon.  That was aweome day.  Anyhow, funny how when you get older you realize that sometimes a quiet day with your best friend and her kids puts it all in perspective.  sighssss!!!

      Well, I thought the radio situation was taken care of but apparently not.  Larry is having breakfast with Peil about adding my nextel phone to his package  .  Tuesday is THE day. Larry faxed over the PNL for the last 3 years.  The accountant is on his way down to Kansas to sit and talk corporate numbers with these assholes.  We have the Las Vegas guy as a back up cosigner if we need to.  My mother still doesn't understand how I'm going to make any money.  She won't understand it because it's not a 9 to 5 job.  She won't understnad that this is the only thing that I have a reputation in I might as well put it to use.  She does understand that I am not talking off the top of my head she just always sees things as falling apart because I touch them.   Heavy is the head that wears the crown  I'd Love to be the one to disappoint you when I don't fall down.  You don't understand what I'm attempting to explain. because you know it all and things will never change. - Limp Bizkit  I emailed Larry off the idea about getting house accounts that pay once a month on thier credit card.  So we have 2 separat days one pay day is on the 15th the other is on the 1st some will be due on one day while others are due on another.  Every 10th ride is free to house account clients.  For every house account some one brings us it's a free ride either off thier bill or for future use.  Very simple.  I think he will understnad the concept.  I hope u can teach an old dog new tricks.

      I imed Laura Wednesday we went out for lunch on Thursday followed by a 2 hour kissing session.  Ed and I finally talked.  Carl heard me out for 10 mintues before fucking the hell out of me like I have never been fucked before. OMG!!!!!  I remembered why I put up with his shit.  I got and old phone of brian's hooked up thru verizon.  If you need the new number it will be on the answering machine at home.  Larry's daughter had a hysterectomy this week.  He was trying to get out of Tmobile and they were going to charge him $275 for early termination.  The loan company meets on on Fridays so hopefully today we will figure out if we got it or not.  If we get it I will be in Kansas picking up my car.  For mother's day Mike was going to get our portraits done.  I think I am going to suggest  getting her truck detailed because that's something she won't do for herself and it needs to be done.  Then for her birthday in July I'm going to try to get HER WHOLE family portrait done.  hat will mean more to her.  I know  AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWw right...  I am going to get my dad a "dream" car for his 60th birthday, as long as I have a car I can afford it.  Went and saw Gloria last night with Brian and stopped at superb got Brian a new wooden piece and I got myself a new wooden piece and got my one I broke fixed.  I got an online girlfriend her name is Heidi.  She seems very nice and she's out in Aussie so she has that damn sexy aussie voice going.. Man I'm such a sucker for that.  Been talking to this guy Brent that lives up near Gloria on IRC.  He's a nice guy he's my day time chatter.  I got my irc friends all back.  I've been actively chatting again.  I don't know it's just very grounding.  Working my ass off for my dad so I can get himpaid off fast and start working on next month's rent.  Allie I wish you'd post.  you're worrying me for real.  You haven't been online in weeks.  As a matter of fact I don't think I've talked to you since me and david were outthere.  So u better sign onyahoo and ay hello to me before I come out there and whoop your ass.

      Well I woke up to a message from ed saying that he wasas still around and planned on calling me this afternoon.. Haven't heard from him yet but i'm wishing on my "Lucky Star" that he does call.  Followed by a call from Carl. Followed by a call from Ryan and Followed by a call from linda Followed by a call from Cathy.  she's going in for MRI regarding her ms so I hope everyone keeps her in thier prayers.  I still haven't heard from the bank if I got my loan or not and unfucker isn't answering his phone.  My house is freezing and it's fucking MAY.  I spent the late evening with Brian last night with a late night call from my new online fling in australia for like 45 minutes.  She's gonna put me in the poor house but I'm a sucker for that Aussie accent.   order of life events and just try to stop me  Limos up and running and at least one car paid off by 4th of july. Garage by 4th of July Gloria moved out by the time school starts. The theater by the school start of next year so by next like August. The stretch paid off by that christmas or whatever vehicle I will be in.  Trade all that shit in for a new stretch and a new navigator Send Larry down to vegas for retirement Take over the biz. Fire Ralphie if he doesn't let me do it before hand. THEN maybe think about fiding me a life mate. Not before not after.  :I wanna get set up in life..  Look out that rising virgo is doing just that.  Oh ya and I'm supposed to hear from Todd today :) happy dance time

      No limo yet I bought a parts car for $200 for my t bird!!! Yippe!!!!!!! Allison and Jim are in Jail down in Florida both had possession charges.  Her Brother Jake is helping her out but we all decided it's best to leave Jim there.  Jake said Allison should be out by monday. I'm down to 160 lbs!!!!!!!!!!! 10 lbs to go! ummmmmmmmmm Not much else really going on.  Carl's been a complete dick.  I hope one o these days he'll sit back and realize what he had going on here and remember what it was like and dream about what it could be like.  but if that doesn't happen and he just fades that's ok too.  i'm so hurt by the way he talks to me i can't stand it. So instead of getting al depressed about it I'm just gonna put my head back in to money so i don't think about him.  oh I have this awesome idea for ebay! I want to first sell off the parts of my tbird. THEN...........  I'm going to start a drive away company on ebay list it as a service.Starting bid of $500 I will drive your car from chicago land area anywhere in the US. 5 day guarantee delivery.  THEN if that takes off up the starting bid to $800 and include canada.  Now I fly back hop flights on teh way back and recieve a free airline voucher.  So lets say i win a car on ebay I can fly down for free and pick it up.  Drive it back.  Put it back up on ebay after a $200 maccoo paint job and resell it with DELIVERY avail.  No one on ebay sells cars with delivery avail.  So anyway that's teh game plan.  Gotta wait til monday to call a few drive away companies and see what they charge the customer.  If i sell it as a SERVICE on ebay i think it will REALLY take off.  Doesn't hurt to try!  I am adding a team blog for my mp3 groupies.  I'm hopin to have a little fun with it.

      i think i just got a comcast rep fired.  GOOD.    in other news: Harry Potter & the prisoner of Azkaban comes out 2morrow.  which means i have 30 hours & 57 minutes b4 i get 2 see it.  went & got advance tickets yesterday, which was a good thing considering there were only 3 showings left 4 friday that werent sold out.   my dad got a new car.  & i don't mean just  another  car, no... he actually bought a  NEW  car.  a candy-apple red 2004 focus.  he then has the nerve 2 ask me: r u sure u like it cuz u're gonna end up with it one day.  why do people talk like this?  it's not cool.  anyway, it just so happens that i think the car is OK.  i hit my head everytime i get in it (which makes me wonder who engineered the thing & 4 whom?  midgets?  i'm only 5'2" 4 fucks sake.)  but other than that it's cool.  got a cd/mp3 player, power everything, heated seats (what WILL they think of next?), & self de-icing side mirrors.  i'm happy 4 him.  bought time he got himself a new car.  it was rather rediculous, u know?  65 years old, worked at ford 4 35 years & not once ever had a new car.    on sunday Alan & i went over 2 my cousin Donna's house (which is only 2 1/2 miles down the road i found out) 4 a 'family' bbq.  i hate those family functions & alan was extremely nervous about it.  i can't say i blame him.  i didn't really know myself how it was gonna go - him metting them (& vice-versa) 4 the first time.  i mean, i knew they weren't gonna like be really rude or anything... but it turned out pretty damn good, alot better than i expected (not that i knew what 2 expect int he first place).  my aunt anna & donna wanna give me a baby shower, typical women they r all ga-ga over a new baby.    ---ummnn... what did i just do?!?!  my explorer just went full screen & i can't get it back!! ----  & my aunt informed my dad that he'd be buying us the crib & other furniture - LOL.  so anyway...  i'm glad all THAT (the family meeting & shit) is out of the way.  it's relieving.    my mind is drifting, concentration going away so i'll end here 4 now but will try 2 give a report on how absotively posolutely amazing Harry Potter was, prolly on saturday cuz i know EVERYONE will wanna know.  ;oD

      Steve is out of town til like Tuesday so is Jeremy. Evil's hanging around tho and it's all gewd... Steve and I had a really long talk on Friday and i think him and I are going to be just fine. Every once in a while you have to take a step back and realize what gewd stuff you have around you instead of the bad all the time.  Jeremy: You've been a GEWD friend! Been my rock when I needed it and my voice of reason through it all. For that alone I thank God you're in my life  Michel: Thank you for everything. Thank you for just being you and not listening to everyone else. Thank you for having a mind of your own and speaking it even when it's not easy. I know when you're around I'm at ease, unless yer kik bannin ppl LOLOL.... Anyway, thanks for filtering out the bullshit and realing that online drama doesn't mean much of anything. We're still friends no mater what happens online and THAT's what's important. Just thanks for being you.  Steve: I don't even know where to start... I guess i should first start off by thanking you for coming back in my life. It seems we find each other when we need each other the most. That's all that's really important. I have one of the coolest friends one could hope for. I feel safe when you're here and lonely when you're not. I missed you in my life very much and I'm glad I'm a part of your life again. By the way I found logs you told me you were 21 when we first started talking and that's like WAY NOT you were more like 19 :P FYI... Do the math... ANYWAY.... Thanks for trusting me like you do. Means alot!

      I got the power point set up for a meeting with Charlie, just about.  I gotta fine tune it and check for overall stuff.  The noise in my head is pretty quiet now that I got pics taken of the property and got MOST of the things I wanted in the PP done.  Next step is calling Charlie Monday morning and emailing him this PP hashing it over and gettign him to put it on his lap top and bring THAT to the meeting with Bam Peterson and Jim McGee.

      i'm glad 2 hear u're still alive & kicking, dear.&nbsp; was worried cuz u were gone 4 so long, i may be prone 2 fits of dissapearing but u not visible online is almost an excuse 4 a worldwide manhunt ;oD.&nbsp;i believe i've told u b4 i think the garage idea is one of u're best yet, but i've said it again anyway cuz u asked 4 feedback.&nbsp;   i know i've been missing 4 awhile...&nbsp; no energy 2 fight 2 get out of myself i guess.&nbsp;   everything is pretty OK here. alan & i r doing very well 2gether.&nbsp; i, on the other hand, am not doing so well with myself unless u wanna count the astounding talent i have at hiding that fact.&nbsp; i'm doing very well with that indeed.&nbsp;   i miss u, Katy & hopefully i'll be able 2 force myself out of myself after i pop this kid out ;oP.&nbsp; just a month 2 go.&nbsp; amazed at the incredibly wierd thing growing a child does 2 a body.&nbsp;   anyway...&nbsp; just reposting my journal entry from deviantart 2day as it's been so damn long since i posted anything anywhere:  hopping, skipping, jumping, walking, breathing regularly... my head has seemed 2 take these on 4 me (with the exception of breathing NORMALLY) as my body cannot, at the moment do them physically.&nbsp; i have 2 wonder & worry about how much worse it's gonna be in a month after i have the baby.&nbsp; i'm sure some of this is normal, all the worrying, crying, euphoria, plunging fear, ecstatic bursts, helplessness, everything-is-beautiful, etc., etc. but it's just way 2 much like going insane & 4give me if i can't shake THAT feeling, no matter how quickly the others take hold of me entirely &amp; then pass.&nbsp;&nbsp;   somedays i wake up & actually think that maybe i can get something productive done through all the mental/emotional clutter/anxiety that's floating me through this, but the really exciting thing is that sometimes i can actually FEEL inspiration 2 get something productive done.&nbsp;  it's been more than 3 months since i picked up a pen, pencil, crayon & created anything visually.&nbsp; this is the most i've typed/written since my last journal entry in here.&nbsp; hell, i think it's the most words materializing out of my head in a 24 hour period since then.&nbsp; sometimes i just can't talk.&nbsp; locked inside myself or something.&nbsp; alan will say something 2 me & i'll just look at him in fear that i've gone mute cuz nothing will come out of my mouth.&nbsp; he actually bitched at me about it a few weeks ago, that he was tired of talking 2 me & me not responding.&nbsp; all i could say was i was sorry... how 2 explain this 2 someone?&nbsp; i just laid down on the couch (after attempting 4 a 1/2 hour 2 put it out of my head), covered my head & cried.&nbsp; i didn't even have the words in me 2 attempt 2 explain.&nbsp; it sounds pathetic & like an excuse.&nbsp; but sometimes i think someone's stuck a cork in my mouth, or ripped out my vocal cords or short-circuted my brain cuz half the time when someone says something 2 me i just go blank.&nbsp;   & we won't even get in2 the anxiety &amp; joy over the baby.it may seem like i'm thinking this was a bad idea but really honestly underneath it all i've never felt so blessed in my entire existance.

      It's safe to say   that my love for you has changed   but it's getting stronger every day   and there's not a thing I would have changed     I'm completely completed   and grounded back out   my gewd energy isn't depleted   I'm glad I ground you out     God put you back in my life for a reason   and I'm not one to judge.   it's love without rhyme or reason   and no reason to hold a grudge     My heart grew fonder   as time moved on   now all I ponder   how far will WE move on.     I've never trusted someone like I trust you   and that eases my heart and soul   that you let me do what I gotta do   and let me just rock n roll :P     I promise you won't regret   coming back home and finding me   you were the one person I didn't want to forget   Thank God he let you find me     Steve you are the best thing that's happened to me in a very very long time... I promise you won't regret coming home!  Welcome home and thank you for being a true friend.  Roots run deep and family runs deeper.

      ok so now on to the garage fing... From the begining this time...    I have a lot of people I have offered a lot of things to.. that stuff isn't THAT important to most so I'm just gonna tell ya what I got accomplished this week...  I think I JUST figured out how to get everyone out of the middle of all this.... OMG some fucking days... I swear to god...    See what happens when you write out ideas??? they come alive right in front of you.. God bless blogger!  ANYWAY.....    SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.............. The garage... I've been tawkin about it fer a year and have it in my head everythign i wanna do wif it... but i gotta blog it n get feedback...    Location: Valentin & Long Lake Rd. Round Lake, IL.  This property is right across teh street and down the hill from cencom.  Cencom is central communications dispatch fer 4 villages.. Round Lake, Round Lake Park, Round Lake Beach, Round Lake Heights.  1 building 4 departments.  I am offering storage of the impounded vehicles for all 4 town in to one lot.  right now it's currently being divided by 2 different garages.  I will take the storage because of location!  They can walk out the front door and see the impound lot from the driveway. They would be lewking DOWN in to thier impound lot from thier parking lot..  so now if u wanna pay fer your impound fee oh ya I take credit cads n pay pal fer payment.. THAT'S Thinking outside the box.... ANYWAY....  Fenced in 2 acres of propoerty.    Facility:  Blacktop fer the front acre, gravel fer the back acre storage.  1 8 bay building with an office.  on a concrete slab.  8 bays 2-3 mechanic ran. 1 paint bay. 4 extra bays rent out by the hour u come work on your own vehicles.  This way the other mechanic shops around town can rent out the bay per day n get caught up everyone is like 3 weeks behind.  I don't need the mechanic shop to make money it's pure profit I will make my payments off storage fees....    KISS! Keep it simple stupid... with a mechanic it's $60 an hour wifout a mechanic it's $30 u come work on your own cars.  now that it's fenced in I can do repossessions.  Storage for the villages and a mechanic shop all on 2 acres cause it's zoned industrial and commercial TADA....  So every hour the bay is booksed it's $30 to the shop... no matter what.. the mechanic gets $30 an hour the shop makes $30 an hour... rent it out by the hour $30... storage fer city impounds and repossessions... lots going on but all managable... MONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY    that's it in a nutshell... I got all my verbals i needed thur the village... a verbal ok from da bank... ready to rock n roll jsut gotta make sure i'm gonna get the villages biz if i do this...  that's inthebag the Chief of police owes me a FEW we'll just say that!!!

      what if no one is willing ot help me out? I mean no one has to do anything fer me yanno... Still gotta cover my ass... SO I came up wif an idea that i know cathy will be ok wif... cause I allready talked to her...   but this is my last rant about money...    Ok so you're tapped on cash but has a bunch of fuckin plastic... you want weed but just can't afford it.... OK so u withdrawl from your credit card $1500 to get yer ass caught up... deposit it in your pay pal acct... deposit it in to your bank acct now u have fast cash... now u still have to pay that credit card payment, but u only have to make MINIMUM payments fer the loan... now u set up wif your credit card company to automatically withdrawl your monthly fee from your checking acct... now that's it's all automatic... so u get GEWD credit... ALSO u get the cash you need off yer own credit instead of someone elses...    Pay pal rocks... You can store as many credit cards on file as u need.. This makes it easy.. Hey glor u want weed? Ya take it off my credit card would ya???  SURE no problem.. I withdrawl $ off your credit card that's stored on my pay pal acct.  It gets deposited RIGHT in to my bank.  24 hours later i got money u got weed.. DONE fuckin deal!  now u are borrowing money from your credit card making regular payments on it so u get good credit.  now u have this cash just sitting in your bank or u can use it to pay bills n stuff... just make sure your montly fee fer your credit card is in there....  SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoo.. no money fer weed but want some I got paypal!  WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT  take it off yer credit card..... WOOOOOOOOOOOOOT  that i have on file so u don't have to keep giving me the number over n over again.... WOOOOOOOOT...

Callin matt fer oz prices if i can sell 4 1/2 gram commercial joinst fer $20 I can sell 2 dank joints fer $20. 4 bowl packs of dank $20 er 2 joints fir $20. Debeaned destemmed... Only one fuckin glitch... How do i come up wif $300 fer an oz of widow?? Danny can I borrow $300...

      Ok so I'm sitting here trying to figure out this puzzle in my head on how to get liquid fast. I was also figuring out how to get me and OZ of shake fer basically free. Pay my rent and $275 to ameritech that's gonna bounce. HOW the fuck am I supposed ot do all that in a few days?    So I had a pothead epiphany... Much different from a bthroom ephinay which requires 2 heads to fink about at one time.. pothead logic is just that... weed n creativity....    So to start things off I needed an OZ of SHAKE fer free... DING.. Enter Tommy....   SO I gotta figure out how to weasle an OZ of shake from tommy fer freee...  SO what I figured was if we got an OZ of shake fer free me and brian can roll it up in to joints...  Debeaned Destemmed 1/2 gram joints 4 per $20, 3 different flavors and a wired randy. If we don't have to destem it because it's shake... it's not hard.. me and brian can whip out 3 joints a piece in abotu 5 mintues. so it will take us 5 minutes for 6 joints 10 minutes fer a dozen.. n so on. It won't take very long to zip out an ounce of joints as long as it's mostly destemmed. Debeaned Destemmed 1/2 gram joints 4 per $20.. If I don't PAY fer the weed cause i'm giving tommy a back rub... the number are ummmmmmmmmmm ALLLLLLLL profit... I can sell that off in one night up at 94 wif all that biz.. DONE     Now i just made... 28 grams in to 1/2 gram joints make 48 half gram joints... sell them at 4 joints fer $20. The beauty is... you have 4 1/2 grams debeaned destemmed bowl packed ready or joint ready. if it's FREE is 28 grams divided by 4 cause theres 4 joints to a bag.. That makes 7 bags fer $20 a piece - $140 profit in 3 days.

      Just once I'd love to hear I miss you But you never say it so to speak Your actions speak louder than words Yet some people call you weak  Just once I'd love to hear I'm sorry But that will never be because words are only words and you'd rather just show me  I find myself with you on my mind no matter what else I try You're the only one that can make me Laugh on days I just want to cry  No matter how bad we fight and sometimes we say things we regret I know tomorrow you'll forgive just maybe not forget  I miss you when you aren't around but I know you think of me too that's all I've ever asked for that's what keeps me here with you.

Taking care of them but making sure she goes up on my bed to get away.  She had em in the closet like we thought she would.  CLeared out all th clothes from the floor and sh had them in the hallway there under my clothes.  She's so cute.  She was so worried about the last baby all day she was trying to kill it off by not feeding it.  It was so sad.  But it did die over night so she wasnt' worried about it all day today. She's a whole different cat then she was 2 days ago.  It's so cool.  Any spare time she gets she's in my lap.  Um memory check she's never been on my lap!  I need STEMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Stem call!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Who's got em?????????????? Fork em over!  I've been so busy I just haven't had time to blog so here it goes... I've come to a few realizations this week since I've had plenty of time to pound on metal and fix my bird.  I've realized that online people can be some of the best people in the world.  This week was lets figure out who your friends are... SO the list..  *^Tick & Evil you guys are the best people.  I promise I will make all the trouble and it will be worth it in the end.  I know I can trust you guys with everything I have.  I don't even know if I have real life friends, but a select few, that are as trustworthy as you two.  All I gotta say is you guys blew me away this week. Thank you for having an open mind and heart.  I know we will make a great IRC family.. Blood is thicker than water!  Family should ALWAYS stick together even when we have a day.  My online family is VERY important to me.  I promise to make a safe haven for them if they a want a place to get away and have people around them that GENUINELY like them.  We might fuck with each other all day long but in the end we are family, I think.  Thick and Thin we've learned to forgive.  Thank you for just being you.  and incest is best LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL i'm kidding inside joke! *SupraJerm Jeremy I wouldn't have done my safe have without you thank you so much for being there for me. *Summer Kim I don't even know what to say but thank you for being so understanding I hope you come join my online family.  They like you too!  Congrats on getting your visitors to leave! *#Marijuana you guys are fucking awesome! I don't even know how to thank you.  The world needs more potheads!  *For those of you that weren't indivdually mentioned but have the link for a few reasons: I like you you can stay! You help me when I need it without question and for that I can never forget thank you!  My best friend in the whole world still rocks so hard she rolls.  Oh ya i finally got around to renaming all them pics from mother's day.  As soon as they are fixed i'll email em to ya.  My phone calls JUST today you guys think i'm kidding all the time. Allison Dan Brian Dan Charles Allison's hubby from jail thatI didn't accept the call from Called Old dude about the Cadilac (And got it!)    *Got a tow truck driver on speed dial! Mom Called Allison back about Jim  I got up at 11 played some poker and it's only 4pm now getting ready for a 4:20  I got my super charger up on ebay  urlLink Super Charger    *The driveaway thing didn't work but I'm working on verbage so it should hit next time.  Oh ya about that cadilac thing.  Since I had to go out to clevland and pick up a parts car for my cars I'm parting out cars now.  Selling the extras on ebay.  Larry just wants the cadilac out of the driveway and i knwo he will sell it to me cheap.  I have to use either danny's garage or david's garage to part tiout.  we'll see hat happens Danny's not working right now so he needs the money.  I didn't get to go to that concert but neither did gloria cause Roger blew her off.. Huh Magine that! TOLD ya  I haven't talked to Allie in weeks!  I'm posting Pics on my prideintheheart geocities page.  About had enough of not having that available.  The only reason why I haven't done it yet is because I had to organize the pics in my computer before I downloaded any others off the cam.  Bri's mom gave him this really nice digicam.  Think I might play with it today.  Danny is on his way over with Taco Bell.  Danny used to live across the street from Brian's mom and dad.  He basically moved cause Larry (Bri's Dad) drove him crazy.  How hilarious is that?  I gave david back the truck last week.  So I have been without a vehicle for a few days.  It's really ok tho I needed to just stay home.   Love you guys!

      If I don't stop and see the gewd i swallow myself in the bad.  Carl messaged me today about 12:30.  I haven't been able to get him out of my head but that means he can't get me out of his.  I've really been trying to be a tough girl with him.  I put it on the line today..  I told him that 1 phone call eevery 2 -3 weeks doesn't cut it.  he was like were good friends katy that's all i can offfer you... as if i was askin for more than that or something.   God fucking virgos.  Why can't you all ever just admit you miss me?  Is that a whole lot to ask? more than 10 minutes out of 3 weeks is a lot to ask for or something?  WTFE!  he really hurt me so bad today.. BUT then on the other hand I know he was thinking about me all day cause we talked while he was at werk on IM fer like half hour.. That like never happens..  He is jsut always wanting to add more people to us like couple play which all of you know i'm not against.  I just don't want to sahre my time.  I get so little of it.. I don't think it's right for him to be asking me for that when I never see him anymore.  I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO sexually frustrated that I've shut off the whole idea all together.   If it's not one person ignoring me it's another.   I just don't have time to be ignored.  I don't have the heart for it anymore..  SO my newest moto... imported today.. I won't be ignored.  I'm not chasin anyone... if they want to talk to me they will find me.  Nothing's changing but the fact that I don't have time to be online or in any one place for very long.  I haven't even been to the bar in 3 weeks... Between trying to build myself a website for the garage.  Power point presentations, zoning and planning meetings, I don't have time.  All I have time for is to blog and talk to the ones that wanna talk to me.... The second I get ignored I'm on my blogger so i'm only thinking about one thing at a time.  As I clear my head about something I can go back to what I was doing.  So If you ever need to know what's up.. just read.. it's easier..  I try to not be negative on here this is my happy place.. it's the only one i can control and create.  Right now I have no control over anything.  My fate lies in the hands of corporate america and village politics.   The one I TRUELY LOVE with all my heart is in California not sure what side is up.  Won't just give me time so he can get to know the real me and no this person he's gotten to know over the last year that has been so unpredictable i don't even know whats going on.  Important people in my life have come and gone.  The ones that are here now are here for a reason.  I've been trying to explain that certain people in my life so you all get a betta idea of why I am the way I am...  It's not WHAT you knwo it's WHO you know.  I know some wonderful people... They have been here for me thick and thin... These are the people that make the rest of it worth living.  Aris:  I'm so happy yer back.. nothing is the same without you Johnny:  thanks for being a man :) and congrats on yer woman :) Jeremy: you've been like glue fer me.  thanks formaking me take my own advice. Steve:  Just even sure what to say.. I think I've said it all... you're the best! Danny:  Everything happens for a reason.  God put you in my life and you've been my savior.. Thanks for EVERYTHING even putting up wif Brian Bongy: Welcome back bro missed ya heaps Trisha:  It's nice to have ya back around.. We'll get yer chan going old skewl style.. I got yer back sistah Michel: thanks fer being my sense of humor.. yer a lil rough around the edges but i wubs ya anyway. PG: all I can say gf is you rock so hard you roll!  we're too much alike LOLOL  Glor:  By spring GF I promise ya! you know me I don't break my promises Carl: I know you read this thing... You tell me I got a lot of growing up to do.. Trust me I know that, but so do you. Allie:  I miss you so much I wish you'd come see me before you pop.. I promise I'll come out after you have yer baby.  I think abotu you all the time and pray for you every chance I get.  All them feelings are really natural.. just ride it out honey you'll be a gewd momma u got the sense of humor fer it. Midget: You are the best brother in the WHOLE world.. Yer so smart, funny, genuine, and down to earth.  You mean more to me than anything in this whole world.  I'm so proud of how well you are doing... I'll miss you when you go back to skewl... IRC will be fun this year :)  how can it not be??? I have the bestest friends ever!
