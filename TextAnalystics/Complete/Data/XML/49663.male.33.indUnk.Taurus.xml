       Well, Pop Goddess BRITNEY SPEARS is in town tonight...shaking her illicit and tampered rack around the stage. is she just a giant hootchie, or is there some redeeming quality that I am missing completely? A friend of mine called yesterday...YESTERDAY, people....wanting tix to Miss Brit's SOLD-OUT show. Nothing like waiting til the very last minute. "Oh, I'll just call Todd and get tix thru him." Well, the last time I checked, my name wasn't Ticketmaster...and if it was, I'd be pissed about not getting any of those "convenience" fees. Granted, I am a miricle worker when it comes to scoring tix. I have connections all over the place...and probably (if I really wanted to) I could get her the tix. But, right now, I am feeling a little cranky. So, excuse me.

       They keep trying to trick us into volunteering our time. Okay, let me back up...my work is having a big community open house on Sunday, September 10. We expect about 12, 000. This is our third year doing it. Everyone is expected to participate in some way...even though it's volunteer. So, whatever...the Committee (think: high school cheerleaders or Pep Squad idiots) keeps sending emails to the entire staff...reminding us daily of the event. Now, imagine....you're walking into work one day and you see post-it notes EVERYWHERE. Hundreds upon hundreds of post-it notes all over the offices and entire office building - each with quasi-cute remarks about the event. Somebody has a little too much time on their hands. ANyway, all of this "Pep Rally" mentality is taking it's toll. People are getting turned off very quickly. So, it must be true that everyone hates cheerleaders. No one wants to be caught dead following the cheerleader parade. Strange, but true.

       Oh, I almost forgot. There's been a water main break here in downtown! YAY! Thousands of gallons of water erupting every second from the middle of the street. They have already evacuated the hotel across the street, and thousands of office workers are trapped in their buildings.

       Ahhh, the end of summer in the city. All of the kids are back in school, and there seems to be a new sense of routine and orderliness.  It's like everything received a fresh coat of paint, and that "new car smell" still lingers. I look at school buses and laugh - I remember feeling stuck, like I'd never get out of there. Forever indentured to the Kenston Local Schools. The greatest day, perhaps, was the moment after my high school graduation, when all strings were officially severed. No one could hold anything over me anymore - especially delicious was the fact that no one ever caught me when I forged a report card in 7th grade. To this day, my forged grades stand on my record. I never told anyone about it until I had my degree from the University. THEN I told my parents (who thought the whole thing was a riot). Anyway, I kind of like that orderliness has returned to my rambunctious neighborhood. Things quiet down now around 9 or 10 in the evening, as opposed to 2 or 3. Plus, I like that first beautiful week when everyone has clean, new shoes.

       Devoted 3 hours in the early part of the day to the mundane, the routine...the office. As if I had no other plans later in the day, I arrived at work to tidy up some of those obnoxious "loose ends."  They are not really loose ends, of course, but the stupid details one deals with daily. They become "loose" when one goes on an extended visit elsewhere. In this particular case, New York.  Weather in Cleveland: sunny, mid-seventies, humid....delightful flying weather, right?!   My cab driver spoke of "slapping his bitch", smoking weed and being his own boss. Maybe in his late 40's. I did manage to arrive on schedule and intact. I guess this is most important of all. Steve managed to miss his flight - or should I say, our flight. I had specifically rearranged my flight schedule to fly with him on his first business trip for the company. However, sitting at the airport, I realized that I would be traveling to NYC alone, as we boarded the plane with no Steve in sight. The most irritating part of all of this is the fact that our plane sat on the tarmac for almost two hours while we waited for weather clearance from LaGuardia. Eventually, we were off. I got to New York without a hitch, checked-in at the hotel and took a stroll thru Manhattan. The conference will start in the morning. Must be on BEST behavior. Note to self: do not bitch-slap Laura M.

       It's the dregs. After a full day of sweatshop labor, I have yet another meeting to go to...one that will surely induce lethargy or nausea. I have no hope of emerging from this quorum with any feeling in my limbs. Basically, we're dealing with a mountain of legal mumbo-jumbo and hocus-pocus. I can't stand the stuff, but I guess it helps the world go 'round. Still no activity on both the Dr. Tom and mystery David fronts. However, Other David is doing a little recon work for me. Hopefully, it will return some sort of result. In other news, my dear friend Trish is still in Mexico, skanking it up with some hottie, no doubt. Either that, or completely polluted and baking on the beach. Here's to you, Trish!  I IMed my friend Jennie in the UK today. You all should really get to know her. She likes tomatoes and black-capped Chickadees.

       THE TAO OF STEVE was quite an engaging, entertaining film! For those who may not know, it is a comedy about applying Taoist principles to dating/hooking-up...and the ensuing chaos it causes. I loved it! At one point it mentions that Love is the national religion of the USA...pretty accurate, don't you think? Love is the opiate of the masses. Or maybe, it's just the pursuit of Love that's the opiate.

       Antique hunting yesterday was a flop. Well, let me clarify: I was not hunting for antiques. I was hunting for  mystery David, actually, his friend Marc. However, Marc was not at his antique shop...as he was attending some big antique show somewhere down the pike. So, I got absolutely no new scoop on my mystery man. I'm starting to forget what he looks like...it's getting fuzzy. Then, as you know, I attended a little block party last evening. It was a fairly delightful party...especially when Dr. Tom arrived. As usual, he gave me a hard time - I think it's his hobby now. We sat together at dinner - amazing since my friend Larry was executing a cock-block (chatting/flirting with Tom). So, I was less than pleased with that...but then I decided I just don't give a fuck anymore. Whatever happens happens, right? Who needs to dedicate that kind of energy worrying about it?  I did drag my ass to church this morning. I am UCC...which is open and affirming of the Lesbian/Gay/Bi/Trans communities. And, in normal fashion, ended up flirting with this really cute guy - who ended up being a Presbyterian minister. I should say RECOVERING Presbyterian minister. He's a chaplain at a hospital now. He's incentive enough to keep going...outside of the fact, of course, that I have many friends who attend regularly.  I am going to go see the film THE TAO OF STEVE later this afternoon. Three filmmakers from my hometown made the flick. I can't wait to see it.  I'll be sure to report in later.

       Today started, really, at 12:30 AM when I called his voicemail at the hotel. I had to leave a message saying goodbye and saying how sorry I was to miss him, but I had to get some sleep. After I had finished, I put the receiver in the cradle and drifted back to sleep. At 1:20 AM I woke to the electronic chirp of the telephone. His voice filled my head.    	Are you already in bed? he asked. Of course I was, who wouldn't be in bed at 1:20 in the morning? I remember some droning and frequent pauses. Neither of us knew quite what to say. And, as if we were following some hastily written script, we said goodbye, blandly.    	When I woke for good at 7:45, I readlied for work. Not many of my thoughts lingered about him. What I thought about mostly, was the regularity, the blissful predictability of my morning ritual and the routine of my work day. I had no sadness to fear...I could have said a thousand goodbyes and not cared because I knew that at 9:00 I would be on the phone, in my chair at the desk in my office, conducting business. But most of all, I would be safe from matters of the heart.    	Once, when the pace slowed, I decided to call him at the hotel. A final act of chivalry, I suppose. I remember my heart palpitating as I punched the numbers in on my telephone.    	Where may I direct your call?  the hotel operator asked crisply.    	Room 1322, please.    	And, there he was. The bass in his voice intensified by sleep.    	I just wanted to say goodbye one more time, I said.    	Oh...goodbye.

       I have a lot of ties. But my favorite one. My favorite tie is owned by the evil and nefarious overlord known as Melvin. The tie itself is spectacular: a deep grapey purple with flecks of blue and green. It is quite spectacular, but he won't let me have it. He (Melvin) does not wear ties. He refuses to. He wears nothing but argyle sweaters and oddly colored trousers that mostly don't match. The tie of my dreams hangs in his walk-in, next to 200 other ties he doesn't wear.  Just think of the rapture, the joy...the unmitigated happiness of my life if I owned this brilliant tie. I think I may just have to snatch it from him, although he'd know it was me, immediately because 1. He knows I worship the tie, and 2.  I might have access to it. So, until I decide what I'm doing about the world's best tie, I am not going to wear any of mine. I'll leave them in a jumble on the floor of my closet. No tie-straightening until I get Melvin's prized tie.

       Cheap thrills and porch hootch. Watching the world go by on Bridge Avenue in the late summer afternoon. Just last week, we saw the fire department take a wrong turn on the way to a fire. They circled back and, evidently, found their target: a warehouse billowing black smoke a few blocks away. Kim and I are going to sit on the porch today: drinking beer and discussing cute guys. We're hoping some of those hottie firemen might stop by - hey, I have matches...I know how to use them. With my luck, I'd get the ugly Troll division. Any fun plans for the weekend? I have a friend's birthday dinner to attend to this evening. Tomorrow, we're having some sort of block party with all of the neighbors on the street. I think Dr. Tom might be there. Today is Jennie's birthday, so I want to say Happy Birthday and hello to my best friend in the UK.

       I was trying to find someone - anyone - who knows anything at all about dream analysis. What would the Space Shuttle symbolize? What about that aircraft carrier in the middle of the small lake? ANyway...I'm still waiting on the analysis portion of the dream. I'll share all the details just as soon as they're avail. I leave for Boston tomorrow. I hope that BLAST! show is entertaining. I have to go and check it out for work. Not bad, eh? I wonder if my flirty superpowers will work in that area code? Last night, I went to see the Tammy Faye documentary at our local art theatre. Wow! What a scream! RUN, don't walk! Go see this flick! It's narrated by RuPaul...yet another cool feature. Trust me, it's worth whatever they're charging.  (more later, I think)

       Last night I dreamt of space shuttles and old college friends and gliding over the terrain waving at people - people on a military base that kind of looked resort-ish and a little golf course-y. We launched into the sky and then glided around waving at military personnel until we landed safely on an aircraft carrier sitting in the middle of a small lake.   urlLink

       I just don't get it. This whole month so far, I've been meeting people. When it rains, it pours. It started out with Jim, who I met on a Sunday a few weeks ago. There was this wonderful energy, VIBE, you know...the "click" that happens when you really dig someone and they dig you back. The vibe was totally kickin' between the two of us. Well, he travels a lot and so I didn't hold out a TON of hope...but enough to make myself frustrated. He was ALL shades of flirty with me...trust me...you want details? Email me. So, I give him my business card...it was discreet, but had all the pertinent info on it: the digits and the email. Have I heard from him? No. Do I still think that I will? Yes. My psychic friend says so.   Okay, so skip ahead a couple of days...that's when we pick up yesterday's ROCKY HORROR story. Ugh! No call from mystery David, and not a peep from cutie Dr. Tom across the street. What's a guy to do? I keep meeting all these great guys who clearly have SOME sort of interest and then NOTHING!!!  AAARRRRGGGGHHH! I guess there's nothing more to do but wait. Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait.  Any suggestions people?

       Alright...so I missed a day...what's the BIG deal?!  I spend the whole of yesterday afternoon and evening on my front porch with friends drinking Rolling Rock and telling stories. Kim, Kelly and I had caught a wonderful buzz by 5:30 when our across-the-street neighbor popped over. Dr. Tom is a professor of Psychology...so he's ALWAYS a blast. We all hung out until 9 or so, when we needed to forage for food. Well,  wouldn't you know? There was a vibe KICKIN between me and Dr. Tom! Who woulda thunk it?! He's absolutely adorable AND charming AND handsome. I never thought to look across the street. I probably have been remiss in not telling you my other adventures recently. Last week, I went to see my friend Kim in a production of THE ROCKY HORROR SHOW. She played the Usherette that gets to sing "Science Fiction Double Feature." She was incredible!! The show was a knockout! Very professional! Anyhow, during the first act, I am seated down in the third row (I went by myself) and next to me is this guy who looks like Truman Capote....hat and all!  So, after intermission, I return to my  seat, and this  total hottie has taken the seat next to me. He is talking to Truman and doesn't look like he's gonna move. We chit-chat...we make eyes...we giggle and smile. He was delightful. At the end of the show, he introduces himself as David and queries whether I might be going out after the show. I tell him I am meeting my friends in the cast. Of course, I am fresh outta business cards or any shard of anything with contact info on it...frustrating!!! His friend Marc meanders over and invites me out with them, and tells David to give me his number so I can call him and find out where they're going. David turns bright red. Marc walks away. They decide that they're NOT going out after all. So, David tells me he has to take his friends home, because he drove them. I tell him how wonderful it was meeting him. He says he'll get in touch with me thru a mutual acquaintance...I tell him that won't work because said person doesn't know my last name. I tell him I am the only Todd Stuart in the book...but he has to look it up onder S-T-U-A-R-T, or he'll never find me. I was certain I would have heard from him by now. But no. So...there you have my random ROCKY HORROR hookup. He really was an amazing guy...I was completely enraptured...which doesn't happen often.  Wish me luck!

       Okay, well I managed to sleep well...FINALLY! I see they haven't made too much progress on that submarine thingy.  So, who watched the 2gether: The Series premiere? :::Looking out over Bloggerland to see all the teen girly hands raised:::  I only got to see part of the end of the episode. I adored the MAKING THE VIDEO for "The Hardest Part of Breaking Up (Is Getting Back Your Stuff)." No one spoofs the boyband phenomenon better than the people who created 2gether!!    Is anyone else having trouble concentrating???

       Hmmmm...I am beginning to wonder about the full moon. I'm not sleeping well, I'm lethargic, I'm in a crappy mood all day...nothing seems interesting or fun. I hate being in a funk!! So, I am determined to get thru it as swiftly as possible!  I think somebody needs to tell me a funny story...or at least one with a happy ending - what with those Russian sailors stuck at the bottom of the Barents Sea in a broken-down submarine. Is anyone doing anything to get them outta there? Seems a lot of Russian officials are doing  a lot of hemming and hawing on the whole thing....meanwhile I'm sure the U.S. and other countries could have been assisting at this point. By the time Russia agrees to let other nations help, there will be no oxygen left. See what I mean about my funky mood?! Damn!  Maybe I should just go read Dr. Seuss.

       So, today's challenge is to figure out a successful marketing & PR plan for (get this) VERIOVKA, The Ukrainian National Folk Dance Company. Okay...so how do I approach this one? Slam some ads in the Russian newspaper? Or do I simply toss a couple ads in The Ukrainian paper and hope that does the trick. I don't think any of my parents' country-club friends would be remotely interested in buying a ticket, so who am I supposed to sell 'em to???  College students? Teen Girlies?! I wish it would be that easy! "Buy a ticket to VERIOVKA and get a free NSYNC (fill in the blank) with every purchase. Man, we'd be sold-out right away. The only problem would be, no one would actually show up at the theatre for the performance. Once they got their free NSYNC thing, they'd be gandhi...you know what I am saying???   Let me know if you have any brilliant ideas...okay?

       I spent the morning with a ghostbuster...rooting through old theaters and meeting ghosts. Sounds fun, eh? Apparently, when you die, you have free will...a choice of whether or not to cross into "the light." Mary Ann says it lasts for about 72-80 hours...and then it vanishes. There are lots of reasons people don't cross...but you get stuck here if you don't. The only way to cross again it to totally bogart someone else's light....like at a funeral home OR a medium like Mary Ann can create it. I know it all sounds totally cracked...but what the hey?

       Popstar phenomenon...it's an interesting thing. A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to witness the greatest pop sensation of the past year - NSYNC, live and sans Britney. I am here to report that the path to popstardom is strewn with halter tops, Caboodles and body glitter. Our trek to the NSYNC concert was not an easy one. No, the casual onlooker might have seen two late twentysomethings wading thru a sea of teen girly hormones, but we were on our own mission. A mission that would leave thousands listless, dreamless and heartbroken, or at least jealous for a few minutes.     I had the dubious luck of receiving a coveted backstage Meet and Greet pass for the band's 2000 No Strings Attached Tour. Yes, I have peered into the very mouth of the beast, a mouth that smells of wintergreen Altoids and bubble gum lipgloss. In case you've been living under a rock, NSA is one of this summer's hottest tickets and grossed an average of $1,000,000 per date...52 dates so far. You do the math. Anyhow, back to the backstage passes. I made the score on a Wednesday, phoned up my friend Trish and prepped her for the chaos that was to be our Friday night. We met our contact at the arena at the appointed time. There we were, corralled with 100 other fans - every single one of them 14 and smelling like the sale wagon at Bath and Body Works...I digress...    We were all shuffled into the arena, around the corner, down some dark, dank staircase into the bowels of the venue. We were held at a checkpoint for 20 minutes and then asked to proceed into the press room. This militia-concert-publicist woman gave us the rules of the game: NO SQUEALING "the guys hate the squealing," she said. DO NOT SCREAM WHEN THE GUYS ENTER THE ROOM. "This is a small room and we don't need to deafen them, now do we?" THE PEOPLE SEATED IN THE FRONT ROWS MUST NOT STAND UP, THEREBY BLOCKING THE 14 YEAR OLDS AND THEIR PARENTS IN SUBSEQUENT ROWS. "Please do not leave the area around your chair....your chairea."  Well THANK GOD the rules had been set. Otherwise, I might have been creamed to a pulp. Images to recent concert-tramplings flashed in my head...Madonna, Prince, Pearl  Jam, Urkel....the list goes on. The truth is, one false move, and I might have started a riot. One careless head toss to the doorway and the room FREAKS out. Anyway, we waited...we waited a VERY long time until our Princes of Pop arrived...without fanfare...and looking quite bleary-eyed and downright sleepy. I hoped I hadn't interrupted anything important  .  Of course, against Melinda's (Queen of NSYNC Meet-N-Greets) wishes, the screaming and squealing began...first as a rumble and then an all-out nuclear explosion. I wondered about all the fuss. I mean - sure - they were all there: Justin, Chris, Lance, Joey and JC, but they looked like, well, they looked like every other 23 year old...like Hell. Okay, not really, I just say that to tease the throng of screaming teenagers...the teenagers who DIDN'T get the chance to meet NSYNC in person.    So, FIRST of all, we're told that the guys will have their picture taken, then they will take a few questions (oooh I CAN'T wait to find out what little Miss Thang behind me has to say) and then we'll be brought up row by row to have something signed...but NO BODY PARTS! (Okay, we're safe on that one) WELL....the picture taking commences...it's like paparazzi...gum chewing, Daisy Duke-wearing, disposable camera paparazzi. Now remember...we've been told not to leave our "chairea" so I have no choice but to hold my camera up high and just click away....hoping and praying the lens captures something...ANYTHING, really. Like a periscope, my arm telescopes high above the meticulously coifed and Aquanetted...CLICK! I hope I got that one of Joey...CLICK! CLICK! I hope I just got one of Lance or JC...or who IS that, anyway? CLICK CLICK CLICK Darn! No flash! Satisfied I had taken any and all available shots, I set the camera down...just to watch the circus unfolding in front of me. There they were, the BIGGEST and BEST SELLING boyband this year! It was like having the opportunity to see Michael Jackson on the Victory Tour, or Madonna in Blonde Ambition...except that none of my peers were there...heck...they couldn't believe I was there. "What the HECK are you gonna go see NSYNC for? Huh?" The best ammo: "Well, I really like them." Enough said.  So, there it was: QUESTION AND ANSWER time! Just imagine the pearls of wisdom just WAITING, WAITING I tell you, to fall from the lips of our boyband royalty. I could barely contain myself. Well...picture the wonder and amazement when one teen girly said it was her friend's birthday (on that VERY day) and she had a birth certificate to prove it...and would NSYNC sing Happy Birthday to her? Well, Joey stepped right up and started singing. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? An hour and a half before their concert and Miss Teen Girlie-Q has our boys singing. So, the dust settles from the little birthday incident and we are treated to other morsels like, "do you have a girlfriend" or "what's your favorite color?" During this barrage of nonsensical and inane questioning, the most startling thing occurred: I got cruised by NSYNC. Well, not the whole of NSYNC, just one of them...Joey. Okay, okay.. I know people are gonna freak out. It's JUST am implication. No confirmation...YET. Anyway, there I was....sitting in the fourth row, center....right next to GIANT pole. Joey looks at me. And keeps looking at me. He's staring...at me...and he doesn't break his gaze. After 8 or 9 seconds, I couldn't take the heat anymore, so I tossed my head to the side to look at something...ANYTHING...all I got was an eyeful of pole...big beige support column. Yes, I felt like a total DORK. Ha ha ha..."just me and this here pole...ha ha...heh..." Fortunately, Trish says Joey looked away as soon as I did and he DID NOT see the pole incident. Thank GOD! But, while that conversation is happening, Joey starts his staredown again. Shameless! He didn't care WHO was looking & he knew we had busted him for staring...but NONE of it stopped him. Go figure.    When I made it through the Meet-N-Greet line, he stared at me as he squiggled his name onto my CD booklet. Without breaking his gaze, he finished and slid it over to JC. If you compare Trish's booklet and mine, there is a remarkable difference. Anyhoo...that's the "How I Got Cruised By NSYNC" story. Hope you enjoyed.

       Today was one of those absolutely gorgeous fall days. The temperature was just about 70 degrees, and the sun was bright and the sky, blue.  I went to Gap to buy Kelly a birthday gift and EVERY clerk in the store asked if I needed any help. I know I must have looked helpless in the women's section, but I do know what Kelly likes. Fortunately, I got the sizes right and she loved the outfit I picked. I cut the lawn for possibly the last time this season...I don't expect it'll grow much more. We went to Kelly's birthday dinner at a really wonderful Ethiopian restaurant called Empress Taytu. Matt called today from CHicago - twice. I guess he misses me as much as I miss him. I'm looking forward to seeing him tomorrow night when he gets home.

       It feels strange not to have you here with me, but I guess it's a good thing  to miss somebody. God, I wish I could tell you how much I like you...but  words just aren't enough. I had a great time tonight with Kelly, but I really  missed being with you. Not a moment passed tonight when I didn't think of you.  You make me want to write poetry.

       I came home today to a very sick Kelly. She spent the day vomiting and sleeping, alternately. We did manage to get some food into her, which seemed to make a difference. Hopefully, when she wakes up tomorrow (her birthday) she'll be feeling 100% better! As for me, I am wandering around my rather empty house thinking about Matt...wondering if he's had a safe trip to Chicago. I imagine that I'll be heading to bed soon. Maybe I'll do some reading and a little more writing. I need to write another song soon or Doug's going to come after me. Maybe this one will be a happy/hopeful love song.

       I just received a promotional CD from RCA Victor which has two songs on it...Christina Aguilera's  Come On Over , and Christina Aguilera's  Ven Conmigo ...as if the English version wasn't irritating enough. Still, it's quite amusing because it's an enhanced CD which contains the full-length music video for said song. You can play/pause whenever...and I'm thinking of doing some fun digital reconstruction.

       I am thinking about road-tripping next weekend with Matthew. We're going to go to Philly (Philadelphia, for my foreign readers) to visit his family and friends. It seems so spontaneous and fun. Trish was gracious enough to offer us both a place to stay, even though it's not determined what Matt is doing at this point regarding lodging. Road trips are fun - especially if there are road games to play. We are also considering shooting over to NYC briefly to have dinner with Ali and her family. I'm not sure how big I am on that idea (sounds like a lot of traveling for one weekend). However, he is eager for me to meet his surrogate family. Matt is (as I write) on his way to Chicago to spend the weekend with a friend. I look forward to a weekend of rest and relaxation.

       I spoke to my friend Abra this morning. I met her on the National Tour of MISS SAIGON this past season, and she has become a wonderful friend, along with Tiffini. They were the Company Managers for the now defunct tour. Abra is now the Asst. Company Manager of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA on Broadway, and Tiffini is Company Managing a new show in California (for now). It was great catching up with her. Hopefully, we'll get to see each other soon.

This should be very interesting to see...as I have no faith in their ability to pull it off successfully. They're both Republicans, for God's sake...and Republicans are NOT cool. Republicans are typically the LAST people you'd wanna see with a bare midriff and afro-blonde hair.

       What a show! Barenaked Ladies were awesome!!! Matt and I had so much fun together at the show. He really seemed to enjoy his first pop/rock concert experience. We were able to laugh, meet new people in the loge and DRINK for FREE (which is always a major bonus in my book). This crazy married couple sent us a round of chocolate shots which are, in effect, a shot of Bailey's in an edible chocolate shotglass. After the concert, I brought Matt home to my house where we jumped into my big 2-person whirlpool bathtub. Soon afterward, we went to bed...drifting off to sleep next to each other. There is nothing so blissful as sleeping next to someone you really like. Yes, I suffered NBS (New Bed Syndrome) even though it was my bed. I always do. He had trouble sleeping as well...but we've vowed to practice, practice, practice until we get it right. This morning, I drove him back to the Institute for his 8:30 class. I drove home, showered and arrived at work at 8:55. Not bad, eh?

       Matt and I are going to see the Barenaked Ladies concert tonight at Gund Arena (say it real fast and it sounds like a venereal disease). We scored tix in a private loge from a friend of mine. Hopefully, it'll be a great show! I've heard that BNL is wonderful live. This will also be one of the first "pop" concerts Matt has ever attended...he's always going to those classical concertos and stuff. Won't this be a change?!

       Okay, so we didn't see "Woman On Top." Instead, we went to see a free screening of "Girlfight," which was an unmitigated DISASTER beyond your imagination. The actress in the lead did a fabulous job with the lousy script she was dealt. Otherwise, the whole thing is a GIANT BUST!

       So, Matt is a student at the Institute of Music (one of the best schools in the country) and he's training to be a composer. He's really quite talented, and is teching me a lot about classical music. I really really like him - and everyday he becomes more and more endeared to me. It's hard to explain after it being so long ago that I even felt remotely similar feelings about someone. I truly don't know him well - there is so much to learn. What I do know about him, I love. How often was I like that cat in the Pepe LePew cartoons...scrambling to get away? I can't seem to get enough of Matt. This is simply an observation I find quite interesting. One of his most important attributes is that he's from Philly...which automatically makes him extremely high on my list. LOL You know how I love my peeps from Philadelphia.

       We had a terrific evening riding the train. We had a staff outing last night which consisted of riding an old train through one of our National Forest areas. It really was quite fun, and included dinner, bar and lots of interoffice gossip. I had the chance to catch up with an old friend, who was a guest of Rachel's. Kimberly, Heather and I went for a drink (or two) at the Fulton AFTER the trip...at which point it was absolutely necessary to return home and fall fast asleep.

       I had a terrific evening with Matt! I picked him up at the airport as scheduled. I arrived a few minutes early and watched from the observation deck. There's something really quite pretty about the airport at dusk. I watched his jet land, and then taxi. I met him at the gate, and we chattered the rest of the walk to the parking garage. When we got to the car, a more proper welcome home was exchanged. :)  He played Alisa's CD for me - she's an excellent cellist (the person he was visiting in NYC). We had a late dinner at Luchita's, and then I drove him back home. I did finally get to see the interior of the dorm room. What a flashback! It was with much difficulty that I tore myself away from his beautiful lips...and drove back to Aurora.

       I went to the Tremont Arts & Cultural Festival today in Lincoln Park. Besides the grayish day, everything was perfect! I had a wonderful time visiting with people from the neighborhood. I ran into Hottie Jon from across the street...he's sporting a pretty healthy/hairy goatee these days. Apparently, he's back in his MBA program. He invited me to come over whenever I wanted...but Sundays were especially good. Weird, no? I spent a lot of time over at the City of Cleveland Kennels booth playing with puppies and the cute guys hanging around them. I am so bad! Nice to know there are always opportunities, I guess. Right now, I'm going to a cook-out/bonfire down in the wilds of Medina County with Margaret. It's at the home of our friend Laurie. It sounds like a really fun way to spend an autumn evening. Don't know when I'll be back to post, so for now...be well...and most importantly...DON'T behave.  Peace.

He loves it so much there he's seriously thinking of tranferring to Columbia. Go for it, is what I said. God knows, there's nothing worse than feeling stuck in a place you don't like very much. I know he'd rather be in a major metropolitan area than in Cleveland. So, I guess we'll see what happens.

Marc called and said he was sorry for earlier confusion (see: Circus of Embarrassment, posted Sept. 13) regarding the WRONG DAVID. However, the David I was interested in is named DAVID BROGAN (sp?) who, he believes, is currently dating someone. He said that David had my number and would call me.  No, really...that's okay...if you're not single, don't bother.   Anyway, the mystery unfolds. it will be interesting to see  if  he actually calls. I'll be sure to keep you updated.

       Okay, full report on the date last night. I picked Matt up at 8pm. We drove to the Cedar-Lee Theatre to see "Saving Grace." Matt played two pieces he composed, one was a piece for solo Cello, and one was a Concertina for 40+ instruments. To say this guy is extremely talented is a gross understatement. I was really moved by his work. We had a mandarin martini before the movie (yummy!) and I could be carted away for contributing to underage drinking. As it turns out, he will be 21 in November. Lord help me rob this cradle!! LOL. Anyway, we had a delightful evening...and ONLY Trish gets all the details.

       Update: I picked Matt up outside his dorm as planned. We went to lunch at the Cleveland Museum of Art...they've got a great little cafe there. We each grabbed a chicken caesar salad and some beverages, sat down and had a thoroughly charming, silly, giggly lunch. Afterwards, I drove him back...he wanted to drive around with me for awhile, but I had to get back to work. I dropped him off...and in the process, earned a kiss or two. FYI: he's a good kisser. We ALL know how important that is!

       Almost made you love me. Almost made you cry. Almost made you happy, baby, Didn't I? Didn't I? You almost had me thinkin' you were turned around, but everybody knows Almost doesn't count. Almost heard you sayin' you were finally free. What was always missing for you, baby...you'd found it in me. But you can't get to Heaven half off the ground. Everybody knows Almost doesn't count. I can't keep on lovin' you one foot outside the door. I hear a funny hesitation of a heart that's never really sure. Can't keep on trying if you're looking for more than all that I could give you, than what you came here for. Gonna find somebody not afraid to let go. Want a no doubt be there kind of man. You came real close. But every time you built me up, you only let me down. And, everybody knows...Almost doesn't count. Maybe you'll be sorry. Maybe you'll be cold. Maybe you'll come running back, baby, from the cruel, cruel world. Almost convince me you're gonna stick around. But everybody knows, Almost doesn't count. So maybe I'll be here. Maybe I'll see you around. That's the way it goes. Almost doesn't count. (S. Peiken/G. Roche)

       The meeting went exceptionally well! Little to NO outbursts, if you can believe it! We muddled through it in a little less than three hours, which should make the Annual Meeting a breeze. In other news, Trish comes back today and I can't wait to talk to her and catch up on EVERYTHING. She's been in St. Lucia with her boss, so I'm sure she wasn't getting any SUGAR...or into ANY mischief for that matter.

       So I talked to Matt. He got home from school and left a message on my cell phone. So I called him back. He really didn't have anything to say, but he asked if he could call me back in a little while...which he did. We just chatted about daily stuff...nothing much, actually, and he left to go have dinner. He's got a history exam tomorrow, so tonight will be a studying frenzy. Okay...

       Choosing photographs for a new book is not as easy as you would think. We're publishing a book about the history of our 5 theaters...productions, stars, etc...and it apparently takes 7-8 people to decide which pics we're using. Mind you, this task was almost useless as many of us have not even read the copy. I had a dreadful board meeting tonight out in Chagrin. Tonight is the meeting where we get to present the board re-unification document to both sides. I am confident, however, that Tim's and my work on it has been balanced enough to circumvent any real explosions or roadblocks. Wish me luck. You know how I love meetings (especially long ones).

       Life seems a little off-kilter with Trish off the continent in St. Lucia. We typically talk every night before bed, but since she's traveling, I've had to fend for myself. I wonder what it's like in St. Lucia...the furthest south I've been in the Caribbean is St. Maarten/St. Martin.

       Naturally, this will be the time that everything falls in place with Mystery David. This is the way of the Universe, isn't it?? I mean...it's always feast or famine. I can just feel it. This week I'm going to get the Mystery David info, I'll call him, ask him out and find out where all of that stands. Maybe he's already involved at this point. Who knows?

       I haven't yet learned to read his vocal non-verbals or his physical non-verbals. Actions speak louder than words, so in that sense, he's golden. I think this kid has no fear. Less fear, anyway, than me or most adults I know. I know...he's an adult. He just seems so young to me...and he is. Damaged goods, definitely...there seems to be a lot of pain, heartbreak and mistrust. But we all remember those phases of our lives...I do. Nothing will make everything all better. I just wish him peace and joy. I really seem to like him - try as I may no to, but I can't help it.

       Matt really surprises me...not that I know him so well, but just when I start to think I know him (even just a little bit) he ends up saying/doing/writing something that sends me reeling in a different direction. We had a great conversation last night, which I'll fill you in on in a little while...

       So, the concensus seems to be that I should proceed without caution with Matt. Okay...this from my friend Rachel (28) who is dating a 19 year old. Maybe she just wants company when it comes to cradle robbing. Just kidding, Rach...really.

       Rachel and I just stopped down to see the matinee performance of Julius LaRosa begin. He's an old crooner...so we wanted to check it out. Lo and behold, upon going back to the office, who do I bump into? None other than Dr. Tom visiting the building - he likes our coffee shop. Always nice to run into a handsome face.

       Here it is, Monday morning again. The people on the West 52nd to West 57th blocks did not sleep well last night...there was a massive housefire that sent several people to the hospital and torched a good part of a house. The ambulances, firetrucks and other assorted rescue vehicles numbered well into the teens. The constant sirens and high-speed racing down the street was enough to bring most of us outside in our pajamas and/or other sleep attire. Then, when all of that settled down, the construction crew of the new housing project on the OTHER side of my house got busy....cutting cement. Needless to say, it was an incredibly LOUD morning. I'm thrilled that I'm not cranky.

       Terrific day, really. Spent a few hours with my family and extended family out in the country. Then, I raced back home to accompany Kelly to Thanksgiving in September, an annual dinner given by one of her closest friends, Julie. The food was wonderful,  but the turkey is making me quite sleepy. I am still attempting to finish my laundry started yesterday. Have been asked out on a date by Matt - a handsome and quite charming student at the Cleveland Institute of Music. My only qualms revolve around his age. He is 21 or 22...I raise an eyebrow...

       I am terribly behind in my play-reading for the Play Study committee at the Chagrin Valley Little Theatre, or CVLT, as we call  it. These are the titles I am supposed to be reading RIGHT NOW: "Camping with Henry and Tom" by Mark St. Germain, "Over the River and Through the Woods" by Joe DiPietro, "The Last Night of Ballyhoo" by Alfred Uhry, "Side Man" by Warren Leight and "The Compleat Works of Wllm. Shkspr (abridged)" by The Reduced Shakespeare Company. So, I had better get busy and get some of this reading done. I must stop this Godless and infernal writing (the Devil's work) and get back to reading. Goodbye for now!

       Trish suggested that maybe you all needed an update on the whole Mystery David situation. After the comedy of the situation wore off, I was faced with the reality of waiting an entire week to find the true identity of this man. SO this is where I am: not worried and not really waiting...just intrigued to find out who this guy is.  Now, if you really want my opinion...I think I'd rather jet over to the UK and ask Tom (from plasticbag.org) out on a proper date. I'd insert the link to his site, but right now I'm using my old (quite old, in fact) Mac Centris...which can't do much of anything. I'm surprised it even allows me to post this much.

       Saturday in the fall. It is as it should be: beautiful, crisp and a tad chilly...just like yesterday. I was thinking about taking Toby for a walk down by the lake this afternoon. The waves are surely crashing over the breakwall. Other than doing some general organizing around the house, I have only one real scheduled event, and that's dinner tonight at Phil's house. It should be an intimate gathering: Phil, myself, Jim, Carrie and Marianne.

       Today was one of those autumn days to see in magazines or movies. Where the day is alternately crisp, clear and beatiful...and gray, chilly and the wind whips in across Lake Erie...seemingly from all directions. Almost as if it's not sure which direction to go, it lashes you, and circles back and lashes you again. The oppressive heat and humidity of late August has give way to the more temporal and indecisiveness of fall. The temperatures have fallen from the 90's down to the 50's and 60's. The trees have not yet begun to change color, but I am certain within a few days the first tinges will appear...ever so slightly at first, and the bursting forth with fiery array.

       I subscribed to this entertainment/gossip magazine so I could receive the free gift (which was all I really wanted): Absolute 80's. It's a double CD set with all those weird songs we liked growing up in the 80's. Remember "Sugar Walls" or "We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off (To Have a Good Time)" or what about "C'est La Vie?" THOSE were some TUNES!  Not a single ACTUAL instrument on any of 'em. Ahhh...the synthesizer at it's best. Moog. Those were the classic days of artificial sound.

       There was a part 2 to last night's circus of embarrassment. I called a mutual acquaintance whose name is Tom (not Dr. Tom). I had seem Tom and his friend Bill speaking to Mystery David during intermission of ROCKY HORROR. When I called Tom, I explained the crazy events thus far and he agreed to call Bill and find out this guy's last name. He added that he thought it was awfully cute that I would go to such measures to find someone. When he called, he confirmed that David REALLY is David's correct first name, but that neither he nor Bill actually know what his LAST name is. Again: "Hello, Todd! Meet SQUARE ONE." So, now I have called back Mark to let him know he sent me to the WRONG David...and if he could please think back and remember the ACTUAL 3 people he went with to ROCKY HORROR. He is out of town for another week, so I gotta wait. So, what else is new?

       Oh my god. It's NOT him. The Mystery David that was located and identified is the WRONG person ENTIRELY! This kind person returned my call this evening. And, while he DID know the mutual friend, he was not the David that attended ROCKY HORROR...in fact, he hadn't seen it at all. I apologized for the awkwardness and the inconvenience. He was exceedingly sweet and said he was disappointed that he wasn't the right guy. So, now  we're back at SQUARE ONE, o blog! What to do? Well, our mutual contact is back out of town for yet another week, so I suppose we'll have to wait. Unreal. This kinda stuff only happens to me...in case you were wondering.

       So, I was talking to a friend of mine at JIVE Records the other day...you know, JIVE, the home of, like, ALL the major bubblegummy pop acts: NSYNC, Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, Aaron Carter, Joe...etc. And he says that the Backstreet Boys first release offa the new album will be uptempo...THANK GOD! They need to pull off a "Bye Bye Bye" in order to stay up in the rankings. I was thinking that the next new Olympic sport officially recognized by the IOC is: boybands. What do you think? I think it could work!

       I love the Appalachian Trail (most of my friends already know this). I have been on the trail twice, and have read almost every journal published on the subject. The trail extends 2,100 miles from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Katahdin ("greatest mountain") in Maine. I have a map of the entire trail on the wall next to my desk. It reminds me of the people who, every year, attempt to walk the entire distance. They inspire me. Kinda minimizes any challenges I face. Every so often I just say to myself, "2,100 miles."

       Does anyone else get sugar-shock or sugar-coma after eating dessert? I was taken to lunch today by one of my favorite sales reps, and she practically FORCED me to eat an entire wedge of delicious Key Lime pie. Okay, so I scarfed it up willingly, but the point is: that action is directly related to my inability to concentrate, stay awake and stay seated all at the same time. Sugar is surely a demon...sent from hell...where they make chocolate.

       There are crickets in the basement. Well, at least one REALLY NOISY cricket. At night, if you're anywhere near the kitchen or family room, all you can hear over the din of the television is the high-pitched chirp of a creature that SHOULD be living in the great outdoors. I went looking for it to no avail. The sound kept moving around the room...like it was throwing its voice...or tweeter...or whatever. So, I am resigned to live with this thing until it kicks the bucket.

       I am going back into the studio tonight to do some final mixing on a couple of tracks I've been working on for weeks. Doug (collaboration partner) says that it's REALLY sounding good, and he hopes to have the first 4 tunes shipped out and shopped in the next month. With all of his high-level connections, maybe I actually WILL sell a song. With my crappy luck, I'd sell my first tune to some low-brow outfit like "O-Town" (from ABC's "Making the Band") or Aaron Carter ( little bro to Backstreet Boys' Nick Carter ).

       Okay, I know I've been on this rant about meetings lately...but I seriously wanted to poke out my eyeballs today. The culprit was merely a 45 minute meeting to brief everyone on the progress of this new book we're publishing. As is typical, various participants start rambling WAY off course. I can't believe how inefficient some people are with words. They talk and talk and talk and barely say anything. Meanwhile, you realize you just wasted 45 minutes of your life that you will NEVER get back. I pouted all the way back to my desk.

       My sleeptime bliss was shattered this morning by the scraping and whining of the garbage truck. Today is not garbage day, I thought. But maybe today IS garbage day...maybe it's time to throw out all the old, to make room for the new. So, I think I am going to start chucking things left and right. From my old Weeble-Wobbles set to my shampoo...it's ALL garbage. Less is more, right?! Right! So, off you go...get cracking! Just throw it all out! My advice: keep any pets or loved ones, they're MUCH harder to replace in the event you need them. Maybe every day should be garbage day. I need to simplify and declutter my life. That will be a new mission from today forward: no more squirrelling away unneeded papers and objects....THINGS.  We'll see how long THIS lasts.

       I forgot to mention...last night (around 10pm) a bouquet of freshly cut flowers appeared, mysteriously, on the windshield of Kelly's Jeep. There was no note, and it was only tied together by a red bandana. For the life of me, I can't figure out who would leave flowers on a Jeep in the middle of the night with no note. Neither one of us can figure it out. I wanted to think they were for me, but the windshield of my car bore nothing more than birdcrap.

Tonight, I am going home to do only exciting things like...well, like my laundry. It doesn't get much better than this!  ha ha ha.

       Right, so...today starts with a Board meeting for the theatre where I volunteer. We are in the midst of reading scripts to choose the 01-02 season. As I am driving home (Noonish) I receive a phone call from Kelly saying that someone was trying to break into our garage. Apparently this MORON decided to try the break-in in midday with over 5 neighbors watching him. Don't worry...he didn't manage to bust his way into the (very empty) garage. He did manage to get himself caught by the police. However, because he didn't ACTUALLY break-in, they can't arrest him. And even though there were so many eyewitnesses, they don't have enough evidence. Whatever. Kelly and I are now quite paranoid...something that will rub off in a few days, I'm sure.   On a happier note, I went back into the recording stuidio today to clean up a few tunes - and THAT went exceedingly well! Yay me. I'm not sure what my plans for this evening will be, but I'll let you know, eventually. Peace.

       More random babbling (I'm in a writing mood today). Catching an eyeful: today started out REALLY well! You'll all remember Dr. Tom...right? As I was leaving the house this morning, around 8:30am EST, Dr. Tom comes bolting out of his house with a bag of garbage in nothing but boxer shorts! Well, I almost hit the passing school bus as I pulled out onto the street. However, the joke is really on him. Garbage day isn't until tomorrow.

       Yesterday turned out to be much more interesting than planned. I was doing some valid research on the state of mullet haircuts in today's society when, out of nowhere, this guy from AOL starts chatting me up. Okay - no big deal, right? So, we're chatting and I'm, of course, still doing my mullet research and everything is fine until, BANG! he wants to introduce me to his boyfriend of 3 years and would I mind coming over and "getting to know" both of them. "HA!" I said. If it isn't enough already that I'm flirting with half of the city, but the boys who want to sleep with me are already paired-off. Anyway, I declined the kind offer and returned to my work. THEN something REALLY special happened: my Director from TWILIGHT OF THE GOLDS called me with some very hush-hush information. She had learned thru various sources that I received top honors at the OCTA Festival last week. I was named "Best Actor" for the entire hoo-ha!  Can you believe it?!?! I was absolutely overwhelmed and honored...I really had no inkling that our show would win ANYTHING. Then, to top it off, Vonnie also received the top honor for her portrayal of "Phyllis" (my mother in the show). So, we scored big TWICE! After all that schlepping and bitching about being in Toledo, we go and do THIS. Anyway, it is supposed to be a surprise when we are officially recognized on Monday evening. But, I had to tell someone.

       The concert was an interesting experience in cultural anthropology. I have never seen so many mullet haircuts in my life. You'd think it was a monster truck rally. I was trying to get an accurate read on the audience. There were truckers and prom queens, advertising execs and theatre queens, bad hair and camel toes. But, the music...the music was great! And hey - the band ain't bad looking, either. After the show, Kelly and I went to one of our old haunts, the Parkview, to check out the Wednesday night blues jam. We ran into one of Kelly's more notorious exes, Kevin. At about 12:30, I peeled her out of there and we both went home and collapsed.

My friend Trish and Kelly sent me a FedEx full of goodies, which include: two videotapes of my vacations with Trish AND a video copy of my performance of TWILIGHT OF THE GOLDS. Also, Kelly sent me the new Jim Brickman CD which I have been wanting to purchase. Along with all of this, I received two cards, and I can tell you this: there is nothing better than the love and adoration of friends! (Well, except for chocolate mousse) Thanks, guys!!

       Another bright, sunny, clear day. Temperature: approximately 70 degrees. No humidity. I'd really rather be outside. One question: are you REALLY ACTUALLY excited for the Olympics? I just don't seem to find them exciting anymore. Maybe I'm wrong. Anyway, today, I am working on the National Tour of CABARET. I have to present the Marketing and PR strategy - so that might keep me busy for a while.

       Not much new to report on the boy-front. Kelly and I made a quick trip to the store tonight to satisfy some sort of feeding-urge. Hers was sweet...mine, salty. I ended up getting some barbeque flavored SOY NUTS (very yum) and she decided on some Gummi letters of the alphabet. I never liked anything Gummi...including the bears. Jelly candy just doesn't do it for me.

       Hold your breath. I have made forays into contacting "Mystery David" from that ROCKY HORROR night a few weeks ago. Let's see if anything pans out. I called his friend Marc in hopes of getting David's digits. Keep your fingers crossed.

       Dear Blog, Today I cut my sister's hair off. It started out innocently enough...just a trim here and a trim there. In my effort to keep everything even, I kept clipping...until she looked like Demi Moore in the Navy SEALs movie. Well, seriously pissed-off is not quite accurate when it comes to describing my sister's reaction. I, on the other hand, think she looks quite fetching with her new do. After all, there ARE benefits...it dries really fast in the morning, she won't need to apply ungodly amounts of hair styling products and she looks really TOUGH. In a phrase: wash-n-go. I told her it would only take 12 weeks to grow out. That's when the kitchen knives got pulled. I'll be staying at my friend's house for the next, I don't know, 12 weeks?

       Well, I have returned...alive...and no worse for the wear. However, we learned upon arrival in Toledo that this competition was not, in fact, a competition. No, no no...it was simply a festival to showcase our "amazing" talent. Well, if we fucking KNEW that in advance, we wouldn't have FUCKING hauled our asses all the way to Toledo. I suspect the other entries would have done the same - which is why they didn't tell anyone. Our excerpt went very well, we sold out the theatre for our performance. Apparently, the rest of the regions had heard about our little show. Anyway, as predicted, we hit the mark...there was laughing, yelling, tenderness and even tears on cue! I love it when it all works. Anyway, there were some sort of individual awards being handed out today, but we all left so we could get home and enjoy what was left of our Labor Day holiday. So, now I contemplate making a quick visit with my family for the evening. At any rate, I shall report back when I know anything re: awards.

       Saturday morning. Drinking some coffee, pondering WHEN I should take off for Toledo. For those of you who don't know, let me give you a brief geography lesson. Toledo is located in the Northwest corner of the state of Ohio.  Together with it's Northeastern corner city (Youngstown) they comprise of what is known as the  "armpits" of Ohio. So, it is without much joy and elation that I leave this place (Cleveland) and head to Toledo. However, if I manage, with the rest of my cast, to win...the trip to Ohio's Hell will have been worth it. But, here it is, Saturday, and all the possibilities here will just have to wait. I had a strange dream last night. I was picking up a friend from film school and we were flying over the campus. Then, we went to the cafeteria where we ate only grapes. That's all I can remember. Does anyone have one of those dream analysis books?

       Just under the wire! I was hoping to post today - you know how I hate skipping. Anyway, I received a few interesting emails in the past 24 hours that induced some pondering. Two were from an old flame, Eden, who was just saying hello...chatting about the imminent return of his boyfriend from being at sea and how he felt nervous about it and wasn't sure why. When I started to ask questions, he got a little defensive, but asked if he could call me later this week. This is a milestone, of course, because Eden is the worst "keeper in toucher" in the world.  The other email was from an even older flame, the ex love of my life, Lee. He's finally feeling settled in Miami and liking his new hospital. He's now on rotations and that crazy hospital/doctor schedule they put you on for a few years. He also announced he is now dating someone wonderful. Which, makes me both happy for him and wistful at the same time. It's always hard to hear about the love of your life falling in love with someone else. And, I know, you might say well...Todd, you're so busy all the time flirting and meeting people, what does it matter? And you'd be right. It doesn't matter much, but I believe in feeling how I'm feeling at any given moment and not denying it.  I am certain I'm due for love again soon - as long as it doesn't come in the form of my last few exes. I'm off to Toledo tomorrow and Sunday to compete in the State Finals for Theatre. I will be performing two scenes from THE TWILIGHT OF THE GOLDS. Wish me and us luck. God, I really don't want to go to Toledo. Yuck.

       This in an email from Matt just now:   hey baby... just wanted to say hi... i love you. i want you to know that, and remember it clearly :) im sorry i get so frustrated so easily.... :( talk to you soon... yours ..    My response:   dear Matt, first off (and most importantly) let me tell you that I LOVE YOU and I love you more every day that goes by...I love you so much sometimes it hurts (in a good way)   secondly, accept my apologies for my ill timing I always have the need to talk about things and forget (sometimes) there may be a better time and place and method   I'm looking forward to talking, baby.   I love you.   yours, me

       Well...the talks are in progress...interrupted by his need to dart off to class. He was upset at my timing (perhaps, rightfully so) but I have difficulty tailoring my interpersonal communication to meet schedules...I can do it professionally (I'm in PR) but it's a whole different story when it's my life. Anyway...I'm hoping for a positive outcome on this one. Keep your fingers crossed.

       I was interviewed on a morning radio show today, which was broadcasting live from the Palace Theatre (one of the theatres where I work). We talked about ghosts and hauntings and fun stuff like that...the interview was terrific...which made getting up so freakin' early kinda worth it. Matt called me no fewer than 10 times between last evening and this morning. Seems like he really wants to talk to me...which is good...because   we need to talk . Those dreaded four words...

       Yesterday was like a dream - like everything that happened was out of some sort of perfect script...the way your boyfriend is supposed to meet your parents. It was incredible! It was so comfortable and sweet and enjoyable - eveyone had a wonderful experience...unless they're flat-out lying to me (I don't think so). So, the always-nerve-wracking "meet the parents" thing is overwith...and it was great! We'll all do it again sometime! Mom was a dream: sweet, welcoming, warm and funny. Dad was engaging, fun and put Matt at ease right away.

       I have to string up Christmas lights tomorrow. Isn't it a little early? We received a memo at work requesting us to "volunteer" our time helping decorate Star Plaza (on the exterior of our offices) with X-Mas lights & the like. They're luring people down here on a Saturday with promises of food, drink and a good time...heh-heh...YEAH. My boss put the whole thing together, so guess who's ass is down there at 9am? Yep...me.

       I just had a delightful conversation with Lee! He's doing well in Miami, and has met a terrific new boyfriend named Rodney. They are moving in together within the next two months, partially an economic move because Lee is so "poor" right now. Rodney sells cellular communications service in South America, so he travels frequently, but Lee says they've been able to spend a good amount of time together. Lee seems truly happy and settled into his life...something I haven't seen in a long time.

       Finally saw Matt yesterday. He spent the night. I barely slept...and not for the reasons you think (get your mind out of the gutter). Not sure why, actually. I hate sleeplessness. Sex would have helped...I always sleep better after...anyway, the TMI siren is going off. Good morning (I'm barely lucid).

       So, imagine my horror and disappointment when I sign onto AOL yesterday and find Matt online in the Chicago M4M room (gay smut chat room). Mortified. Hurt. Angry. Upset. After calming myself down, I finally talked with him. He apologized profusely...admitting he'd be livid if the tables were turned. Anyway...I want to trust him. I don't have the strength or energy to be suspicious. I think our relationship is a little clearer at this point...I won't tolerate any fuck-ups in the trust category. He said he was sorry and that he wouldn't do it again. So, with that said...only time will tell, eh?  I just think it's sad...I mean, it's not like he ended up in the room by accident, right?!

       So, the Bob story. Way, way back...in the "way-back" file in my mind is a brief story of a beautiful infatuation/love gone terribly wrong. I met Bob, quite randomly, when I was out for a drink with friends. He was a friend of one of my friends...and we got to talking. Eventually, we started dating. I was happy. He was happy. Weeks flew by. I realized, after awhile, that our sexual activity had slowed down considerably...and this was a problem for me. A big one. I love sex. I want to have sex a lot when I'm in a relationship. I don't like NOT having sex. Anyway, I'd started to peek around...condom wrappers in the bathroom wastebasket...wrappers from condoms WE hadn't used. My mind started whirring like an overworked hard drive. Then I found out, through his friends, that Bob had visited the gay Bath Houses on many occasions...something that did NOT sit well with me...and believe you me: I am NOT a prude. Thus  Bath-House Bob  earned his moniker. The final straw, really, occured one evening when I signed onto my email account. I had become extremely suspicious and sneaky - and had devised a plan to TRAP him in his wandering ways. I created a new screen name and headed into the M4M chat room of the city he was visiting. Within 5 minutes, I had located him...and he had located me on his radar screen. Like a moth to a flame, he cruised me hard...even inviting me to his hotel room for sex. I asked for his hotel phone number "so we could talk a little" dialed the number and heard his voice answer on the other end. I was devastated, of course, but prepared to deal with it because I had, after all, wanted to know. So, thus ended our whirlwind romance. A nosedive into the dirt...smoking wreckage...it was over.

       Someday, remind me to tell you the story of Krabbe (pronounced "Crabby"), and how he came to be known as  Bath-House Bob . Shockingly, similar antics are in play right now in my life.

       I woke up the past two mornings lying next to the gently breathing, warm warm man - sweetened by the naivete only the morning brings. His arms around me - keeping me from moving - from leaving him. The very sweetness of his soul slips forward with every drowsy breath rendered. Sometimes, when he's deep in sleep, his lips smack, and he utters garbled, unintelligible sentences. As if he were at once speaking to me in code, and muttering secrets meant not at all for my ears. When morning blooms and we both stumble ungraciously into consciousness - that is, when realism and reality retaliate - devastate - for all of the stolen romantic moments, we are thrust into a coldness - bright light silvery and gray. There is no warm man here - no comfort, no embrace. Only quick morning ablutions and a swift retreat to school and work. But. In those moments. When it is still. When it is still darkness and quiet. My heart glows - asleep in him, his embrace, but somehow sensing it all the same. Memorizing it.

       Back on Wednesday...October 18, our flight was delayed leaving Cleveland. Not because of anything here, but because of weather in New York. At any rate, the net result was this: our flight arrived at 8:10pm and I missed my show. However, what displaced this disappointing turn of events, was a bit or writing which consumed me on the delay, and eventual, flight over. I will share bits of it here with you.

       So, apparently the hotel where I'll be staying in NYC tomorrow thru Saturday is only rated as 2 diamonds...and my travel agent friend Phil says he would NEVER, I repeat, NEVER send a client to a low-rated property like that. Naturally, I was horrified. So, I looked into it. it doesn't look bad at all. In fact, it looks quite nice! It didn't stop me from putting in a priceline bid, however, somewhere else.

       We had to get up today at 6:45am. This, even in theory or hypothesis, is horrifying to me. We did it, though. Matt needed to get to campus early for one of his exams. He's quite difficult to rouse from slumber, but I was proud of him for actually getting to the car by 7am. I returned and promptly went back to bed until 8:30. So I shoed up at work a little late? Who cares?! I need sleep or else I am a BEAR to deal with!

       I went to lunch with Kelley Marlier - one of my sales reps. We stopped up at CIM to drop off a CD that Matthew needed for his midterms tomorrow. It was kinda fun seeing him in the middle of the day...as opposed to seeing him next to me in bed. Did I say that in my "outside" voice?!?!

       All's well that ends well. I had a really nice afternoon and evening visiting friends and family. In the course of my travels, I realized I had a very important CD that Matt needs for his midterms tomorrow. So, I will be dropping it off at school during my lunch break. We'll see each other today and tomorrow, and then not for a whole week - between my trip to NY and his to Chicago. So far, it's a regular old Monday.

       Well, it has been an interesting weekend. Not in the conventional sort of way...but interesting nonetheless. I retrieved Matthew from campus on Friday evening. We stopped at the grocery store and video store to pick up food and a movie. We ended up making a Boboli pizza and drinking nasty hard cider (so ghetto). We watched "Muriel's Wedding" which I had never seen all the way through. Saturday was set aside for visiting Cedar Point - which was a lot of fun! The weather was delightful and the few rides we actually rode - were great. We came home and rested before going to a party at Heather's...at which time Matt and I  got into a wee disagreement, and I was called "callous" for the second time in 6 days. Troubling. After a while we smoothed out the edges, but I am still concerned. More on this later. This morning, I took him back to school and I have the entire day to myself. I may go visit my sister and nephew - and maybe Grandma. I'll be sure to write more later!

       I am so excited!  urlLink Sade  is one of my favorite singers and she's coming out with a new album this month! The first single, "By Your Side" is fantastic! I can't wait to get the CD in my greedy little hands. It's been eight years since her last release...long overdue!

       I am going to work in the studio tonight with my friend Doug. ..cleaning up more of the work we did last week. I am really looking forward to hearing all the improvements he's made. I guess our friend Joni did a great back-up take on "Missed the Train" that I'm curious to hear. All in all, it's been a terrific day! Not to tease, but I think tomorrow I'll do a new post from the  urlLink EMeRGe  mailbag.

Hopefully, the weather will hold out for us. Keep your fingers crossed. Oh, if you go to the link, you can take a virtual ride of the coaster! It's WAY cool!

       I took a little nap after work today. I think it did me some good. I was awakened by the sound of the telephone chirping...or whatever you call that irritating electronic ringing. Anyway, it was Matt checking in. He offered to get a ride to my house tonight (very sweet) but since I am feeling under the weather, I told him to just stay home tonight. It's weird, tonight is the first time in a week we haven't slept together. Kelly and I are watching "The Way We Were" and she'll probably start crying soon.

       It's weird being in a dating relationship again. I mean weird in a "different" (not BAD) sorta way. I mean, I always think I have everything all figured out, and along comes someone who challenges me in completely different ways. Matt is younger - which doesn't factor into our interactions very often. Sometimes, I find him extremely critical/opinionated about music, films, poetry...well...most everything. Like I said before, he's the kind of guy that makes me want to write poetry...the only problem is...I think he'd be critical of it in the end, so why bother. Isn't that screwed-up?!? Maybe that's just a part of his age + nature of his fine arts training. I don't know. Just sounding off...

       Today, in my hallucinogenic funk, I have been working on the advertising and promotional plans for the National Tour of FAME: The Musical. This has been quite a lot of fun, because the show lends itself to all sorts of odd promotion. Do you remember the TV series from '82-'83? You remember Debbie Allen and Leroy...ooh! and Doris and Bruno...with all that hair. Fame...I wanna live forever...

       Matt and I drove to Philly this past weekend. We left at Noon on Friday and drove straight through to Trish's house. We made great time, arriving just after 7:30pm. Friday night, we went to Dave and Buster's for a late dinner and then returned home to drink wine and to let Matt do a couple of loads of laundry. Saturday, we had breakfast at the Court Diner, lunch with Jen Lomas, Amy and Nick. Then, Trish, Matt and I headed into the city to walk around. Matt had plans to have dinner with his family that night, so Trish and I headed home for dinner at her house. We picked Matt up in the city at 9:45pm and went downtown for a drink at a bar called "Woody's." Sunday, we loafed around until Matt and I had to leave. When we got back to Cleveland, there was almost 2 inches of snow on the ground! Ugh! Welcome home!!

       The faculty recital last night was terrif! Don and Vivian Weilerstein were unbelieveable! What talent! Again, i know almost nothing about classical music, but I really could appreciate the talent and artistry of their performances last night. We all went out afterwards to the Mad Greek Restaurant where we encountered a mad waiter (it was closing time). I had a delightful chat with both Vivian and Don.

       I am so lit on caffeine right now it's totally not even funny the way I keep running around my office taking things off of the wall and putting new ones on I think maybe it has to do with thye triple morning buzz I ordered at Take 5 Coffee this AM which contains 3 shots of espresso and then the cup is filled to the rim with Brim...just kidding, it's filled to the top with Dark Roast coffee and then a dash of Sweet-N-Low is added and it's topped of with some heavy cream to smooth out the rough edges...

       I am going to see/hear a faculty recital this evening with Matt. The parents of his best friend will be performing at Kulas Hall tonight at 8pm. Since these people are his surrogate family...it'll basically be like meeting the family. And me with little to no knowledge of classical music...I guess I'll have to rely on my charm and good looks (don't FAIL me now!)

       Matt and I are looking forward to our upcoming roadtrip to Philly this weekend. The map says the drive (straight-thru) should only take about 7.5 hours to complete. That means, if we leave here at 12 Noon...we could realistically be at Trish's house by 9pm no problem. This trek across Pennsylvania will come in handy as research - so I'll know exactly what it's like to drive to Trish's.

       I am approaching the gleeful END of my marathon laundry day. I have completed over 8 separate loads. Next round: ironing and folding. At least it keeps me busy while waiting to hear from my family (who are apparently MIA) and for Matt to get back to Cleveland. I am looking forward to seeing SEX IN THE CITY...I managed to miss it last week when I was picking Matt up at the airport and driving back down to Aurora. God, was that ONLY a week ago?

       Ahh...glorious Sunday! A day for laundry, housecleaning and other various mundane activities. However, I am determined not to let these tasks get the better of me. The weather is astonishingly beautiful, and a long drive out to the country is in order - that is, AFTER I finish my laundry. Matthew is coming home tonight from Chicago, so I'm very excited to see him again. I do miss him when he's away. I hope this week goes smoothly, and that I can clear all my work tasks out of the Friday window - as Matt and I would like to leave as early as possible for Philadelphia.

Hopefully, I will return from vacation with lots of interesting stories, gossip and scandals!! Keep your fingers crossed...

       Ooooooooooh Honey,  This feels so "ouchy"!  Dad and I both feel so sad for your feelings! You have to be feeling some real shock and of course that emptiness that keeps filling up with sadness.  I am soooooooooooooooooooo sorry honey! You are right when you talk about his continual adoration.  It was so very apparent and so all the more shocking for you to deal with.   God has a plan for you and the perfect person coming your way.   Of this I am totally sure!!!!   You are such an incredibly wonderful spirit and soul!     No matter what though it is a hurtful place to be right now and we are so sad for you.   You know that anytime you are feeling lonely and in the need for company you can come here to get a refill of completely unconditional love.  It is overflowing for you  all the time.  Darling we are with you as you move on.  We always will be.           we love you more than you can ever think or say, mom

       I am always heartened and amazed at the emotional generosity of people. Sometimes it takes a nasty little event (like a break-up) to make you realize the abundance you have in your life. I could never have imagined the random, un-prompted outpouring of love I have received today...a day when I really need it. It's astonishing what the Universe provides when we ask for it. I am grateful, and humbled.

       Well, it looks as though I'm a single man again. Joe got back from Spain...and rather than me launching into the "we need to talk" speech...he did. Which, is really quite surprising given his continual and recent (up to this past Friday) utter adoration. He said he'd done some thinking while in Spain, and thought that maybe we shouldn't be together romantically.  I had thought we had issues surrounding sex -  like not having any   (which certainly is major) but his sudden change of heart was a bit surprising and disappointing. So, I am, indeed, saddened by our break-up, but I realize it is for the best. Sometimes you run into a wall of insurmountable differences. Send me a hug or two, if you think of it. If you experience a sudden change in atmospheric pressure...don't worry...it's just me attempting to re-inflate my self-esteem. LOL  Ah...l'amour...

       Today is one of those days that feels kinda like Sunday, because I had the day off yesterday...making IT feel like Saturday. I did a whole lot of NOTHING today...except go to the gym for a while with Kelly.

I suppose the aches and pains will go away in a few days...

       Tonight is supposedly the most busy night of the year for bars & nightclubs. I have chosen, for the first time in years, to stay in this evening. Given our recent storms, etc...I thought it would be nice just to stay home by myself. Joe is in Spain with Ali, so I find myself blissfully alone. Not that I don't miss him - I do. It's just nice to be by myself right now, doing whatever the hell I want to whenever I want to. If I don't see you, HAPPY THANKSGIVING! Blessings...

       It's funny how a little snow and a nip in the air can make you feel completely different. As if we went from late fall into "The Holidays" in a single moment. All of a sudden: there it is. The snow is falling here...a little more lazily than yesterday, and people are already scurrying to get home. Today is one of those really odd days, in the sense that everything feels a little off-kilter. Not bad, necessarily, but different...kind of like those Saturdays that feel like Sundays.

       What a trip! Last night's holiday lighting thingy was a scream! We did the ceremony amidst a complete white-out blizzard. I felt like Jack Nicholson at the end of THE SHINING. Afterwards (because traffic was so snarled) a bunch of us went out drinking at Becky's (famous hole-in-the-wall bar). Wheeee! By the time we headed home, traffic had returned to normal..despite the 8 inches of snow that had fallen.

Mind you...any mention of cute guys may send the author's boyfriend into a jealous tizzy, but it's a risk I am willing to take...since he's my very own "Joey"...his name is actually Joe...not Matt...I just did that to protect his anonynonynonynonyminity....uh....privacy. Anyhow...the secret is out. This is him:  urlLink Joe . Isn't he cute? Kinda Carson Daly-ish, doncha think? Anyhow.....bring 'em on!!!

       Several things: I just received a wonderful goody-package from my friend at JIVE Records. Included are several new Backstreet Boys CDs (yes, the new release) and a couple copies of the JIVE "Platinum Christmas" album...featuring Britney, Christina, NSYNC, Santana, Dido, TLC and Miss Whitney. Sounds like freakin' unbelieveable smattering of holiday happiness. Also: an EMeRGe welcome to Erika from somewheres around VEGAS!! (Hey, I said VEGAS, people! Let's get up and show some respect for Erika and her peeps!) Anyhoo...she reminded me that the very first story on this website is the most popular one...How I got cruised by NSYNC...and that if YOU are interested in reading it, go to the archives and click on August. It's the VERY FIRST entry ever posted. Read it...it's a HOOT and it's absolutely 100% true...you can ask my friend  urlLink Trish . She'll verify!

       Okay, so I missed a day yesterday. The problem here is this: our internet connection completely and totally sucks! Yes, we have a T1 line...but for some inexplicable reason, our system gets REALLY bogged-down & then Blogger doesn't want to work...what's a girl to do??  Did anyone else hear the NPR review of THE GRINCH today? Yikes! It totally slaughtered the new Jim Carrey flick. Not really surprising...he's a hack!

       From  Uncle John's Bathroom Reader : As if it's not bad enough to have a ghost haunting your office, a computer factory in England, built on the site of a 19th century chapel, is reportedly inhabited by a ghost that farts. Workers think it might be the embarrassed spirit of a girl who farted while singing in church. "On several occasions," said an employee, "there has been a faint girlish voice singing faint hymns, followed by a loud raspberry sound and then a deathly hush."

       Well...we flew to Philly on Friday morning...we both had flights at 7:40am (alas, not on the same carrier) arriving somewhere around 9am. Trish picked us up and we went to breakfast. Later in the day, we checked in at the Wyndham - wow! nice digs!! Friday night, Matt went to the opera while Trish and I went to Bon Jovi...slightly different, no? Saturday, we walked all around the city and then met Trish for a fashinable late lunch. Later, we met Trish and Kelly for dinner at Orfeo near Rittenhouse Square. Delicious! Sunday, we tried to get Matt back to Cleveland by flying standby, but priceline.com and the airlines don't look too favorably on that - so he was stuck. We returned Monday on separate flights. That's the skeletal breakdown of our weekend. In all, it was great spending time in the city - and great seeing Trish. More later.

       So, backing up...the road trip to Utica was really nice! Matt and I left Cleveland at 12:30pm and drove across PA and NY to Utica. We arrived at 6:15...a mere five hours and forty-five minutes after our departure. This is great considering the Mapquest people said it would take over 7 hours. I guess they don't count on driving at 80 to 85mph. We arrived and checked in at our luxurious Red Roof Inn, and then drove to Ali and Vivian's apartment. We had a nice dinner and then hung out for awhile. On Sunday, we had lunch and then headed over to the concert venue. After a wonderful afternoon, we headed back out on the road to Cleveland. Only, this time, it took only five and a half hours...Needless to say, I was exhausted the next day.

But, we'll be renting a movie and hanging out later tonight anyway. Any suggestions on some good scary movies? We've been on a nasty little jag of seeing BAD BAD scary movies recently. Last night, we took in (or should I say WE were taken to the cleaners) when we saw  urlLink Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows . What?! Book of Shadows? There was no book in this movie!! There were no shadows! It's just a crazy DUMB flick. DON'T BOTHER. If you felt taken by the first one...this one will make you feel doubly idiotic if you spend cash money to see it.

       Blogging is a great way to express yourself while honing your writing, journaling and creative talents. I was talking to a friend about blogging, and she was wary of having it out on the internet for anyone to see. I guess, but you always have the choice to share or not to share. You always have the ability to post creative writing or actual facts. Also, there's no law saying you have to use real names. So, get blogging everyone...I'm sure you must have  something  to say!

But Britney's record company, Jive, says it is highly unlikely the teen star will follow idol, Madonna's footsteps and become a mum in the near future. A spokesperson said, "I would not put any money on it." Oh - imagine a mini Justin 'n' Britney running around...on seconds thoughts, don't, it could ruin your new year!

        Good Morning Darling,  I haven't called or written anything and the week is escaping quickly. I have to take a moment to try to put into words how thankful, grateful and blessed both Dad and I have felt a million times over this week for your wonderful hand in our lives.  The Christmas tree stands in the corner looking absolutely beautiful and reminds us of the  time and the talent you shared with us last Sunday.   The tree is beautiful and your involvement with its selection, and ultimate completion made everything work smoothly for your Dad and me.   We really have been on a very fast track these past few weeks and as you know an emotional roller coaster for much longer than that.  Having that tree all done, and done SO beautifully has given us a lift honey that is almost spiritual!    You came in and filled a VERY big need that even we didn't know for sure that we had.  We continue to run faster and faster through each day. Most of the time barley having time to do anything but the most necessary things  for ourselves but every now and then we spy the tree and are beautifully reminded of your easy, loving manner and gifts.  All I can say in words is "Thank You"   however  in my heart is this huge, never ending  love and joy that God sent you to us.   When I think of Christmas and all the meaning that it has for me and all the love that the world is enfolded in I think of you.   You live, and share  God's Love every moment of your life  and we are blessed!!!!    We love you!                                                    mom and dad

Last night, we are presented with our 4th (and hopefully final) Carney: David Kammerman. This is a stroke of genius, as David is an incredibly talented actor...we are really lucky to have him! My evening with Jennie was great. I mototred out to her parents' home in the middle of nowhere. It took less that 15 seconds to be transported right back to High School...we became these terrifying recreations of our 16 year-old selves...it was immensely fun!

       As is always the case, it ain't over until it's over...I pondered long and hard whether I was even going to mention this in my blog, but I think honesty is the key issue that propels this one forward. Anyway, I get home yesterday and there's a postcard sitting on my kitchen counter. Upon closer inspection, I see that it's from Barcelona...that's it's from Joe. Of course I am thinking  What the HELL is he doing?!?!  but then I look at the postmark and the content of the postcard and realize it was written during his first trip, before he started scrogging the new guy, but mailed WAY after he returned to the USA. So, it would seem someone mailed it FOR him. Anyway, that's enough time spent on that...but the point is: they  always  come back in some way...emails, letters, phone calls or postcards...it's never truly over in their minds.  OK, so I'm done with that subject.

       What do Ricky Martin and George Michael have in common?                Oh giggle. Besides that.   We'll give you a wee hint. It has to do with Michael's beau, Kenny Goss, and his penchant for the sweet juice that can only come from exotic tropical island berries of the spicy Puerto Rican variety.   Rumors about our favorite Martin have taken flight once again, following news that Michael's oft stepped-out-upon better half might have shared more than just a passing regard for the loose-hipped singing sensation.     Like the vote in Florida, we may never know beyond all reasonable certainty, but like the vote in Florida -- well, we got eyes don't we?   Seems the Martin and Goss used to hang together on a semi-regular basis but, after a few turns round the garden, went their separate ways. "I saw Ricky a few times and we had a great time - but it all ended very suddenly," Kenny told WENN not long ago. "I started seeing George soon after."   Please note, ladies and gentlemen, the usage of "see" in Mr. Goss' remarks.   Ricky maintains the friendship was just and only that, and sporting yet another new and interesting hairstyle, denied yet again that he is a gay homosexual person.

       This weekend was just a little over-the-top as far as my schedule was concerned. Suffice it to say, I did a lot of stuff...as did everyone else, I'm sure during this busy holiday period. One of the nicest moments was spent last evening at my parent's home in Aurora. My grandmother, who is 93 years old, and I unwrapped all of the Christmas ornaments for the tree while my parents were attending a holiday dinner party. It was such a treat to spend the time with her reminiscing as we inspected each ornament...some new and some very, very old. Something like that - something so simple - is all it took to get me into the holiday spirit.

       Some more lyrics hit me over the head last night. I guess it's time to get writing more songs. I'm due. Songs are really great because it's this perfect little capsule where you get to say/emote everything you want to. Good morning, by the way...I'm enjoying a nice steamy Chai latte. The weather here is decidedly Christmassy, with over 6 inches of snow on the ground, and most of it powdery white - except for where the dogs have been.

       I remember the ramp-up into the Christmas season a few years ago when I was a sophomore at Ohio State. My best friend, Michelle, and I were staying later than usual to finish up a very large and very difficult project for our course in Rhetoric (213, I believe). We both had single dorm rooms in adjacent buildings. The bustle and clamor had died down as my fellow students and friends headed home for the holidays. I distinctly remember never feeling more alone. It reminded me of the flashback sequence in Dickens' A CHRISTMAS CAROL where Ebeneezer Scrooge sees himself alone at school. I was in my room, room 226, in Park Hall typing my paper on my freakishly outdated Apple IIc. Tapping my way into mental numbness...I purged all my research and opinions on the subject of "The Rhetoric of Western Thought," all the while listening to Roger Whittaker and Dolly Parton, alternately, croon away on my favorite Time-Life Christmas Treasury CD. As far as details are concerned, that's really all I remember...the rest is vague and foggy. But the feeling is something I will never forget.  Lonely and desolate, forging ahead, immersing myself in my research, trying not to think about my family and friends already miles ahead of me, literally and figuratively. As Robert Frost said, I still had "miles to go" before I could rest. Eventually, we both finished our projects, walked across the empty campus and delivered them to our Professor's office.  The next Christmas, Michelle and I were living in an apartment off-campus. The Quarter was usually finished by December 9th or so, and I had decided to stay until later in the month, working to earn a few extra dollars. I remember not having very much money for gifts that year, so I wrote a short story and had it printed and bound nicely at Kinko's. It captured, I felt, the spirit of the season and made a very meaningful gift. It was in that time between December 9th and 24th where I again felt that difficult loneliness. I remember being amazed at the quiet, the stillness...and bewildered at the same time...that a place once so busy with students and staff could become so desolate and empty. And there I was, in the middle of it, walking High Street looking for other people. Feeling the strangest sensation, like I didn't belong. Like I was the last guest at a party I wasn't even invited to attend. In those moments, I turned to my writing. Whether an assignment or project of love, writing helped me through some dark, desolate stretches of time and mind. The story I wrote? It was titled "A Place Called Home," a simple reflection of someone lonely for family, friends and tradition during this special season. No matter what shape or form or place "home" is to you, may you find peace and love there, this, and every day...

       What could Ricky Martin, Robert Downey Jr. and David Blaine possibly have in common? If you said they've all snorted cocaine with Leonardo DiCaprio, you're probably at least more than half right... But we were thinking something more along the lines of "Persistent Problems with Celebrity."   Take, for instance, Cindy Crawford. Not on our list, and rapidly being crossed off many others. Precisely our point.   Until this weekend, Cindy was Revlon's wonder woman on top of her craft: happily swinging her luxurious hair around rotating, advancing and retreating multi-colored lipsticks and moisturizing waterfalls, and -- well, now look. One pink slip sayonara later and she's a former model rapidly advancing on a certain age. I mean, it's not as if she can fall back on her acting career, now is it?     Ricky Martin has a little problem, with all of you. He gets more than "un poco" snippy with you know who, telling People magazine he "can't get hung up on people" whose sad little lives are "so empty" they feel compelled to treat the names, dates, specs, locales and props that make up the living tapestry of his sexual orientation (She Bangs!) as idle gossip. But he adds magnanimously, "you can fantasize about me however you want."   As if.   Downey obviously has a slight problem: chief among them being that someone who travels pretty closely with him has put a major snitching tail on his ass. How else to explain that the man can't so much as check himself into a hotel room without having the cops bust down the door?   Where's that dried up crusading consumer advocate when you really need him? Don't "Do Not Disturb" signs mean anything any more?   And in what we can only interpret as a public love letter symbolizing their long estrangement and "frozen" relations (with perhaps a nod to the on-screen fate his friend suffered at the hands of that maniac James Cameron in the North Atlantic) David Blaine is reaching out to Leonardo DiCaprio, aka Heavy D, the only way he knows how -- freezing himself into a six ton block of ice in Times Square for two and a half days.   If it doesn't kill him, it'd might just be the sweetest thing he's ever done.

       Good morning! Well, back to some of that random pop phenomenon...apparently there is more boyband sniping going on. It seems to me they'd be better off if they quit fighting and started dating each other. I don't know...what do you think? Heavyweight Boy Band Wars Rage On *NOTE* I do not endorse the whole BSB vs *NSYNC thing - this is just a report I found and thought some people might find it interesting. As Justin said "Don't get your panties in a wad" over it :) (12/10) from : Two members of the BACKSTREET BOYS, Kevin Richardson and Nick Carter, have made a verbal attack against 'Nsync.       The boys claim in the latest issue of Live And Kicking magazine that their band have had to do all the grafting, whilst their rivals have just followed their lead.       They are also bitter that their management company created Nsync while the Backstreet Boys were on a world tour.       Nick raged, I think if there wasnt a Backstreet Boys there wouldnt have been an Nsync. No one has any idea how hard we had to work in Europe to make it.       Kevin added, We dont have anything against them personally but it is annoying to me how they came to be.       Our management company created Nsync in our image once we were successful.       He continued, They went to all the same producers, on all the same tours and met all the same people. In the end it was like all the doors we kicked open, they just walked through.       Certainly Nsync have been successful  picking up four US Billboard awards earlier this week. Their No Strings Attached album also shifted 2.4 million copies in its first week of release, a record for the fastest selling album.

       I had a great night at rehearsal for BILOXI BLUES last night. We ran the first act over and over...these guys are really talented...and a scream! I'm really enjoying myself - being in a completely new and different sphere of people. The guys in the show are fun, funny, interesting and always entertaining. Life does spin on a dime, this opportunity to work with my favorite director was certainly a well-timed blessing. Theatre is always therapy for me...and in just a few days it seems my world has completely turned around. I think that's totally cool!

       Almost made you love me. Almost made you cry. Almost made you happy, baby, Didn't I? Didn't I? You almost had me thinkin' you were turned around, but everybody knows Almost doesn't count. Almost heard you sayin' you were finally free. What was always missing for you, baby...you'd found it in me. But you can't get to Heaven half off the ground. Everybody knows Almost doesn't count. I can't keep on lovin' you one foot outside the door. I hear a funny hesitation of a heart that's never really sure. Can't keep on trying if you're looking for more than all that I could give you, than what you came here for. Gonna find somebody not afraid to let go. Want a no doubt be there kind of man. You came real close. But every time you built me up, you only let me down. And, everybody knows...Almost doesn't count. Maybe you'll be sorry. Maybe you'll be cold. Maybe you'll come running back, baby, from the cruel, cruel world. Almost convince me you're gonna stick around. But everybody knows, Almost doesn't count. So maybe I'll be here. Maybe I'll see you around. That's the way it goes. Almost doesn't count. (S. Peiken/G. Roche)

       Last night was boys night out. I went out for a drink after rehearsal with Jeffrey, Andrew and Elliot. I have to say, hanging out with a bunch of straight men can be extremely amusing! I got to observe Jeffrey and Andrew cruise and flirt with our server, Audrey, who was really walking the fine line between classy and trashy. I still haven't made up my mind. To their dismay, she spent a lot of time flirting with me. By the end of the night, and after I had left, Andrew ended up scoring her number. Boys...

       The concert in Oberlin was incredible. An evening filled with amazing musical artistry. It was odd to be at a classical event with a different set of people. Until Joe, I had very infrequently participated in classical music events. So, there I was surrounded by this wonderful music, and I am reminded of him...and how he's back in Spain with his new lover, Miguel...and when the shame-spiral stopped...I realized I was okay, and there were plenty of hotties to scope at such an event. So, I did what any other man in my position would do, I got busy scoping...both the tenor and bass soloists were mighty fine, as were many members of the audience. By concert's end, I was alive with possibilities...having been reminded that life is full of opportunities. I have only just begun...

       Friday's opening went extremely well, even though the audience seemed dead. Yesterday, I visited with Doug and we worked on a few songs. I helped re-write one of his called "I'll Never Leave You" which I morphed into "Don't Want You (To Love Me This Way)" Last night's show was sold-out to a very enthusiastic crowd. I went to church this AM, and then attended the annual Christmas DInner...you can never get enough turkey dinner between Thanksgiving and New Years. Going to hang out with neighbor Dave until I have to go to Margaret's concert tonight at 8pm in Oberlin. Bye for now...

       Oh yeah...I forgot to mention: all of us in "C Company" in BILOXI have to do a shitload of real-time actual Army-type push-ups. So, I have begun a new regimen I will call "Boot Camp" (wish it was Booty Camp...but that's another story) where I am doing push-ups, sit-ups and jogging to prep me for the role. Today's efforts, while valiant, were meager...so I won't reveal how few push-ups I did before I quit. However, tonight and tomorrow AM I will try to improve upon that number. Eventually, I need to be doing 100 in a single session. Yikes!

       I had my first BILOXI BLUES rehearsal last night. It looks like it's a fairly talented cast...a great group of guys! I love the play, it's one of Neil Simon's funniest, and still poignant. I seem destined to play accessible gay characters...which is A-OK with me! Hennesey is the last person you'd suspect to be gay...but then gets busted and tossed out of the Army...never to be heard from again. Cool, huh?

       I was telling Trish that I always encounter a certain sense of melancholy when I'm in the Baltimore airport. It stems back to a very wonderful/horrible period I went through with Lee as we were breaking-up. I visited his new home on a few occasions in Baltimore, and coming & going through that airport always brings back a tidal wave of old crap...okay, it's not really a tidal wave anymore...but I am always cognizant of it. The melancholy that creeps around corners and sidles up next to you when I'm there. And, I'm always there by myself, it seems. I both love it and hate it. I am always curiously drawn to it...as if I'll find some new information...or answers this time.

My flight arrived on time & I chatted with my mother via cell phone while I waited for my ride. When they arrived, I hopped in and we set off for Williamsburg. I really had no idea what to expect. We spent five days exploring, eating, sightseeing, eating, shopping and eating our way through the town. Amazing! I would totally recommend it to anyone interested in history (or eating)!

However, some of you may recall how dead-on my intuition is...that's the only thing that worries me. In the end, it's a terrific play, and hopefully that will carry us.  Dubious

       Yesterday, driving to work was absolute treachery...black ice everywhere! For the uninitiated, black ice is a very thin layer that forms on roads, bridges and any other imaginable surface, and it always wreaks havoc to both drivers and pedestrians. So, imagine my amusement when I am approaching an intersection and I see a Police "Traffic Control" vehicle slide right through the red light while spinning counter-clockwise! Now  that's  what I call traffic control! Today, it was almost 50 degrees Farenheit...balmy! Spring-like! Almost...delightful. A little reprieve in the dark, dark, darkness of winter.

       I was driving away from rehearsal tonight and I was overcome by depression. I missed being with my friends from  Biloxi Blues  and I missed the fun of being together, rehearsing the show, going out, etc. So, there I was driving the same streets, to and from the same theatre, and I was really bummed. It just doesn't seem like  Getting Away With Murder  is going to be very good...and certainly nowhere near the incredible production of  Biloxi . So, it's hard to keep a stiff upper lip. The fact is, I don't really like many of the people involved in the new show and I fear they are talent-free (for the most part). And, trust me, I am aware that I sound like a giant diva, but I want the projects I work on to be good -  very  good. Otherwise, why waste my time? So, I started thinking...I need to find ways to make this a positive experience. I'll jot them down in the blog just as soon as I've thought of them. Should I just quit? Does that make me sound/look like a complete asshole? Should I just suck it up & deal?? Feel free to  urlLink register  your opinion.

       Tonight I go back to  Getting Away With Murder  rehearsal. I hope to have a better grasp of the abilities of the cast. I am concerned, thus far, to say the least. Upon our first read-thru, it appears we have a few illiterate boobs who may be completely void of any acting talent whatsoever...especially since Elliot Hooper (from  Biloxi ) had to drop out. I am  deathly  worried about the quality of the show.

       I guess it has been a few days. The whirlwind week finally wrapped-up, and I was free to do a few of the things that I like to do..sleep and party.  BILOXI  was a knockout this weekend with fantastic audiences and great performances by everyone in the company. Friday night saw most of the cast and crew go out immediately following the show. Some of us stayed out until 3 AM or so...I'm not saying  who ...Saturday was just as much fun & a ton of friends, family and neighbors caught the show. I spent Sunday visiting with my friend Margaret and watching silly movies and reading. All in all, an excellent end to a frightful week. So far, this week looks like an absolute delight in comparison!

Ugh. However, the good things do outnumber the bad today, so it isn't a  total  wash. I have been pitching stories to the media about  LIDO  for weeks and it seems they've finally bitten. I scored 5 radio appearances and one television booking for tomorrow and Friday...and it all happened today...in the midst of my little universe exploding.  It's all good ...

       Andrew and I finally had the chance to catch-up last night. In true old-school OSU style, we chatted into the wee hours of my morning...he's an hour behind. Anyway, it was good to splatter each other with the varied detritus from the past 4 or 5 years of our lives. I am fairly convinced to just sell the house and move to Chicago. What I'll do is another story...but I'll figure it out eventually. Anyone wanna buy a house?

       You know, I really haven't had the chance to explain how incredible it is to be "found" by an old friend. I haven't done the story justice, but I promise to give it a whirl. It's a difficult task trying to describe  urlLink Andrew ...for me, it is tough coming up with the right superlative, because in his steady, decent, honest, strong, vulnerable, playful, loving and whimsical way, Andrew gave me faith in Hetero-Mankind. Yes, he was the  first .  Here was this sweet and sexy guy willing to be in my insipid and melodramatic (albeit quite honest) one-act play, in which he was to kiss another guy... me . He wasn't the first actor I had asked to play the part. I had offered the role to five other gay men...thinking they'd  love  the opportunity to kiss one of OSU's hottest and most eligible gay bachelors...right?  Wrong . Call it internalized homophobia, or fear they might forever be typecast as gay (oh puh-leeeeze, girls!) they all said no. So, I was called on to do something I didn't want to do...put a friend in an awkward position...asking this straight guy to lay one on me. And he did. He stepped right up to the plate and did it. I don't think he even blinked when I asked. He had already managed to say yes as I was ramping up to tell him I understood how he didn't want to do...YES?!?! Did you say YES??  Andrew is one of the people in my life whom I connected with immediately. It was something unspoken, but visceral. I don't think I ever told him how much he meant to me...I don't think I had the words, even then. The play,  Winter Wheat , was a stunning triumph for the cast, they made me very proud...proud because they told a true story...and it touched the audience...complete strangers...Andrew was one of them, the bravest, perhaps. He was a role-model for me, in ways...he was willing to kiss another man on stage in front of an audience...something I wasn't sure I was ready to do. Andrew made it okay. He made me fearless. To me, he was a hero, he embodied my hope for an understanding, inclusive and loving generation, a young hetero man willing to take a chance at a time when it wasn't so cool to play gay.  I am here to tell you that Andrew did it first...before "The Object of My Affection," "In & Out," and "Will & Grace," there was Andrew...talented and lovely in all the best ways. If I have never told you before...I love you, my friend.

       I have been watching portions of the Inaugural festivities all day. I think I was most touched by President Clinton's farewell at Andrews Air Force Base. I'm gonna miss him...I hope the next 4 years aren't, well,  boring ...

       Finally. We opened  BILOXI BLUES  last night to an extremely enthusiastic crowd. The show went off without a hitch, and the audience responded vociferously. Just wanted to let you know that all went extremely well (on that front).

       Found via Blogger: one long lost friend! I haven't been in touch with Andrew for a long time. We met each other at Ohio State, and I think he's one of the best guys around! He managed to accidentally find me while making changes to his own blog. How freaky is  that ? Reunited by Blogger...who'da thunk it??

       I keep having this overwhelming sense of doom that the rolling blackouts in California will somehow disable  urlLink Blogger . Egads! What would we all do? So, in an event of a power-outage in  urlLink San Francisco , I have made a list of alternate activities for stranded Bloggers: 1. clip fingernails. 2. clean lint and other detritus from mouse roller-ball. 3. dust your monitor and cpu. 4. try channeling Bill Gates. 5. read something other than a monitor. 6. practice telekinesis (moving stuff with sheer mental power). This is just a simple list to help get you started. No doubt, you'll come up with more. Now, just  who  thought it was a good idea to have all the servers located in California? Omaha looks good right about now...

       Have I told you about being onstage in my underwear yet? In the production of  BILOXI BLUES , which opens this Friday at the  urlLink Chagrin Valley Little Theatre , me and the other guys get to spend a considerable amount of stage time in our boxer shorts. This would be okay during a more moderate, temperate weather season...but, since we run for four weeks in the dead of winter...we all are freezing our butts off. I can tell you there's nothing like parading around onstage in your skivvies...especially when you've got goosebumps all over. Pretty.  Very  pretty.

Thankfully, everything was returned in it's original lackluster condition. Hoo-HA!

       From  Internet Studies: Weblogging 101  For those of you who may be new to weblogging...or "blogging" as we call it, here are a few tips which will help you not look and sound  completely  silly when discussing the topic: The term " blog " comes from web+log = weblog, minus the prefix "we" = blog. Got it?!  A weblog is posted to the website in reverse chronological order, with the most recent posting on top. SO, if something is not immediately clear...read on...most likely all of your questions will have been answered in earlier posts. Blogging is just like journaling. We bloggers jot down random thoughts, opinions, poems and other mental detritus as it occurs to us. Thus, the writing may, at times, seem disjointed...random...and/or insane. This is normal. This is called "creative writing." Try it sometime, you may like it.  Yes , we bloggers are, in fact, aware that our writings are  immediately accessible  to readers  worldwide . No, this does not bother us. If sharing something personal makes me uncomfortable, then I don't share it. So, anything I post is usually a topic I'd have no problem discussing openly with you, or my own mother. Blogging is increasing in popularity daily. When I started in August, there were merely 20,000 of us using Blogger. Now, there are well over 90,000 folks all over the globe doing this. We've (as a community) received press and praise from major news organizations including, but not limited to,  The New York Times, The Washington Post  and  The Times of London ...not to mention,  The National Enquirer . So, hopefully, this answers a few questions. As always, feel free to email me using the link on the front page of my site, or click  urlLink here .

       Good morning! The all-day technical hell I was expecting (yesterday) was really quite fluid and even enjoyable. It looks like the show is right on track to a spectacular opening, I'm talking, of course, about  BILOXI BLUES , which opens Friday. Here it is Monday, and I have so much stuff to do to prepare for the opening of  FAME  tomorrow night at the Palace Theatre. So far, sales are fab...

       I just got back from a gala benefit performance of   The Snowman   which is based on the wonderful children's book of the same name. This is the same production I saw back at the tail-end of November & loved. THey've made a few changes/additions & the show is as magical and moving as ever. My friend Phil helped with the benefit today and, as usual, did a spectacular job! I am always so moved by his talents and generosity...it's inspiring. After the show, Phil and I went out to dinner with our friend Jill and her friend Marcie (sp?). I had a blast spending time with them & getting to catch-up with Jill was a special treat.  Tomorrow, I head into technical rehearsals for BILOXI from 1pm til whenever...we'll probably run the whole show twice. Wish me luck!

       I apologize for being remiss in posting today. It's been extremely busy here at work, and I haven't had a moment to spare. The big news in Cleveland this day is that  Sea World  has been SOLD to Six Flags. It's kinda sad for me, I spent 6 of the best summers working there as a narrator for the animal exhibits. I can't imagine our lil metropolis without it. Apparently, Six Flags will still operate the park as a marine park, but it will now be combined with their adjacent amusement park property.

       Not to be too "teen girly" on you, but did you happen to catch Larry King Live (or re-run later) on CNN yesterday? The men of *NSYNC looked dreamy...:::swoooon:::not that they managed to answer any questions very thoughtfully, or with much style and/or panache, but they were delightfully charming. Joey still insists he has this "girlfriend" who splits time between Orlando and LA. Hmmmm...yeah, I have a girlfriend, too... "girlfriend...things that make you go hmmm..."  Chris sounded like the hysterical little freakshow that he is, and JC looked like a porcupine with a soul patch. I will say that Lance looked the best of all of 'em.

       Todd doesn't do well in the early morning. I was called into a marketing/sales committee meeting of our Board of Directors. Typically, this involves arriving somewhere near pre-banking hours, noshing on generic bagels and sipping either too-hot or too-cool Maxwell House coffee from an industrial-sized brewing device. Invariably, someone will ask a question that will induce healthy eye-rolling on my part. I was not disappointed this morning.

       Woohoo! We've surpassed our goal, folks! The Blogger Server Fund (PayPal + CafePress + checks) is now at an astonishing $10,622.71. This is more than we ever imagined this effort would result in. I think it's safe to say we have the finest group of users on the web. Thank you, thank you, thank you! We ordered two more servers last night, and we're still working on fully integrating the other one. So, while things have improved vastly already (and you can thank pb for the code optimizations), they're hopefully going to get better still. Plus, we're going to try to add some exciting new features to the site, and we'll be able to handle the rapid growth that helps us succeed for some time to come. For those who have written that they haven't had a chance to contribute yet, but want to, feel free. We'll keep the fund open. (We can always spend more money on servers. And every penny we do makes Blogger better.) But don't feel you have to. Thanks, again. (BTW, we'll start sending stickers as soon as possible. However, since more people contributed than we ever imagined, we're going to have to order more before we can get them out to everybody. Thank you for your [continued!] patience.)

I must have a meet and greet pass!

Have some decency people please! but then i come across a  snippet of how a fan got cruised by joey. i was clicking faster than a 13  year old boy in Cindy Margolis.com. that brought me to our site and i must  admit i was laughing out loud at some points. you are realy funny and make  every day crap seem interesting, ya just got a new reader!   urlLink Erika   erikacane@yahoo.com  p.s.- where do you work! it sounds like you have the phattest job in the  world!

       Let's see...can I remember all the way back to Friday? I left work Friday evening with a bad headache. I popped pills. I was better. I decided to hang around the house to act as moral and fashion support for Kelly, who was getting ready for Date #2 with Cameron. He arrived at the house at 8:00, and the three of us enjoyed some wine and mild conversation...that boy is no big talker, but definitely sweet. At one point, Kelly had to take a telephone call from her friend Cindy in Japan. That gave good 'ol Cam and me a chance to chatter. I don't remember anything specific...which, I guess, is specific enough. Anyway, after they hit the road, I invited Kim and Heather (friends from work) to come and party with me at my house. After all, it was cleaned immaculately and I had so many candles going you would have thought VH1 was taping  Behind the Music . We had a great evening telling stories, drinking and listening to crazy old tunes by Doris Day and Billie Holiday. Cam and Kel arrived home while my little impromptu party was raging. They went upstairs. The next day, I had to peel myself out of bed at 9:30 to get down to Mansfield, Ohio for a funeral of a family friend. The whole town is so depressing: gray and quiet and plunked down in the middle of nowhere. After returning to Cleveland, I went to see my friend's production of  Pippin  which was quite remarkable! Sunday morning, Kelly and I went to the Clifton Diner...no cutie to be found! DAMN! The food was fantastic, as usual. I spent the rest of the day doing laundry and studying my lines, which I am happy to report: I know!!  Last night, we went over to DVDave's to watch  Queer As Folk ...where I ran into this total beauty named Adam... swoon ...

       Lots of activity this weekend. Tonight, Miss Kelly goes on another date with  Cameron . I am excited for her, because he's bright, sweet, successful and a total hottie. Kelly's gonna get some sugar...for  sure ! I could meet Phil, Maryanne and Jim at the Winking Lizard, or I could just stay home and drink beer. Tomorrow, I might be traveling down to Mansfield for the memorial service of a family friend. She was 93. Tomorrow night, I am going to go see my friend's production of  Pippin . Sunday, I think I have off...a whole day to myself. Maybe I'll finally get all my lines learned. Do you have any fun plans for the weekend? Drop me a  urlLink line .

Well, after being only mildly dumbfounded...and not even a wink blown-away, I carefully crafted a very polite/sweet response, thus exonerating me from any potential perceived nastiness and/or leftover bitterness. They always resurface, don't they? Oh, and by the way, we're  NOT  going to be getting together sometime soon...

       Last night, on my way to rehearsal, I listened to an  old  tape I found in a box in my basement. It was one of the first cassette tapes I ever owned as a child, it was a recording of  The Muppet Movie  soundtrack. So, there I was, barrelling down the highway at 80mph, singing "Movin' Right Along" with Fozzie and Kermit and "Can You Picture That?" with that groovy rock band who's name I don't recall, but it had members named Floyd, and of course, Animal. This makes me want to go rent the DVD and watch it over. Most surprising was my reaction to Gonzo singing "I'm Going to Go Back There Someday," which made me burst into tears...I'm not sure why. Hmm...I wonder if they released that on CD...I should check & then add it to my wish list.

       Okay, I didn't learn it last night, so  today's  mission is to learn Act Two. Picture this: a tense afternoon meeting...tons of suits crowded around a conference table grumbling at each other...Todd, in the corner, muttering lines to Act Two...hoping no one notices...

       Just checking in from out at the Stuart Homestead in lovely rural Portage County. Kelly and I went to the Clifton Diner this morning/afternoon for breakfast/lunch. We ran into a ton of people we knew...including the notorious Jason Romer. Also spotted: a major flirtatious cutie...no, I didn't get his name. Maybe next week...

       About ten of us from work went out last night. We went to a really fun local dive called The Patio. Then, someone thought it would be a good idea to go dancing at Europa. So, in a caravan of random vehicles, we made our way to Europa. We had been in the club for no more than five minutes when the SWAT team showed up and busted down the entire club. Perhaps the most frightening aspect was that they turned the lights on in the club...never a pretty sight. We were told to stand up against the bar...or face down on the dance floor. We waited while everyone was frisked, and in my case, frisked twice. They were looking for drugs and underage drinking, I think. In the end, everyone in our party made it out okay. In happier news, Kelly had a terrific first date with Cameron.

       Just got back from a meeting to discuss a brand-new musical we're producing with Dodger Theatricals. It's called  The Magician  right now, but it's going to workshop here in Cleveland this summer, and then move to Broadway. What a cool concept! Using the illusions of Harry Blackstone, Ivan Menchell has weaved a wonderful romantic comedy. Apparently, the show will rehearse and open in our Ohio Theatre for a four week run. Then, it will transfer to the Great White Way in October.

       I've decided that the next phase of my career will involve moving to Puerto Rico. Strategically, I think this will enhance my life...I will hang out on the beaches for sunrise and sunset...I will cease worrying about the cost of heating my house. I will suddenly become more attractive to friends and family members. And heck, it's easy to get there...what with it being a US Territory and all. Just think how  wonderful  it would be! I have visited the island 5 or 6 times and  loved  it. Must start brainstorming....

       Again, general weirdness on the former set of  Biloxi  last night. As the new set gets built over the remains of the old one, it just keeps reminding me about that show.Okay, I'll quit harping about it...it's just weird, okay? My friend Jen wants me to come visit her in the UK this weekend. So, I am going to go check fares...just to humor her. Be back later...

       You know what was weird? Being on the set of my new show for the first time last night, and seeing the remnants of the  Biloxi  set...the paint marks, the spots on the floor where the bunks were...it was really strange...rehearsing the new show where the old one once stood. I had a decent rehearsal for  Getting Away ...not that everything's all peachy-keen...but definitely better than before.

       Saying goodbye to  Biloxi Blues  was really difficult. I hadn't imagined that would be the case when rehearsals began in early December, when a group of relative strangers all sat down to read through the script for the first time. Now, ten weeks later, I look back at the amazing journey that brought our entire company together. Every single one of us was entirely committed to making the show terrific...funny, poignant and seamless. A machine that required the utmost concentration and dedication of everyone involved...creative staff, front-of-house people, the tech. crew and the volunteer actors. I have never been so inspired, nor so richly rewarded by any other theatrical project. While I am sad it's over, I acknowledge the powerful effect both the process and the people had on my life.

       Tricia is here visiting from Philly...and we've been having a great time! She's come to both performances of  Biloxi Blues  this weekend...and was there for our closing. It really was bittersweet saying goodbye to the show, the staff and the cast...best buncha guys I've worked with in a very long time! I know that I've managed to forge some friendships that I think will last a lifetime. On the other side,  Getting Away With Murder  still is driving me batty. I may have to bail-out this week.

       I had a terrific night last night! Doug and I churned out another song! Using my lyrics (posted here Jan. 31), we sat down and created the music & melody to " sorry " It's got this cool jazz-funk-West African thing going on...at least, the initial takes did. We'll spend the next week tracking it, and then I'll do a final vocal. We're going to make it available via mp3.com. I'll keep you posted...

       Perhaps it's the violent nature of the show, perhaps it's the seething hell our rehearsals have become, or it could just be that I'm the biggest diva-bitch of all time (doubtful, but I can fantasize, right?)...but I hate this new show I am working on. Well, I don't hate the  show , I hate most of the people in it. Almost every single person is a talentless hack. They make me miserable. They're slow. They're insufferable. They're mediocre. I feel trapped...like a squirrel in a cage. I'm  dying ....

        this just in from an actor friend...I needed to share it with you:  (finally tracked down the original author!! You ROCK, Pam!)   Written by  urlLink Pamela Ribon    Dear Non-Actors:  I'm speaking on behalf of the acting community, here. I'm about to tell you something for your own good. It's risky for me to do this, but here goes:   Don't date us.    Seriously .   Don't date an actor .  I know we seem all very charming and funny and outgoing when you first look at us, but I'm here to tell you something: we are all dying on the inside. We are the worst people in the world to date.  We are all slowly killing ourselves internally.   We are .  We are faced with rejection on a near-daily basis. And as much as we tell you that it doesn't bother us, it does. It hurts the very core of our beings.  We try and cover the pain with humor, or we attempt to dull it with alcohol or cigarettes or whatever-drug-of-choice, but the fact of the matter is it kills us that every single day we have to wake up and still be ourselves.  We are always ourselves.  And it's never good enough.  We are used to only seeing people for six weeks at a time. After that, the sound of that same person's voice will make us want to scream.  We hate it when people tell us what to do, but we will constantly ask for advice. We want a director in our lives. Someone who is telling us things we want to hear (praise, attention, affection), but when that person has constructive criticism, we can't stand him or her anymore.  If you ever tell us how to say something, or correct us on how we remember things, you're pretty much out of our lives forever.  We only have the same six stories about how great some summer show was and we will tell them over and over and over again. We might get into fist fights over the best season of SNL.  We are always talking to ourselves. In the shower, in the car, in our beds at night. Sometimes you'll find us talking to corners, plants, televisions.  We sometimes want you to listen to us say the same three minutes of material you've heard about one million times and then ask if you can see the "subtle" changes we have made.  We are constantly having to see other people's shows, even really bad shows, and we have to tell the person that was in the show that it was really good work.  We're not being a good friend or anything, it's just that deep down we know that if that other person is later up for the same role we're up for, we know that we're better and will get the part.  It's not pretty, and we know it.  We are horrible, terrible, annoying people.  The bitch of it is, every single one of us will tell you that  WE  never want to date an actor.  I bet every actor you know is dating an actor.  If they weren't actors when they started dating, they became actors (or techies) by having to "help out" with a show when someone drops out.  Eventually, everyone in the circle becomes a performer.  Every single one of us will tell you that we never want to date an actor; that they are moody and flaky and irresponsible and self-centered.  And then we crawl right back and date another actor.  Because we are slaves to talent. We're slaves to pretty things.  We are more turned on by stage presence than a good meal.   I'm not kidding .  I don't care how well you cook or dress or hike or catch a football.  We want to see you do some Tony Kushner.  That's all we want. That is so hot.  Realize that I'm going to be in a bit of trouble for spilling our secrets here.  Every single actor feels like the single-worst actor in the world. We all feel like frauds.  That if anyone really knew how much we were faking this whole thing, then we'd be shunned forever.  We never feel prepared.  We think of ourselves first.  We love ourselves more than anyone else in the world, and we hate ourselves just as passionately at the same time.  We will be so happy that we will start crying because we will realize that we may never feel this happy again.  We will be so angry that we will create a huge situation out of the lack of ice in the freezer.  We  create  our own drama.  We  live  and  breathe  drama.  If there's no drama,   you're not living.    We hate each other passionately for forcing us to go see other shows and having to listen to their drama when it's  OUR  drama and  OUR  shows that are the most important.  We'll skip a friend's show to have sex, and then when they skip your show to go on a date, they are the assholes.  You. Can't. Win.  An actor will kill you slowly. We never shut up. We never stop talking. When we've stopped talking it's because we're depressed, and we will be blaming ourselves, but we'll probably take it out on you.  Do you want to live with this?  Just let us date each other and keep on hating and loving each other.  Save yourself the pain and the self-esteem issues.  Sure, we're great at parties, but when the lights go out, we are miserable, moody, overly sensitive people with such paranoid delusions that we are able to convince ourselves that the entire world hates us.  I may never get to do a show again for this, but I think that it's good to let you know now that we are not what we appear to be.  And besides, we're just going to date each other anyway.  We can't help it.

       The board meeting was a bit long tonight, but I have no one else to blame but myself (as chair of the Production/Tech. Council). However, we had 19 people show up...which is good...although not necessarily efficient. I had a nice chat with my mother tonight about Grandma and her condition...she just moved back into her apartment after living with Mom + Dad, and then my Aunt, for the past 10 weeks. I am seriously considering going to the Appalachian Trail Biennial Conference this July. It's being held at Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania - near Harrisburg. There will be meetings, breakout sessions and hiking the Trail! It sounds like a good place for a AT enthusiast and beginner like me. That's all for tonight...see you tomorrow!!

        how to be gay,  erich (02/02/01)      do you feel lonely on friday nights? wouldn't you like to be out hanging with girls, having a good time? well, now you can. you just have to be gay. see, gay people have a talent that heterosexuals do not have: they can be best friends with any girl, because of two reasons: the girls are not interested in them, and they're not interested in girls. the choice is obvious: be gay! the girls will love it.  1. dress. you can't wear just *any* clothes. here are a few tips and tricks to be on top of style, and not the other way around. there are a few types of gay male: muscular, casual, and chic.   a) muscular: step one, you gotta work out, baby! there isn't no way, that you are going out, without some bulging biceps and fab forearms. do the gym thing, honey. bulk up, but down't look too bulky, you know what i mean? you need to have tone, as well as size. you have to draw the line somewhere, you don't want to be called on to lift something heavy, you might sweat! as for visible veins and arteries, don't have too many. you're not arnie-baby, so don't try. now. for your shirts, make sure all of them are skin tight. you can't impress without showing a little muscle now, can you? only wear short sleeve shirts, and make sure they're, abercrombie or gap, and make sure the sleeves don't cover your fabulous biceps. you want to show them, don't you honey? tank tops are also raving. go get 'em, you sexy thing!   b) casual: if you aren't slim or tall, this is your best bet. buy lots of scarves. gap sells plenty of them, so have one for every day of the month. wear earth tones, cargo pants, and outdoorsy footwear. soft fabrics are a must. suspenders are cute, if you accessorize properly. turtlenecks are always a plus. every now and then, to impress your new lady-friends, wear a beret, or if it's cold out, a russian bear-cap.   c) chic: if you want to be chic, prepare to spend a lot on clothes. you also can't be muscular or anything other than slim and lean. black polished shoes are beautiful, baby! buckles are even better. have black pants to wear everywhere, and a black leather jacket. never button it up, always wear it loosely. unless it's freezing. then bitch non-stop about how cold it is. never wear hats, unless you think it matches perfectly. every now and then, wear an all-white outfit, or something trendy. throw out all your torn-off jeans, and re-hem all your pants so there are no worn bottoms.   ready? 2. talk. enunciate. i can't say that any more clearly. you have to speak very clearly. vary yourself on how much time you spend on any one word. inflect your voice from high to low on the last word of every phrase you say. learn to speak like a woman. be delicate, but sure. you are always sure of yourself. adopt a generally higher pitch than that of your heterosexual former friends. always complain. and if you have to say the dreaded f-word and you're in a public place, dart your eyes around the room first, then gasp in a whisper. only use the f-word when you're really pissed off. but that's all the time, right?   3. conversation topics. clothes and style are an obvious one, i shouldn't even have to mention that one. never talk about the weather, unless you are complaining. gossip! talk like a woman! and only talk to women. you should already know that by now. be a feminist. be concerned about nature. just don't talk politics.   4. hair. gelled hair, if you're chic. spiky. obvious broad comb marks. black, platinum, or black. dyeing your hair any other color is dumb. keep your hair trimmed short, but manageable. if you're casual, your only basic requirements are already listed above. you don't need to read more.   extra credit: flap your arm around when you talk. you've seen gay people on tv, you know how they act. be like them. you'll pick up the rest in no time.

       Okay, I'll be honest. I've been behaving like an 18 year-old let loose on campus for the first time. For the past 3 nights, I have managed to be at a bar for last call. How immature is  that ?  Thursday, out with the guys, Friday out with MOST of the cast and last night a party for Andrew's 25th + after-party drinking to boot!! I have re-learned about pacing my alcohol intake vs. total time spent. Even so, it's be unforgettable! However, I will say it has been the most fun I've had in a  long  time! The guys in the cast are really a lot of fun & we're having such a great time together!! Today, I'm doing boring stuff like laundry and taxes just to pay some sort of cosmic pennance (sp?) At any rate, today is a day of rest and recovery, contemplation and chores.

       I wonder how you get a job as an accident investigator at the NTSB? I think my friend Megan and I would be great at this...we like to investigate plane crashes and lay blame. What could be better than working at the NTSB? We'd get to sift thru smoldering wreckage, poke around the rubble and ask the tough questions...not to mention point fingers and accuse airlines of negligence. I think it sounds fun.

       Sorry today's post is so late! I had  Biloxi Blues  brush-up rehearsal last night. Afterwards, 4 of us went our for  a  beer. Well, 6 shots and 2 beers later, it was 1:30 in the morning...and we all knew we'd be hurting. However, Andrew, Brian, Jeffrey and I had such a great time bonding, laughing and telling stories we'd do it again tonight...maybe  we will do it again  tonight. What a blast! It was one of those rare opportunities to look into the guarded secret world of the hetero male. Fascinating and humorous!!

       We did have lobster last night...fresh from Maine. Now, not really knowing how to correctly disassemble a lobster...I looked quite like a two-year-old at the dinner table. I managed with a little help from our friend Chris. Rehearsal was another story. Our director, Bob, never bothered to show up, leaving the 7 of us high and dry. I was encouraged by the fact that everyone still wanted to stay and rehearse...so we ran through Act One twice before disbanding for the evening. At least they show some  sticktoitiveness .

       Okay, well, that seemed to work. Now...I have this great debate going on, which is the better dryer: gas or electric? Just moments before my Florida trip, the dryer seized-up. Now, I am forced to purchase a new one and can't make up my mind. My old one was gas, but the new electric models are a bit cheaper. Does anyone have any thoughts on this one?

Imagine: 85 degrees, sun, beaches...scantily-clad men and women bobbling around the beaches as far as the eye could see....and me in a meeting room with no windows. How's that for sucky? However, I managed to achieve a nice red sunburn as my only souvenir of my 54 hour trip. I will update you all later. In the meanwhile...kisses for all...

       Last night was incredible...just perfect. Low-key, relaxing and wonderful. We had dinner at a Chinese/Vietnamese place which was lighted harshly by fluorescent lighting. The food, however, was amazing. After dinner, we went back to his house to watch television or play cards...but we never quite got that far. Instead, we just curled-up on the couch and watched the snow fall (we've been getting lots of that, lately).

       If you were close enough to kiss, I'd lay a big one on you. Are you okay? You seem upset and/or worried. Of course I still want to see you. If you're worried about what I'm thinking...don't. To be honest, I already had a pretty clear sense about his visit. Call it part intuition and part interpretive skills...in any case, who you choose to see & meet is, of course, totally your prerogative...and I respect that. I hope you know that I am absolutely crazy about you & feel so great that you want to, and choose to spend time with me. Again, I feel so lucky to have you in my life at all. How many times can I say that in one week? LOL. Sending you tons of warm hugs. Shake it off, my cute man.

       Hello there, handsome! I have been thinking about you, and was so glad to get your email. Did you have a great visit with Eric? I had a terrific weekend, which of course started off beautifully with your sweet card...spent some really nice time with friends after the show Friday. Saturday was relaxing...finally got the cell phone replaced, and visited Doug in the studio. I started work on a new song based on that poem I wrote for you last week, it's tentatively titled "the subject of dreams." Saturday's show was a blast, and I got to spend some quality time with my parents afterward. Yesterday flew by in preparation for the Oscar party...which was wonderful & went off without a hitch. People managed to pile in even with the weather being so bad. All in all, a great weekend!! How about you? What did you and Eric do? Give me all the scoop! I was still planning on seeing you tonight, and even though I have given it tremendous amounts of thought, I still haven't decided what we should do. I'm partial to keeping it low-key. Well, I hope you're having a great day. I certainly am thinking of you & I'm looking forward to seeing you. Write soon, I'm having withdrawal...

       Yesterday moved quickly. I spoke to my sweet guy in the morning, before he went to pick up his friend Eric at the airport. I went to the studio to work on a new song with Doug:  the subject of dreams  derived from the poem I wrote Dan last week. It differs slightly from the original. I had GAWM last night, which went terrifically well, and then I went out for a drink with my parents. We really enjoyed catching up last night...really nice to spend some quiet time with them. Tonight, Rachel and I are hosting a little  Oscar  party here at the house. I think we're all set. Well, I hope you're all having terrific weekends, too! Talk to you soon.

       Right. So, I get out to my car last night after the performance and there's something stuck on my windshield. I was thinking: "Crap! Somebody hit my car and left a note!" but it wasn't that at all. Remember how I said I must be dating the sweetest man on the planet? Well, he drove to Chagrin and left the nicest card for me...on my car...so I would find it after the show. He just wanted to let me know he was thinking about me.  Awww

       I am always intrigued when I see search results for this site. Lately, I've been getting a lot of teen-girlie requests on the subject:  Joey+Fatone+girlfriend+pregnant  or  Joey+Fatone+father . Seems like lots of you are worried about the reproductive skills of one of your favorite boyband members. I normally wouldn't have mentioned it, but in the past month, I've seen dozens of the same search request. Just thought it was interesting. How come no one searches  Todd+Stuart+is+a+hottie  ??

       Yesterday was terrific! I had the chance to have dinner with all of Phil's close friends while we celebrated his birthday! After a few too many sips of Chianti, we all headed home. I called Doug and asked if I could come over and work in the studio, which I did. I was able to cut a reasonably decent vocal on sorry, my latest tune,  sorry . Anyway, the studio party didn't end til somewhere slightly after 1AM. I collapsed into bed and drifted, very quickly, into slumber.

       My friend  urlLink Andrew  had a very insightful  urlLink post  (for me), not necessarily because of what he shared, but because it brought up issues of disclosure + truth as a human being, and as a contributor to internet detritus via Blogger. How much should I disclose? Do I say too much? Should I even care what you think? I think my blog oscillates between chore and therapy. Lately, I haven't been dishing it out. For once, my personal life is needing to remain personal. It sheds a different light on how I used to post...a no-holds-barred post-o-matic freakshow, albeit entertaining, was perhaps a little too much. Then again, maybe not.

       Does anyone around here know anything about dream analysis? I had this dream Saturday night into Sunday morning which dealt with me sneaking my friend Tricia out of a medical facility. I don't know why she was there, but she was all feisty and wanted out. So, we get to my car and start driving away. But we get caught by Security. He says that it's a mandatory 7 month prison sentence for both of us, plus I get 2 extra months for being the getaway driver.

       Alright, Taurus:  You knew all along that you had it in you to go the distance, didn't you, Taurus? Your ideas are finally coming to fruition and your dreams are validated along with parking. The world seems to affirm your existence at every turn, and in the simplest of ways. Don't spend too much time talking about yourself -- jealous individuals may think that you're making it all up. Everyone will know soon enough what you've done to deserve all the attention that you're getting.

       For my fellow Taureans today: Taurus  Look backward as well as forward. Your accomplishments have a direct bearing on your destination. There's no need to repeat what you've already done. Move on with cheer and efficiency. Even if that latest thing you were involved with and so dedicated to didn't come off as you would have liked, you still learned a lot and gathered quite a bit of wisdom from your efforts. In the future, you will be more polished and able to take the bull by the horns, wrestle him to the ground and get him to do things your way.

       So, I went to this rehearsal tonight for a special anniversary show being put on by Brecksville Little Theatre in April-May. On one hand, it's great being reunited with a couple people I've done shows with before. Almost the entire original cast of  Jacques Brel  is participating, but we're only doing 2.5 songs from it. On the other hand, the rest of the people are of questionable to moderate talent. If I ponder it too long, I start to worry. One other nice thing: I get to sing "Hello, Little Girl" from  Into The Woods .

I am looking forward to going home this evening and relaxing...maybe reading a book or just vegging out watching television - something I don't get to do very often...but it helps when one runs a supposedly pop-culture oriented weblog. I've been inundated with calls regarding  The Lion King  coming to Cleveland in June 2003. Our press announcement yesterday was hectic, but the results were fantastic. We were splashed all over the 5p, 6p, 7p, 11p, 5a, 6-9a and Noon news programs for the past 24 hours AND I got front page of today's Plain Dealer. Not bad for a day's work.

       Fresh off the plane at Hopkins, I started composing this post, feeling horribly neglectful. But that's they way of it in Omaha. And while the offices I visited there had nifty high-speed internet, I decided not to try and post from there...not wanting the wretched boring-ness of it all to creep in to my blog. How can I describe Omaha? I haven't yet figured it out...such a strange place. I think I was the only person in the entire city wearing a tie today. This morning at the "Burger Lust" Diner, this trailer-trash woman was all sarcastic with me saying, "Niiice tie..."  Whatever. Odd folk out there. There may be only 100 Democrats in all of Nebraska, and I think I met 10 of them. Otherwise, everyone's SUPER-CONSERVATIVE. Imagine, if you will, the largest office "tower" in downtown...the "Woodmen" tower...named after this right-wing uber-Christian insurance company. Just looking at it gave me the willies.  Yechhhh!  Anyway, the downtown districts are completely void of people, activity and places to go. In short: I hated it. Now, I am not a metro-snob. I love cities. I love the country. My best friend growing up lived on a working dairy farm...I've milked cows, for chrissakes, but Omaha was the worst of both worlds. Dead downtown littered with odd gentlemen's clubs, half-rate hotels and rundown office and retail storefronts....and a business/industry area dominated by Con-Agra, Swanson's and a meat-packing plant with lines of cows headed for the slaughter. And, it was all beige and gray. The land, the buildings, the people...the whole mood. I felt that I needed to run screaming back to Cleveland. I almost put on my cross-country running spikes and set of in an eastward direction. The most excitement is east of Omaha. Know what's east of Omaha? Iowa. Woo-hoo.  Oh my god, pack-up my house and get me to Nebraska! I have seen the excitement & I must go immediately.  This is, of course, to say nothing of the business end of matters...which was very intriguing and an otherwise wonderful opportunity. Anyway, upon take-off in out twin engine jet-prop, I breathed a sigh of relief, knowing I was getting out of Omaha...even if the wings iced-over and we took a nosedive into a cornfield, I knew I wouldn't be stuck in Omaha. It was a very weird "other dimension" kind of trip...feeling like I was in an alternate reality...a really boring one. Needless to say, I am ecstatic to be home.

       I think this may be the longest I've ever gone without posting. My apologies. I had a terrific opening weekend with the play I'm doing  Getting Away With Murder . We had a sold-out show on Saturday! I also had a wonderful date Saturday afternoon. We had lunch at the Clifton Diner and then rented  Lady and the Tramp . He has two Siamese cats named Si and Am...just like the movie, but he had never seen it. We watched the movie, listened to music and spent the afternoon talking & relaxing with each other. I can't remember such a wonderful afternoon/first date ever. He's such a sweet guy...not to mention handsome. Then, on Sunday, I flew to Omaha, Nebraska. Never been before. Probably will never go again. Glad to be back home in Cleveland!

We celebrated her good news with Kathy and Beth at Snickers for dinner and drinks. Then, we all went back to the studio to play music and be silly.

       Ever have one of those days where you just have piles and piles of work (with no end in sight) and you never seem to get ahead of the game? Yeah? Well, that's what this past month has been for me. I am SO glad it's March already. Wheeee! Cupcakes for all!

       So, I decided to take my lunch break at home today...running back to shower and shave...so I could at least have a decent appearance for the second half of the day. I feel MUCH better.

       ooh! today started out ROUGH! I got out of bed LATE for a big meeting with my boss and a sponsor. With only 20 minutes, I dressed and hit the road. I made it to the meeting on time, but I look a little rough...is it Monday already??

       So, an update. Turns out, that scary pain in my groin was some sort of pulled muscle in the pelvic region. It's almost completely gone now. Thanks to everyone who shared their concerns with me. So, for now I am relatively pain-free. Today was a crazy one here at work...we had a special even from 4-6pm which I had to MC. I'm headed home now, and then over to the studio to do some work. More later...

        my big gay life (7)    Patrick's birthday party/ urlLink Queer As Folk  party was a lot of fun, although I wish the episode of QAF was better. I guess they all can't be incredible. Anyway, Adam was not there, so I did not get to flirt ruthlessly. But, the company was great...to be happy and laughing and generally not caring about my singledom, if only for an hour. So much for my big gay life, eh? I came home, talked and pet my dog, Toby until Trish called from Philadelphia. After our nightly conversation, I crawled into bed and crashed into dreamland instantly.

       Yesterday was really wonderful. After checking in at work for an hour or so, I went to the bike shop on Lorain to purchase a bike rack for my Jetta, a new Kryptonite lock and a slick new black bike helmet. Shortly thereafter, I went for a ride on the Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath. The weather was gorgeous and the ride, exhilirating. Afterwards, I helped move some furniture for my parents and then joined Kelly for a nice light supper.

        my big gay life (6)    So, it's Sunday. Kelly's made a beautiful brunch for the both of us (brunch?! how gay is that?). I have to pop in to work for a few minutes and then the afternoon is free. I have proposed that we go bike riding in the park for two reasons: the health benefits, and the potential cute men who may also be riding today. We are also scheduled to visit with DVDave and gang for  urlLink Queer As Folk  night. Quite possibly, that lanky, tall, handsome Adam will be there. If so, I shall flirt ruthlessly.

        my big gay life (5)       I think some young cops are cute, okay? I do. Not the older, pot-bellied, good-ole-boy version...but the slick, handsome, fit ones who make you want to drive recklessly in hopes of getting pulled over. This was my thought today as Kelly and I were driving back from a little retail frenzy this afternoon. Our little tour took us to Borders, Gap and to Nature's Bin. Sound hideously yup-urban? It is, I guess. There's no denying it. Between our closets full of Gap, Structure and J. Crew, our tables and shelves filled with books on every imaginable subject and a refrigerator full of healthy, organic foods...it's no wonder I don't have a boyfriend. I'm too preppy, well-read and healthy. The right guy will never find me if I keep up these shenanigans.      Note to self: Eat more Twinkies!

        my big gay life (4)       You know how I mentioned that whole internet thing? I find it sad to see my ex-boyfriends online so much. For instance, if I sign on to check various email accounts, I'll often see them on my buddylists online in gay chatrooms, or cruising personals...and it seems so weird to me. It's like they're out there looking for the next best thing...and they think they'll find it on the internet?! It boggles the mind, really. I think  okay, so you had me in 3-D, living color...and yet I wasn't enough. So now, you'd rather be cruising around in some ridiculous e-fantasy never finding what it is you think you want.   And then I just feel like they're all sad and pathetic.    Note to self: remove ex-boyfriends from buddy lists.

       Good news, so far. When I spoke to the nurse this morning, she asked me a battery of questions and then relayed the info to the doctor on duty. He didn't think it was something I needed to be seen for right away, so I made an appointment for Monday afternoon.  Needless to say, I feel quite a bit of relief knowing it doesn't seem to be anything major.

        my big gay life (3)                   I am worried. I need to be serious for a minute. This past week, I've had this mild discomfort/ache in my groin/testicles. It seems more pronounced when I sit, and it almost vanishes when I stand. I wanted to wait a couple days to see if I had just strained something. However, I fear I must now go to my doctor tomorrow to have it/them looked at. Naturally, all I can think about is testicular cancer or a hernia. These are nice, light issues for me to ponder as I go off to do the show tonight. In any case, I am going to the doctor as soon as they can see me. I'll let you know the outcome. Let's all hope it's something stupid and minor. The worst part is, it's not like I can say it might have been some wild sex injury...because, as we all know, I'm not having any of  that .

        my big gay life (2)    I have decided that my next boyfriend should know absolutely nothing about the internet, computers or chat rooms. I think, in some ways, the internet allows for artificial intimacy. Words are powerful. People say things they might not say in person. The internet enables a superficial closeness, so by the time you get to actual physical intimacy, no one knows what they're doing. Except me, of course, because I am smart, funny and handsome. So, will my next boyfriend be Amish? Hard to say. I'm not big into no electricity, churning butter or waking at the butt-crack of dawn. Where is that technologically-hopeless man of mine? I know he must be out there.

        my big gay life (1)    The one rule that always stands true in the smoking wreckage of my love life is this:  they always come back . My ex-boyfriends are as reliable as boomerangs...they dump me and then return to the scene of the crime. Invariably. Unfailingly. Always. Granted, it takes some longer than others, but they always come back. Take, for instance, Joe who unceremoniusly dispatched me after his trip to Barcelona and some sketchy details about a "friend" named Miguel. This past week I started receiving telephone calls and emails from him asking me to contact him. In the end, I finally couldn't take the harassment anymore and called him. He wanted to know if there were any summer internships where I work. Huh. Or even better, more recently, Dan, who decided this week that it would be okay to IM me. Apparently he felt enough time had passed. He said he just wanted to say hello and ask how I was doing and that he'd love it if I would call or email him. Eventually, I had to cut off his keyboard diarrhea. Did I say it was time to start talking again? Did I send out a memo or something?

       The day after. We worked in the studio til 11pm or so...cranked out the composition for  Say the Perfect Thing  which has turned out to be jazz-oriented. One of these days, I'll post some MP3s.

       I am going into the studio tonight for the first time since the night Dan broke it off with me. Even though I've been a writing maniac, I have yet to get into the studio. I feel so at home there, and definitely I feel at the top of my game, creatively. Back to the live theatre show tomorrow.

       I hate having a cold. When I'm on these antihistimines, I feel like I am floating a few inches above the ground. Such a weird feeling! Hard to focus on anything at all. I probably just need a nap, or something.

       Well, it was an early morning today. I had to do some early morning publicity with Santa and the Rockettes from Radio City's Christmas Spectacular...who just announced they are coming to Cleveland this December. Anyway, we had a couple of interviews, and then the big announcement back at one of our theatres. Now, I am playing catch-up and trying to avoid any incoming ex-boyfriends. Ack! Anyone got any advice on this recurring boyfriend thing?

       Okay. Ex boyfriends are resurfacing by the millions today. okay...not really...but both Joe and Dan have contacted me today. What's up with that? It's not a full moon...I checked. Does anyone have any rationale for this behavior? i don't understand why they all come back...somebody somewhere must know something.

       Lately, things seem a bit hazy. I am not unhappy, but I am also not  happy  happy. You know what I am saying? The goal for this week will be to refocus and reprioritize life...thus decluttering the path to happiness...or some garbage like that. At any rate, life is blazing along. Thanks for the great response to my experiemental voiceBlog. I am going to try and do a unique voiceBlog post there daily that will dovetail with what I write here...with out being duplicitous.

       Well, I did that 5pm show.  Dreadful . Went out to grab a bite to eat with Sally before heading home at 9pm. An exhausted Kelly arrived home at 11:30 from her weekend travels only to find a big, fat law school rejection letter. I feel so horrible for her...she really wanted to go to Marshall, and now she has to rethink the whole thing. What's worse is, college rejections bring up every possible bad feeling about every rejection you've ever had in your entire life. It's true. So, the weekend had a cataclysmic ending...and out of the smoking wreckage emerged Monday morning...

        gawd  could I be any more dull today? I have spilled coffee on my khaki shorts thrice this morning, and I'm in no shape whatsoever to speak to or be seen by other people. I have decided that Starbucks will be the reason I get thru this afternoon's show. How do you get thru the 7th show of the week? I mean, we're all exhausted and CRANKY! Then, there's the issue of what to do after the show...go out with cast? Go directly home? Why do I even care?

       For those of you who have asked, the opening of our treacherous little musicale opened quite triumphantly last evening. We are sold-out this entire week, and the audience's mean age is about 80, so we are a hit no matter what we do. I don't think the audiences (collectively) can see or hear all that well...which explains the mad rush for tickets. Today, I took Toby (my dog) to Starbucks for a triple grande latte and then for a walk at Edgewater Park. I've been prone to fits of crying these past two days. Not one to run away from emotion, I just let it happen and try to understand it later. Maybe it's some delayed break-up crud that's surfacing. In any case, I'm really doing just fine, but crying here and there. For the most part, I'm pretty happy. I've decided to experiment with a little voicemail blog. I am going to do a short blog entry on an extension mailbox on my home number. When you hear my greeting, hit 1 on the keypad and that will give you my voiceBlog. Just gonna try it out. If you want to check it out, my number is: 216-281-2237.

       So, I have to go to the theatre soon. Well, the other theatre where I'll be singing tonight. I've noticed an appalling lack of gay men in the theatre of late, and I've wondered why. Maybe it's just regional? Anyway, in the past 3 or 4 shows I've done, it's been me and maybe one other person. Not the way it used to be. In the olden days, I would do shows  swarming  with gay folk. Just a weird curiosity I've noticed...no big whoop...

       Two of my close friends are currently on vacation in Europe. Jennie, who lives there anyway, is in Spain (as mentioned in an earlier blog entry) with ger German boyfriend, Markus. My friend Margaret is in Italy for 6 weeks hiking, biking and just generally fading into the landscape. She wants to visit small towns, major attractions and everything she can cram into 6 weeks. I have no idea where she is or what she's doing at this moment, however, I did beg her to visit Capri.

       Went to lunch with the crew from work today...we celebrated Heather Marshall's 27th at the  urlLink Great Lakes Brewing Company . It's a brewery/restaurant that's been in my neighborhood for decades. My costume from  Into The Woods  arrived from Broadway this morning, so I am all set for tonight's show.

       I've been  moody  these past few days. Maybe it's just exhaustion from final rehearsals, maybe it's a slow-creep depression that has wallowed-up around me. For whatever reason, I'm feeling  crappy  today...and I shouldn't. I mean, it's opening night, tonight. Granted, it's a two-bit piece of fluff/garbage, but it has provided a decent distraction from the whole Dan situation. I would say, with some certainty, that I am doing better every day. It's not that I think about him less, I am just learning to think about him differently. I very much want to be able to be friends, I just don't know how that works from this vantage point. I need to get to a place where I can be open and honest, without feeling the pangs of separation. I've done it before. I can do it again. I'll wait until I know I'm really ready. I do miss him. I miss him very much.  Oh l'amour ...

       My schedule this week would have been enough to kill a lesser man. Between work and final rehearsals, I'm getting about 6 hours of sleep a night (not enough for me) and I'm just exhausted. Last night was talent meltdown night at the theatre. Several of us just blew chunks in the performance dept. Yuck! I'd have fired me. Brain farts and mind-snaps all around. Whew! Glad that one's over!!

       Last night got a little weird. Good weird. Kelly and I had Laurie and Scott over for a cocktail before heading out to a benefit at the Beachland Ballroom. It was titled, "I Beg Your Parton," a tribute to Dolly Parton...and a benefit for  SWAY  this really cool 'zine Kelly's friend John Chaich publishes. We stayed there until midnight, and then headed back west to a neighborhood dive called Lou & Eddy's...complete with horrifyingly monstrous karaoke. Those Levi's commercials don't do this justice. We ate a lot of fried food, and by 2am, I was spent. I crashed immediately upon hitting my pillow. Today, I ran a few errands, went to the market to buy fruit for the fruit salad I'm making for Easter brunch. THen I decided I really needed to go for a good long hike in the woods, alone. A little soul-searchin' time, y'know? Anyway, it was wonderful! A really vigorous and healing 7 mile hike. I love those natural endorphines...  Strangely enough, I wrote a refrain for a new song...it's really gospelly and churchy. I know Doug will love it. Tonight, I am going to see  Bridget Jones's Diary  albeit with my parents...I know, it sounds glamourous and fabulous, doesn't it? I can't help it, I like hanging-out with the old timers.  Just kidding, Mom.

       I have just returned from the  Great All-American Suburban Shopping Mall Experience  at the South Park Center in Strongsville, Ohio. The place was mobbed with hundreds of look-alike teen girlies and boyz. It's amazing what a couple hundred bucks can buy you in the self-esteem department. After all, I know the new pair of jeans I purchased won't break-up with me (tongue firmly planted in cheek). Today is Good Friday, the 13th...and it really is. The sun is high and bright and life is good...

       Well, yesterday's porch-fest was a blast! Rachel and I sat outside in the warm evening air, drinking beer and chatting with neighbors. Hottie Jon stopped over, so that was, of course, a big bonus. It was a terrific way to start the evening. At about 8:30 we headed out to  The Patio  for drinks with our crew from work. It was a fun and much needed happy evening. FYI, the new dryer is amazing...

       I had a great chat with Trish last night. I explained to her that I really wasn't experiencing the typical whirlwind/cyclone/rollercoaster emotional reaction that I had anticipated in this particular break-up situation. Instead, it's like a slow, gentle hum. Kinda like how you can only hear the refrigerator when the house is quiet...it's like that. There seems to be a consistent and constant stream of low-level sadness...which is extremely manageable. I let myself feel it, but it's not distracting me. Daily reminders of him don't seem to plunge me into the pit of dispair. My mind has moved onto thoughts of new experiences, people and places. Life is pretty good, and when surrounded by the overwhelming abundance in my life...it's hard not to feel like the luckiest guy on the planet. Maybe it's better to count your blessings than to dawdle on useless bad feelings? Anyway, if you're reading this, Blogger must be cooperating...

       Today's exciting news is that I got my brand-new dryer delivered! The guys came and hooked it up, and carted the old beast away. I now have a super-efficient gas dryer. Since it cost so much, I have only the funds to stay at home and do laundry all weekend. My mother insists that this  urlLink Maytag  is the best appliance made anywhere,  ever . I figure that I've done my share helping out the  durable goods  sector of our economy. What did  you  do??

       I have triumphed over the last 24 hours. I have lived in the moment, not in denial. Yet, I have managed to maintain vulnerability and humility. As always, my friends and family shared kind words, a  thoughtfulness so touching, and inspiring. But here, in the long lonely hours of night, I come face to face with the sadness and rejection. My cheeks flush and I feel like I have somehow failed. I know this is not true, but it's the feeling, nevertheless. Sometimes I hate the night. Sitting in the darkness when sorrow visits, entertaining the seemingly endless pit in my stomach. Begging for sleep...for rest, or reprieve. The night and the gloom suffocating and choking...there and yet leaving me always...alone.

       After another email regarding his newly-written page 4 of our serial, I had to send a brief email asking him to respect my need for time & space. It's just too painful right now to keep hearing from him.

       The chronology of a heart undone:    I was dumped last night. I was informed that despite telling me Friday that he only wanted to date me & no one else, somehow by Monday I was not everything he wanted & hoped for in a romantic relationship. Pardon me while I recover from the whiplash of it all. I am trying to decide whether or not to post several of his emails to me in an effort to show you the wonderful romance that was ours. I'm still a little shocked, but I'll be fine. Mamma Doug took care of me last night...cooked me dinner and talked. Of course we had to channel some of my pain into a new song, which actually turned out very well. We're both eager to polish it up. It's titled  It's Time .

       So, I have this rehearsal tonight for this concert thingy I'm doing for Brecksville. They reunited a couple of their former casts into one big review-type show. So far, it's a big train-wreck. I am so hoping it pulls itself together. My faith is bolstered only by the fact that  Getting Away With Murder  finally hit its stride...and if  that  show could, this one can, too.

       Let's see, I didn't really recap my Ft. Lauderdale trip for you. I left early Wednesday morning on a flight that wasn't even half-full, so I got to stretch-out and relax on my journey south. Jim, my boss, and I stayed at the  urlLink Radisson Bahia Mar , which is located right on A1A and the beach! You couldn't imagine a nicer location for some industry meetings. We managed to get a few hours in the sun at the beach and at the private pool. We enjoyed a leisurely casual dinner across the marina at Bahia Cabana, watching the yachts slip in and out of the Middle River. They say the marina sees more than $500 million dollars worth of vessels every year. We then hit the Greyhound Racetrack in Hollywood, Florida, for a few races. I managed to win $16. The next day was filled with meetings and reunions, as we all said hello to friends and colleagues from across the country. We enjoyed a nice evening cruise up the Middle River, a tour of the Broward Center and dinner at this really fantastic riverside restaurant that I don't remember the name of....My flight home on Friday was sold-out. Packed to the gills...and late. As always, it was great to get home, but I really miss the warmth, the green and the ocean...

       this update courtesy of my boredom: my vocal rehearsal last night went fairly well...I'm still trying to break-thru some of the nasty effects of my now long-departed cold. However, I was quite pleased that I could still sing, and that my cords aren't permanently paralyzed. Afterwards, I went to the studio with Doug to finish all the Post work on  Big City Lights . He did a fantastic lead take, and I think we gotta single. I'll keep you updated, as always.

        my big gay life [23]    So much for rest and relaxation this weekend! Friday, after a long day catching-up at the office, I took a brief nap and then Kelly and I went to Johnny Mango for dinner and drinks. While we were there, our friend Frankie (the chef) sat with us for a little while after he was through for the night. Kelly and I were having some mighty tasty Margaritas, when this guy (a server) comes over to chat with Frankie. It's his birthday and he offers to buy us a shot. Naturally, I accept. He's cute. Shaved head, dark goatee and tattoos...so not my type...except that he's sweet as hell. So, he invites me to meet him out at a club where he's meeting a few friends. Kelly and I both go. He leans over at one point and asks if I'm dating anyone. I, of course, say no. He then asks if he gives me his number, and I give him mine, could we call each other? I say sure, why not? What the hell? So, we spent a lot of time talking that night. I like talking. Anyhow, on Sunday, I went to DVDave's for my belated birthday party to celebrate with my big gay posse. After watching  Further Tales of the City , we headed out to Funky Buddha to go dancing. We stayed out til closing - I had a blast shakin' my groove thang. It's been so long since I've been dancing...and the best part is, the club didn't get busted-down by the ATF, DEA, FBI and SWAT like last time.

        unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 17  March 11    Hey Todd, Maybe on your flights to and especially back from Omaha.. wouldn't  want anyone to be stuck there..but especially YOU after a very nice time on  Saturday. As far as other wishing you luck otherwise.. nah.. don't think  you need it.. your talented as it stands and personally I think they'd be  dumb not to snatch you up, but then again, I don't know how intelligent  Omahaians are (yea, I made that up.. and for their sake I hope thats not a  word they identify themselves as). Oh, and by the way.. You left me smiling too, I really enjoyed  your company. I felt very comfortable with you (if you didn't notice) and  enjoyed listening to you as much, if not more then your wonderful emails I  receive. I definitely want to continue getting to know you and spending  more time together (perhaps less Disney flicks) I actually enjoyed it and  having wanted to see it, it was special to me that you shared that with me. Congratulations on your sold out show... I think I came across a  press release about a hot man in handcuffs.. did there seem to be a large  crowd of leather and S&M types?? Actually I would even love to see it. Well, I'm sure I missed you before you left to Omaha.. so you most  likely won't get this email until you get back.. so I hope everything went  as you would want it to go, since you have no camera.. I will have to  depend on your interpretations of what the city of Omaha is like and the  people, I look forward to hearing your descriptions. Actually, I look  forward to hearing form you... I think I may just go through a 36 hour  withdrawal of getting my Todd fix. I'm really enjoying getting to know you  and where it goes. My dinner is ready, Stuffed peppers.. so I am going to send this  and eat.. I'm just thinking of what you could be doing this exact moment...  hmmm  Well, I talk to you when you get back.  xoxox Dan    At 01:42 AM 3/11/01 -0500, you wrote: Dan,  First and foremost, thanks for a really wonderful afternoon. You made me feel so at ease, so comfortable...and I had such a terrific day with you. It was so difficult to tear myself away. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. I'm having such a great time getting to know you. I love that we've had a chance to write so much, I think that's why I was so at ease immediately. At any rate, I can't express how wonderful today was for me. I really would like to spend more time with you & hope you feel the same. Tonight's performance was indeed sold-out! It was a thrill arriving at the theatre (still floating a few inched above the ground from our date) to find the box office turning people away! Nice to be in a box office hit!! The show went off without a hitch, and I managed not to mangle my knee too badly tonight. Afterwards, a small handful of us went out for a drink before heading home. I wanted to make sure to write you an email before I set off to Omaha Sunday afternoon. Please wish me luck on what will most definitely be an interesting 36 hours. I hope you have a terrific day...all I do is think of you & smile.    xoxo    Yours,  Todd    ps - you are handsome, witty and sweet...now I'm the one who is captivated...

I have been whacked-out busy today with Disney (of course) who now would like a major press event for next Tuesday...which should be interesting with me absent on Monday. So many things to freak-out about...so little time.  As I said in my most recent phone message, let's definitely plan on doing something tomorrow afternoon. I'm not due back at the theater until 7pm...so an afternoon date would be perfect. For reference, I like skim milk.

         birthday weekend recap    Trish came into town last Friday at about 5pm. We headed over to Doug's for the quick drive to Akron. Doug, Joni and I were doing an acoustic gig at Angel Falls. I had started to lose my voice and was not able to really sing out, Louise, so I sang what I could and acted as emcee. On Saturday, we spent time prepping for my birthday party at Phil's. The party itself was a huge success and was the best way to ring-in my new decade. Sunday was spent with my family out in Aurora...we grilled out, had birthday cake and enjoyed ourselves. In the evening, Trish and I made a brief appearance at DVDave's for D.A.S. (Danny Appreciation Society - stems from Real World New Orleans....now the official group name for any tv/movie event we do together). In the early morning, I took Trish to the airport, finished up a few errands and then returned to the airport for my flight to LaGuardia.

Then watched an episode of SPACE 1999 (borrowed DVD set), remember that?.. wow, so funny to watch them now. I got Pizza from Angelo's ..mmm very good and washed it down with rootbeer.. something about pizza and rootbeer..or even a real cold..... Are you a Coke or Pepsi boy? Then watched the repeat of Will and Grace, it was the Cher episode. I'm ready for new one now...I've only had the opportunity to catch Queer As Folk on occasion, but have seen some episodes - I wasn't to thrilled with it at first.. but I think I can appreciate it for what it's worth, however some of the characters I just don't like. I did decide to get the British version on DVD, however when it came.. it was made in a different color system and region.. so it wouldn't play on my DVD player.. needless to say I had to send them back.. I better get a full refund! Although the boxed set of Absolutely Fabulous is to be out on DVD soon.. I must get that, even though I own all the videos. Do you have DVD yet? Well all in all we had a great time, laughed our asses off about planning a practical joke on a friend of ours.         So now back to your previous email in which I have not completely finished responding to... didn't get to all your interests.. was I in there?? I see you love reading and writing (of which you do very nicely - and expressive also with a sense of humor that comes out). Do you write more then just to me? Are you writing some wonderful and interesting novel? I've been told I should .. but I can only imagine sending the reader to say, whoa.. I need to go back.. that ride was just like the Millennium Force.. of which I've rode 3 times all ready.. once at night. ROLLER COASTER, SCARY OR EXCITING? What do you enjoy reading, besides my emails of course?..WHAT BOOK ARE YOU READING NOW? FAVORITE AUTHOR? I just finished Armisted Maupin's The Night Listener, before that David Sedaris, Me Talk Pretty - very funny, I like his humor and style of writing. I still need to get Barrel Fever, I have the others. I just recently bought Christopher Rice's Density of Soul's, and on the second chapter. He's the son of Ann Rice, and he's gay..shhh. So far my favorite author is Armisted Maupin, from his six book novel of Tales Of The City, I was hooked on him and have bought and read everything. I also own the videos of Tales Of The City.. ever see it? He did More Tales Of The City.. but I don't care for some of the replaced characters. Ok, the movie topic.. thats definitely an in person long depth discussion there. I love movies.. from some popular Hollywood, to independents, to foreign - comedies, dramas, sci fi (although not into the whole Trekkie thing - not that it's bad), also other genres of movies..although not a big horror or documentary fan.WHAT IS YOUR MOST DISLIKED ACTOR? mine is Jim Carrey. I have my movies all ready picked out for the film festival, do you go? Been to any movies at the Cleveland Cinematheque? I also subscribe to Hot Tickets, which I get to see preview screenings of movies before they hit the theatre..perhaps you'll be a future date to one.Moving right along, theatre, yep love that too.. biking, very good... perhaps some biking together too.. love the trails at the tow path, ever been?..most of the time I will bike to Edgewater park (and not to cruise), down the hill and back up..huffing and puffing and into Lakewood and back.. and also sometimes to Rocky River Reservation. Hockey is actually fun to watch, went to a Jacks game a couple years ago.. suppose to go again with another friend. Volleyball is fun too - never got into tennis and golfing... (I know golfing isn't one you mentioned - but added it for me) Actually the one chance I had to golf was with my brothers in Palm Springs when we were all there for a convention (Entrepreneur Of The Year Award - we didn't win for National) They played golf, I decided it was SPA day.. massage, pool, sunning, steam and dry sauna, annihilation room...much more relaxing then looking like a fool on the green! I think you'd agree. Music, enjoy that too... and have a feeling we may have more in common then just Sade. Although the composing music has eyebrow raised of interest..Also excited you also share my interests as well.. I love to try new things, or occasionally do things out of the ordinary like bowling.         So to Omaha, NE... would you believe there is a gay life there.. info here at http://208.249.122.222/travel/invoketravelarticle.cfm?ID=B0A8DBD8-98D6-11D4-A7B700A0C9D84F02&method=guidefulldisplay - if your interested. Ft Lauderdale will be much better to go to.. I wanna go with! I was just there for my birthday and in Miami in January, celebrated my 30th.. and I had a good time.. spent it with friends I have there plus saw a slew of Cleveland people there too.         I guess I'm a folk that loves underwear, you know you can buy it all ready worn by hot jocks in some magazines?? I have no underwear fetish.. doesn't really matter to me, although I do think boxerbreifs are a bit sexy...but I agree with you, my interest lies in that of whom it just so happens to be wearing the underwear... but key point.. they do wear something.         Scuba.. at the YMCA (no arm gestures please) downtown, also recently joined, I didn't realize how gay it is either..I thought they all went to Ballys.. anyway, I just go to work out.. So you gave up scuba? :( Are you certified? Does that mean you can't scuba with me in Hawaii??          So what are your plans for Saturday? My friend is having me over dinner Saturday night.. but we could do something in the afternoon if you'd like to, I could rent Lady And the Tramp, drink milk with Si and Am... What kind of milk do you drink? 2%, 1% Fat Free, Whole? Lactose Intolerant?   more questions (limited to 20):  WHAT'S ON YOUR MOUSE PAD? don't have a mouse pad FAVORITE SMELLS?  FAVORITE SOUNDS?  WORST FEELING IN THE WORLD?  WHAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING?  WHAT IS THE LAST THING YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU GO TO BED? WHAT IS IMPORTANT IN LIFE?  FAVORITE FOODS?  CHOCOLATE OR VANILLA?  DO YOU LIKE TO DRIVE FAST? STORMS - COOL OR SCARY?  DO YOU LIKE RAIN? WILL YOU RUN IT? WHAT TYPE WAS YOUR FIRST CAR?  IF YOU COULD MEET ONE PERSON DEAD OR ALIVE?  FAVORITE ALCOHOLIC DRINK?  IS THE GLASS HALF EMPTY OR HALF FULL? depends on what it's filled with DO YOU TYPE WITH YOUR FINGERS ON THE RIGHT KEYS?  WHAT'S UNDER YOUR BED?  WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE NUMBER?  WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE COLOR?           Ok, that should keep you busy, lol if your not all ready swamped today.. actually I need to do some things and get some work done myself.. meeting the folks at 1pm for lunch. Awww..Si is sitting here on my lap as I type you.. so cute. Well, I hope your having a great day.. look forward to another one of your wonderful emails. Perhaps we can get together sometime tomorrow, let me know.. otherwise I look forward to sometime next week.  fondly, Dan  ps. not fondling, thats something else.

        my big gay life [22]   Well, I've returned. The city was just as I knew it would be: exhausting, wet and fun.It was  BIG , it was  GAY .  Fabulous ! I arrived on Monday morning, already pooped from my birthday weekend. I checked into the hotel and unpacked. I got a brief nap in before I had to meet the rest of the staff for the 1st ever  urlLink National Broadway Theatre Awards  (basically, the Tony Awards for touring shows). While there, I saw Robert Sean Leonard, Alan Cumming, Ben Vereen and Brian Stokes Mitchell...so that was fun. The following 3 days were jam-packed with meetings and various social gatherings. I did get to see a few shows, the latest revival of  urlLink Follies , the cotton-candy revival of  urlLink 42nd Street  and my favorite,  urlLink Proof  starring Mary-Louise Parker. She and it are going to win Tony Awards...mark my words.

        unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 14  March 8   Hey Todd,         Just a few words, as I know Mr. Sandman is taunting you to bed, hell I'd prolly be too.. ooopps did that thought excrete out of my hand... well..mind you it is that hand...the typing hand... oh, I better stop there...oh my. (N2S:come back to decide if to remove)         So - briefs? boxers? or boxer briefs? or? Not sure if it's too soon to know that intimate detail...but you brought the question up in your boxer-brief email...Just curious.. maybe someday I'll be surprised...and no I'm not horny right now... I have company coming over soon too.. so I too may cut this short all at once and may send before I complete thought has finished. These things usually go late anyway.         I just started taking scuba lessons at the YMCA. Providing we get one more, because we need 4 people for the class to be a go. Are you certified? Maybe there'll be a scuba trip in our future? hmmm.. I can't wait to hear about the Sea World animals, now that is has been swallowed up by Six Flags. I still haven't gone to that park.. like Cedar Point so much more. I think less trash too.         Man this does have to be breif, doorbell just rang... I will continue...more I want to comment.. but hopefully, your night was bearable and I can at least with this boxerbreif email (as thats what I wear) bring a smile (and get your mind outta the gutter) as you lay to sleep waiting for sweet and wonderful dreams to refresh you for a brand new day.  Goodnight (HUG)  Dan P.S. Saturday could work, lets talk about it.      At 04:03 PM 3/8/01 -0500, you wrote:  Dan, My fever-pitched work day has now left me in a state of catatonia. We' supposed to go to this staff party at 4pm. All I want is a nap. So, I am sorry to say, this email will have to be a bit brief...boxer-brief, I think.  N2S (note to self): Must watch Dan scarf down his food sometime. Maybe you and I could have a contest...who can inhale food the fastest?  You came all the way down here and didn't stop in my cube?!? How disappointing.  :(  You said you drove by on your way home from Scuba. Forgive me, but are you talking about Scuba class or a club? I had to take Scuba classes when I worked at Sea World. Yes, I spent 6 years working as a Narrator for all the animal exhibits. You name it, I can talk about it...at GREAT length.  I have a housemate, Kelly, who (obviously) shares the house with me and Toby. She's off in Florida at the moment.  My interests are varied: I love writing, reading, movies, theater, skiing, hiking, biking, hockey, volleyball, tennis, music (listening and writing/composing) to name a few things. I share your interests in roller-coasters, boating, swimming...have never roller-bladed but want to...I've dreamed of careening recklessly... dangerously on concrete sidewalks and in public parks...  I think Lady and the Tramp would be a fantastic first date! But, it can't be Sunday, as I am flying out to   Omaha that afternoon. I am afraid that I won't be back until Monday evening. Maybe it'll have to be a Sat. matinee?  Well, they're shrieking for me, so I have to finish up here. I hope you have a terrific night...I'll definitely be thinking about you...and wishing I was there.  If you manage to find any time at all, drop me a quick note so when I drag my bruised and battered self home at 11:30...I'll have something to make me smile. You made my night last night & bet you didn't know it.  All my best,  Todd

        my big gay life [21]   I'm revisiting my issues with the internet. If one were to take a casual survey of the various websites serving the gay community here in Cleveland, one would notice my dear, sweet ex, Dan, consistently (if not constantly) visiting these sites, checking personal ads, chatting, erecting his own personal ads, etc. Now, mind you, I do not have a lot of time during the day to do a lot of surfing. I'm able to hit Blogger a couple times, read a little and get on with my work day. He, on the other hand, has an inexhausible amout of time to spend online chatting and such. It just got me thinking that how could anyone possibly think they're going to find anything fantastic online? Not to say that there aren't examples of successful pairings, but for the most part, the internet is like a vast ocean...and people are hunting for sunken treasure. While online, it's easy to project your own desires, wants and needs onto another person, but when you meet them face-to-face, reality sets in. It's safer to manipulate your own little world online that it is to deal with real human beings in real time. I am not making any condemnations about the internet, but I do think that it has proved equally disastrous as helpful in the realm of human relations. The question begs asking: why bother meeting anyone at all if you think there's even the remote chance they're spending time surfing/cruising around the internet looking for something better...something they can't put they're finger on...but something better...something more?  It's such flawed thinking. I've seen it destroy more than one relationship, and it seems to have played a bigger role in the demise of my most recent relationship than I ever thought. What do we do? We are called to be even more vigilant and even more trusting than ever before. There are more opportunities for betrayal and dishonesty than one could imagine. However, there are infinite opportunities for trust, love and loyalty. I wish I had more faith in humankind. I wish it was all easier.

       Just like when my old friend, Bruce Hornsby said "that's the way it is..." I find myself in a quiet blissful place. Nothing too snazzy, nothing too exciting or happy going on, just calm and steady...it's just the way it is. And it feels good. Nothing makes me happier than to feel like I've got both feet firmly planted in the soil...heart open wide...and a fresh take on life.  These are the days we remember . Indeed. Maybe turning 30 this week gains me new perspective, like turning a corner to see a whole new block laid-out before you. I don't know what's ahead for me, but it looks like a long and interesting road. I hike on toward my horizon, smile firmly planted on face...whistling a happy tune.

       A reminder, dear readers, that the series you are reading titled  unravel in 58  is a way for you to join me on my journey through my lastest dating experience. I have no malicious intent. Rather, I want you to see what a terrific guy Dan is, and why I fell for him...and why it felt like the rug got pulled out from underneath me...and why I miss him...and why I must move on...in any case, thanks (as always) for reading and responding.  Yours,  Todd

        unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 13  March 8  Hey there Todd, I was busy working and realized your email had been received, and missed  the little Woohoo You Got Mail sound.. so try and imagine a pleasantly  surprised face to see Todd.. and an email created especially for me :) At  least I hope your not cranking out some copy and pasted words from god  knows where... OH yea, baby thats how like it. Um, where did that come from??? Well, I managed to read it before my friend stopped over to go to lunch,  how do these two hour lunches happen? Oh well, I work through many of them  anyway. I usually scarf down my food like I'd be a concentration camp in  fear it would be taken away and I'd go hungry before my nice shower. Ok,  perhaps not that eye opening, but I do eat fast.. We went to eat at Tick  Tock Tavern.. they have good ribs... yes, ribs.. I'm not obviously Kosher..  and not all that practicing of the Jewish faith aside from the major  Holidays. Also, had to stop downtown to pick up an extra mouse... I went up  with the window washers to see you through the window.. did you see me?.. I  might have been turning blue. but that was me... I bet you had no idea..  just looked right past.. should have been wearing my shiny shirt! Damn...  Speaking of stalking.... I DID drive by your house the other night coming  home from Scuba, just checked on my surveillance equipment. Nice houses  over there.. you live alone or have roommates? I enjoyed reading your email, getting to know about your background..sound  like decent stock too.. but may need to examine personally before I can  confirm that. I don't think I even dated anyone that knew how to give a  decent massage... my eyebrows (both) are raised! Your earning points left  and right. Maybe I'll just take you to the next Will and Grace, and of  course if your face is peering through my window longingly...teeth  chattering....blue lips... you can rest assure.. I will happily let you,  wrap a nice warm blanket, maybe my arm with a nice cup of cocoa... oh wait  lemme check if I have cocoa...will white mocha do? mmm actually a cup of  that sounds good right now. I wonder what your plans are on Sunday.. maybe  even watch Lady And The Tramp together..would that be an acceptable first  date? Maybe drinks in a bar first? I dunno.. what do you think? I know I'm  really enjoying getting to know you, emailing, and even a breif chat on the  phone.. I just get a cool vibe. it's cool and I'm smiling. So as I was looking over all your emails to me.. of which have continued  to grow .. but realize we haven't shared too many interests... so what do  you enjoy doing with your time when your not working? Do you like roller  coasters? Boating? movies? Swimming? Biking? Rollerblading? these are just  a few of mine... Tell me more, a want to know more... must I rummage  through your trash to find out more? I have a image from the movie Serial  Mom... ok - you must think I really am a stalker.. maybe of another  lifetime. I do tend to like psycho bitch movies.. Serial Mom, The Last  Seduction, Faster Pussycat Kill Kill...all of which I own. I own others..  hope I haven't thrown any red flags up for you. Well, I need to get some more work done.. so I will send this... and maybe  I'll be blessed with another correspondence from you.. hope your day has  continued to be great, glad I started it off well. Until later, ciao   Dan

        my big gay life [20]   My life just gets  bigger  and  gayer  by the minute. Last week, I went to that baseball game I was telling you about, and afterwards, we went to the Leather Stallion for drinks, right? Well, I didn't mention that I met a friend/classmate of Lee's (ex-love-of-life) from Podiatry School. So, this guy, we'll call him Red, gets real chatty with me. Now, understand that we're sitting out on the beautiful patio and that I'm pleasantly buzzed...and not really paying attention to a thing he's saying. I just get the feeling he's way more interested in me than I am in him. After enjoying my blissful-floaty feeling for awhile, I get up and take my leave...but not before he hands me a card with his name, number and address scribbled on it.  Whatever ,   not interested  . So, today I get a phone call from my best friend, Phil (who knows Red casually) who informs me that Red is totally Jonesing for the Todd, and wants to pursue it. Oy. Not wanted, not needed. So now, I have this guy interested...and I want no part of it. Sometimes I hate that about the universe...you're ready for someone to be interested, except for the person that is.   So, I attended the second night of auditions for  Chicago  last night. Lots of new faces and some really talented folks. I swear, there was only one other gay guy in the whole bunch. Callbacks are this evening, so it's going to get interesting. Also wrestling with the idea of auditioning myself...they need a Billy, and I could do it...but I'd have to resign as Co-Producer. Anyhow, it's funky no matter which way you slice it.

        my big gay life [19]   What is the musical theatre coming to? Last night at auditions for  Chicago , there were no gay guys to speak of. I mean, what's the point of doing musical theatre if there are no cuties around? The once exclusive territory of my tribe has now given way to untalented, unattractive hetero men with prostate problems. I ask you, where is the justice in this world? Anyway, I go back tonight to help out with round 2 of auditions, with callbacks on Wednesday night. At the very least, it keeps me out of trouble. This is a big week in my  big gay life ...what with the final few days of my twenties dwindling down. I face the big 3-0 with a little trepidation. I know that with the support of my friends (and a Gin & tonic) I'll be fine. Turning 30 is not so scary, it just seems that way. Maybe turning 30 doesn't necessarily equal death in the gay community. Maybe I don't have to plan to live out my days in my house overgrown with ivy and bushes...and with 36 cats running around.  [must shake thought from head ]    Note to self: go back to Outfitters to see hunky instructor-guy.

        unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 12  March 8  Good morning MR. Todd,  Glad you made it back from Grandmas house, I can just picture you  in the cutest little red hood. Actually, thats very sweet and in fact I  hold my grandmother in very high regard also. She lives in Columbus, so I  don't get to see her as much as I'd like to. I also have a Grandma here  too- on my mothers side. One is Jewish the other is Baptist (Columbus one).  Let's see if I can confuse you.. seem to everyone else... My mother is  Jewish, My real father is Baptist. I have a younger brother, but only half  as he was bagat by my mother and stepfather(who is also Jewish).. he is  Mike.. different last name then me. Then I have a older brother.. call him  step, his name is Dan too.. but was begat by a previous marriage from my  step father. No sisters unless you count Regina and Christy whom were  adopted by my real father from his new wife...on my fathers side... I was  only close with my Grandmother and Aunt( out near Ashtabula). I also have  an Aunt that lives here in Cleveland, my mothers sister, Rachelle - she's  cool.. and thinking about her right now, because I could really use a  massage! She is a licensed massage therapist with knowledge of foot  reflexology. Do you give massages? There could be major bonus points for  you here if you can...I give them  too, pretty good ones too... but will save that for another time. Ok, this  paragraph thought was intended to talk about family... I realized that you  separated your thoughts into nice little organized paragraphs with huge  spaces between them.. and I imagine my emails say BUCKLE UP, your going for  a ride on the head of Dan [name omitted]. I also have an uncle on my mothers side,  he lives in Paris with his wife and their 3 kids. So thats pretty much my  family and newly coming member from my older step brother's wife, Kate..  whom I adore worlds more then him.. is having a baby due in August, so I'll  be an uncle, just found out last night the baby will be a boy! So all those  loud toys.. will be seeked out by me for gifts... especially since they now  live in LA. My little brother is in CT, going to school at Yale, following  his goal to be a concert pianist. Why is a person who plays the piano  called a pianist but a person who drives a race car is not called a racist?  So how about you, tell me a little more about your family So of my family, I am out to my mothers side... Jews seem to  better to deal with things like that then Baptists.. plus they are not as  involved in my life now. I also came out when I was 17, at 18 - formed  PRYSM with a few other youth and facilitation of the center., birthdate Jan  16,1989. I know your younger then me, so did you not know about it or not  in the Cleveland area at that time? Did you grow up here? If not what  brought you to C-Town? My family is very cool with me being gay, and have  even brought Bf's to family dinner functions. Are you out to your family? Would you believe I have not seen Lady And The Tramp.. would ya  like to watch it again sometime with me? Actaully I've never been much of a  Disney fan, I don't think I've even sat through a whole Disney Annimated  movie since Bambi on big screen when I was little, aside from Toy Story,  and my favorite character is the 3-eyed alien , which resides on my car  dashboard.. your favorite part. Oh and by the way... I have located on the  web a warehouse of car dashboards, unfortunately they are all Yugo brand...  guess they had no where to go? Yea, Uncle Sam with tits, just doesn't work... you'd imagine a  Drag Queen would have done that as Aunt Sam(antha). The IRS, isn't one of  my favorite agencies though... I actually contemplated peeing on the IRS  building when I was in DC.. I had to go REAL BAD, when I was in town for  the March On Washington. At least I would have felt better for paying what  I did last year.. ugh..actually the trip to DC, was fun... not necessarily  for the whole Gay thing.. however an experience if you've never been.. but  mainly to get together with my friends who have moved from this fair and  fine city. Stayed with my friend David, and my other friends joined from  NYC, and Philly. The highlight was truly the HRC Equality Rocks Concert...  2nd favorite concert to date. It featured Pet Shop Boys, George Michael, KD  Lang, Mellissa Etheridge, Garth Brooks, many more and many presenters as  Kathy Nijimy, Tipper Gore, Kiristen Johnson, to name a few.. It really was  an incredible time. Well, I do want to thank you for writing me, a complete pleasure  to see an email from you first thing...you all ready have brightened my  day. Have a great day yourself.. if your not dragging ass.. get some  coffee... mm coffee.. sounds good, think I will do the same... make a pot  of Gevalia coffee..mmmm.. Have a good bit of work in front of me to do..  and still need to jump in the shower... then hosting a small get together  later, my friends and I take turns hosting Will and Grace night, including  dinner.. very good time. So, I will let you get some work done, although I  have a feeling.. you could just read on and on, like nearing an end of a  movie so good.. you don't want it to end... drop me a email when you get a  chance... is the next hour good for you??? Hey, I enjoy hearing from you  just as much!!  Captivated, Dan     At 01:12 AM 3/8/01 -0500, you wrote: Dear Dan,    Imagine my abject horror upon receiving the error message after thoughtfully completing such a gorgeous message...filled with humor, whimsy, wit and relentless charm. I wrote and wrote, and then wrote again some more. It's lost forever. However: Here I Am. Writing you at a quarter to One. Look at me! I am writing this while enduring the excruciating pain of a paper cut on my left middle finger. Ow! With every peck at the keyboard...wincing...every keystroke sending me reeling into seething pain. Okay, so I exaggerate.        I drove out east to visit with my grandmother...she's 93. We're very close...she helped raise me. I try to have dinner, or see her at least once weekly & call her every day. She's my favorite person on the planet. Then I raced out to Chagrin to do more grueling rehearsal. All the special effects seem to be in place tonight, and everything went off without a hitch. Now, if I can just remember my lines... ;)        I was glad to note that your emailing priorities are, in fact, intact. Numero uno on your to-do list is quite flattering. The truth is, I love writing to you, and even more...anticipating your response. Your emails are thoroughly entertaining & I do enjoy reading them and laughing out loud. You're right, I do smile when I see your name pop up in my In Box. I fear the people in cube-land around me must think I am mental...laughing at my screen.        Sorry to hear about the Uncle Sam situation...and thanks so much for the image of his tits which is now etched permanently in my mind's eye. I'm ruined.        Do you have a cold?        I'm sorry your ears were not burning. I could do a little experiment right now:    "Dan, Dan, Dan...blah blah Dan blah blah blah Dan."    Did it work? Did your ears burn?        I deserved those Sade tickets. They were rightfully mine. Too bad you had to it back with the riff-raff. I used my extra seat as a convenient place to store my keg. Nah, it remained empty. Had I known you were back there...        I had no idea you were involved with PRYSM. I wish I had something like PRYSM when I came out at 17 (late by today's standards, but still). How terrific! You should be proud!        Okay, about the whole Taurus thing...    it's true I can be stubborn, but not too much..and with that Gemini cusp thingy going on...I don't have a real sense of where I am astrologically. I find astrology very intriguing. So, Miss Cleo, if I give you my time and place of birth, you'll whip up a chart for me? ;) Interesting that you can guess someone's sign 75% of the time. Did you guess mine? I guessed you were an Aquarian.   Big Disney fan? Hmmm..depends. I had such a heinous experience with the tour of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST that the mere mention of the D-word made me twitch. After much therapy, I seem to be okay. It's just that...I loved "Lady and the Tramp" when I was little, and the Siamese cats were my favorite characters.        Yes, your email definitely made my day...and I hope mine manages to make you smile. I hope you had a wonderful evening, pleasant dreams and a great new day (as you read this).   Yours,  Todd

        unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 11  March 7    OH NO!.. you have really bummmed me out... theres nothing worse then losing  something that has been written, it just doesn't come out the same way  twice. So now I will wonder what words I have missed.. lost in the world of  electric pulses of 0's and 1's. Do you have any idea how rare it is for me  to receive a Fantastically Entertaining Email these days? I'm in complete  despair without a person to complain to.. oh wait.. I DO.. the creator of  the Internet - Al Gore! OHHH AHHHHLL. Actually their was a wonderful  advertisement I received at work one day.. top part had a picture had the  USA of what represented the internet network.. underneath, The Internet has  been proudly brought to you by Al Gore, the bottom half, a picture of the  Moon.. and the Moon and underneath is said the Moon has been proudly  brought to you by Network Solutions. Very funny... oh well.. maybe I get an  extra long email if the sandman isn't enticing you to a good night in  bed... have a good night, sweet dreams...  Mr. [name omitted] is lost until he hears from you again... dramatic shake of the  head looking into the sky sighing.. oh god thats GAY.

It was GREAT talking to you & getting your email. I will write back later...  UGH!  Best, Todd

        my big gay life [18]   Sorry it's been so long since posting, but with Blogger having tech. problems, it couldn't be avoided. I hope I can remember everything. Let's see...closed the show this weekend (finally), spent many productive hours in-studio with Doug working on new material, spent Mother's Day with Mom and Grandma out at the Homestead. We did the yearly planting/gardening/landscaping in the gorgeous clear spring weather. In the afternoon, Mom took me up to Newman Outfitters to poke around for birthday gift ideas for yours truly. I turn 30 next Sunday. Ack! Ack! Ack! Anyhow, while we were walking around the store...which is incredible, by the way (it has a testing/training pool for kayaks in the middle, a 25-ft. rock climbing tower and tons of other cool displays) we happened upon a  very  friendly and  very  hunky sales associate. He was chatting with me about how he goes backpacking and camping with his dog (a Golden Retriever, no doubt) and acting as guide & leader on some of the store-sponsored expeditions. Sign me up! When I got my mother's attention, I told her that   he   was what I wanted for my birthday...  In other news, my ex Joe sent yet another email. I finally had to tell him to buzz-off permanently...that I didn't want to pursue a friendship...blah blah blah. How irritating. I am looking forward to the weekend because Trish is coming in from Philly to help me celebrate my birthday. Then, on Monday, I fly out to NYC for work related meetings. So, it's going to be a busy and fun couple of weeks ahead.

       Again, it's the weekend. I've got my final two performances...the end is finally in sight! Woo-HOO! My parents are coming to the show tonight...I finally gave them permission. In one sense, it's been fun because the whole run is sold-out. However, I am eager to have my own time back for a little while before I jump into a new show. I know I want to spend more time in the studio tomorrow afternoon & spend Sunday afternoon with my mom. Right now, I'm really feeling like I'd like to have a nap.  yawn .

        unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 10  March 7    From: Dan    Subject: To Do list #429       Date: March 7, 2001 4:37:47 PM EST      To: Todd     429: Go back to #1   1: email Todd Stuart   Oh my god, you must be sitting there tapping your foot... where oh where  has the internet lost my email, actually if I could fudge the sending  time... I could have blamed it on the internet or the blahlink servers.. um  yea.. I emailed you first thing at 8:52 am.. you haven't received it  yet???? The pressure is on.. can I top my previous E's? Have I even been  trying.. actually no.. just being me. So, if this isn't good.. attribute it  to me now knowing how much I owe that bastard Uncle Sam.. you'd think he'd  at least get a decent suit! The Whole flag exploded is so 1970's wonder  woman.. and I certainly don't want to see his tits! Well I just imagine  your just smiling to see my name pop up in your In Box.. and not thinking  and cursing me out under your breath.. for my ears arn't ringing nor  burning.. actually a little cold.. so is my nose.. does that mean  anything??? Yea, it's a little cold in my dining room right now. Actually  I think I'm in better form to write you now then earlier after I did my  taxes and non stop working from email to employees on ICQ. Not to mention  the few friends that popped on and HAD to chat. Even though I was  sidetracked and skipped To Do # 1... I made sure I went back to it. Ok your last email subject was "Deer In Headlights" and right  now.. I'd run ya over for knowing you took my Sade tickets.. especially  standing next to a empty seat.. did you date a loser? Hey we all learn! And  no, I truly wouldn't run you down, that would make such a mess on my new  car. So I have been spotted before.. well thats nice to know... now that  you mention it, I vaguely may remember you at the opening of the new LGBT  Center on Detroit. Speaking of which is a much better space then what had  been housed on west 29th. Although through the many years since I was  involved with the inception of PRYSM .. it had improved. And now the gay  youth have a nice space in which to meet. It pleases me the group is still  doing well and helping youth in coming out. One thing I am very proud in  which to have been part of. Hey, one thing that most impresses me.. candid honesty.. and I  agree it is refreshing.. but also very important to me. Well, I'm sorry I  didn't call you earlier to arrange a lunch.. another time.. or a drink..  maybe something sometime this weekend when things slow down for you and you  feel more relaxed. I enjoyed the chat on the phone.. no awkward silence or  loss of what to say. Nice to communicate with someone equally as  intelligent via email or phone, I'm flattered by your compliments. Lever2000 huh.. you have that many parts? Thinking of that really  bad commercial..So your a Taurus, occasionally stubborn? actually your  communicative and mind seems to work very much like the Gemini air sign..  like that.. Give me your time of birth and place you were born... I send  you back a reading... SO.. your probably thinking... WHOA.. what next ?  Palm reading? Well the only think I can tell from that.. if it's red.. well  nevermind... actually, find astrology interesting and have many books on  it, but don't make decisions by it. Although it is occasionally fun to  guess someones sign... I'm usually 75% right.  Well you guessed where the names came from.. Are you a big Disney  fan or just know by profession?? Unfortunately they don't sing.. at least  when I'm around... who knows that they do when I'm away...but they sure do  speak.. as you heard the one is very vocal.. but both are super friendly,  many say.. they have a incredible demeanor for Siamese. Ok, it's 4:30...  and still some work I need to get back too... so I will make your day.. or  I have at least tried to make the effort to do so... as this is the most  fun thing I've done today, certainly not a chore.. or something I feel I  need to do.. but mostly WANT to do.. because I look forward to your  responses just as much if not more then you. Have a great evening... look  forward to hearing back.. sooner then my lazy ass took to respond!!  ciao, Dan    At 03:26 PM 3/6/01 -0500, you wrote:  Dan,  Pardon my delay in responding, I ended up in a 2p meeting as well.  Sorry to gush so much about your pics...but I like telling people what I think. Honesty is refreshing these days. Anyway, I'll drop it for now. :)  Yes, after seeing your pics, I seem to recall meeting you once at some LGBT Center thing. I was out on a sorta-date & didn't get to talk to you, really. And now that you mention it, I remember seeing you at Take 5...so, the shiny shirt wouldn't have been necessary...I already noticed you :)  The past 6 years in your career seem excitind and head-spinning. ^ moves...yikes! I've been lucky enough to have to move only twice since being here. My first office was in the One Playhouse Square building overlooking the parking garage and the lake (not bad!). Then, I was promoted to the Touring division, handling all the national tours, and I moved into the 8th floor of the Bulkley Bldg...nice office overlooking Euclid Ave. Then, they decided to start buying tons of buildings and we renovated the entire 2nd floor of Bulkley and moved there. Now I have a cube, no window, no door...do I hear violins?  Soap: Lever 2000 (this week) Sign: Taurus/Gemini cusp (Last day of Taurus) BDay: May 20 Pets: One dog, named Toby...stray...small (raised by a cat)  I love cats! I've never met a Siamese cat...are they like the ones in "Lady and the Tramp"? Do they sing?  Confession: I snagged your front-row Sade tix. I did have a slight advantage though, I worked in a Ticketmaster box office in college...so I had easy access...I did have an extra seat though, no one would go with me (my BF at the time lost MAJOR points...lol).  What are you doing right now? What are you thinking? I am thinking about how much fun I am having writing to you...and how I've managed to practically miss the entire ski season.  Todd

        my big gay life [17]  Last night was both  big  and  gay . It was everything I expected...and  less . It was really quite unextraordinary, actually. I met the guys at the Lizard as planned. It was teeming with hetero folks and a handful of the tribe. We drank a couple of pitchers of Killian's Red (semi-butch) and snacked on some appetizers (totally gay). The place got incredibly crowded and the scenery got better. Cuties everywhere! God, I love baseball! Anyway, deliriously buzzed, we walked over to Jacob's Field for the game. I was shocked at how amazing our seats were...4 rows from the dugout...close enough to see the players. However, we were also close to all the 50-something, white-collar pudgies who are the only people who can afford the $45 ticket price.  There, no more than 15 feet away, was  urlLink Omar Vizquel , object of my mad crush for 5 or 6 seasons. His pic in the link doesn't do him justice at all. Anyway, we all had a great evening at the ballpark...but it didn't end there. We all agreed to make a stop at the legendary and notorious  urlLink Leather Stallion . After another drink (they make 'em  strong  there) Pat, Jim, Phil and I all sat out on the patio enjoying the beautiful night. It was a great change of pace and change of scenery. Not a huge fan of sweet drinks, here. but the Stallion makes  incredibly narcotic  Long Island Iced Tea...just one will have your lips numb. Over the years, Phil and I have managed to get into tons of trouble with the LSS as our starting point. Last night felt like a reunion. Not much has changed there. But I have. It's hard to even remember the person I was back those 10 or so years ago.

        my big gay life [16]   Lord help us! Imagine, if you will, 3 gay guys and one gay-friendly...all descending upon the baseball stadium tonight to see the big game. There's something inherently comical about the 4 of us going to this game. I mean, my friend Pat is a total spaz. He refers to himself as a "Ziegfeld Girl," and it seems to suit him. I can just imagine him in the old days with Florenz working on his time steps or Buffalo shuffles. Anyway, we're going to the game tonight. Going to a game at Jacob's Field is the ultimate eye-candy experience...not only are lots of the ballplayers hunk-a-licious, but the 41,000 other fans (80% male) make the man-scoping ratio  very  attractive. So, the plan is to meet at The Winking Lizard behind the stadium at around 4:45 or 5pm. I won't get there until 5:30 because of work, but I'll just have to catch-up faster. I'm thinking a nice beer buzz would feel great on a gorgeous night like tonight. So, I think a night out with the boys will be just what the doctor ordered! I'm really looking forward to having a terrific night. I guess we have great seats, too....right behind the dugout along the third base line. If you watch the Indians game on television tonight, look for me...I'll be the tall, dark and handsome one squished between a Ziegfeld Girl, a Bear and the homo wannabe. Cheers!

        unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 9  March 6   From: Dan    Subject: Flattered       Date: March 6, 2001 1:50:06 PM EST      To: Todd     Todd, Oh Stop.. at least I think your saying I'm cute.. or you all ready  have a plot to snag my shiny blue shirt or you came across a bannana  someone left on the floor. Remind me to hide my silver when you come over  to my place. Now that you mention it, I'm refreshed by what you do and  where you work... and checking back, also see some other useful  information.. like a fax machine, work number... actually, my work  signature will accompany the end of this email too.. Do you know I used to  work over there by you for 4 years. Our office was in the Keith Building.  And I think I've seen you occasionally at the Take 5 coffee shop.. now I  know I should have worn a shiny shirt to get your attention!! All those  lunches we could have had. In December we moved our office to  Independence, and last week, moved from there to the corporate office here  in Mayfield Heights. Originally, the company named BlahBlahNet, was formed by my  brothers, and I joined in as a partner since Sep. 95 - working in a small  space, and office. Then we grew and acquired more office space, so move #2.  Sharing an office with the Marketing Director, I at the time was Account  Manager.. Then eventually became VP of Finance until we sold and another  office move.. my own :) Then when we sold the company and it became  Blah.net, I stayed on, became the GM of our Cleveland satellite office  and moved into the Biggest office. Then I worked on the transition of our  office to a sales office and was then again promoted to Integration  Specialist Manager. Then, our lease was up on the 8th floor, so Blahcomm  moved us temporarily to their office on the 18th floor, across from 104  FM., also the old office of our competitor ... sort of weird all being one  company now. Anyway that brings a total of 6 moves, whew.. going from a  small space.. to an office and now to a cube... I feel I have gone full  circle.. I'm glad my salary didn't go that way! So you probably wonder what  I do...or maybe you don't .. but I'll tell you anyway.. Basically I manage  the integrations of the companies we buy an bring them into our company  format. Cover many things from HR, seeing where people fit into the puzzle,  billing migration and consolidation, consolidating business functions,  dealing with everything to make a smooth transition of one company to  another. It's very interesting and certainly challenging at times, but I  enjoy it and I've gained a lot of experience and opportunity with sale of  our company. Okay, now that I bored you or lost you..one of the two... I'm sure  your asking where's this cool and crazy cat gone??? Well since my last  email was prolly a little much of a eye widener.. I thought I show you the  normal me too.. every thing in moderation I say. And besides...early  morning... everyone needs an eye opener.. I have a silly Zest commercial  running through my head.. is that Zest? Don't think it's Natural Spring...  hmmm what kind of soap do you use? And speaking of cat.. (I'm an Aquarius..  my mind is all over - what sign are you? When's your birthday?) you have  any pets? I have two, Siamese, both male, super friendly and named Si and  Am, however if you ever meet a couple named Dan and Mily, their names are  Kibbles and Bits.. I adopted the cats from them, but no good self  respecting gayboy could keep names like Kibbles and Bits.. come on, do you  blame me? So you know where the names came from? Ok It's 1:30ish now.. and  I'm partially ready for my meeting... may come back to this if I don't  finish... I did not drive by your house though, so I couldn't tell you even  the color, although now I can since you shared. Mines red Brick and my  walls are white, except for the muti colored panels in my dining room. I am  so jealous, I would have had front row seats too if Kaufmans ticket thingie  wasn't broken.. I waited, and ran right up as soon as they open the doors..  like a stallion at race..so frantically I drove to the nearest Ticketron or  whatever they're called, and got tickets but not as close as I would have  liked... and when I learned the first person got a front row seats, I was  one pissed boy... but the one good news that day is I actually got an extra  $20 from the ATM machine... only time in my life! Woohoo. Ok, I have 10  min. to prep for this meeting.. so I'll send this off.. I'm very much  enjoying our communique also, seems to make my day :) Thank you.   Dan    At 12:38 PM 3/6/01 -0500, you wrote:  Dan, I'm trying to find the right superlative to describe your pics. You...wow...I mean...after I peeled myself back up off of the floor...you're beautiful (trying desperately not to sound cheesy). Wow. Funny, intelligent and with looks like that...you're a triple-threat!  I was sure that 5'9" block of ice standing on the corner of Bridge and W.54th was you. I guess not...you just couldn't stick it out, could you? ;) You know, I did notice the little red LEDs on the surveillance cams...how did you manage to get all that rigged-up so quickly?? You're good...VERY good...  So, did you really manage to drive by and see my house? I live next to the big gay pumpkin house. In the morning, when the sun rises, the light reflects off of the side of that house and into my west windows, casting a sickly red-peach hue over everything and everyone. I told Buck and Mike not to do it, but there's no stopping them. After a few months, I managed to grow accustomed to it. Kelly, my friend and tenant, has to look at it through her window every morning.  Yes, I am an expert at raising a single eyebrow...you should see it sometime.  I only said dashboard because my dash is a beautiful combo of indigo and red...it's quite mesmerizing...all purple-y like that. I suppose I could have come up with a more thoughtful response, but I am kinda like a raccoon...I like shiny objects (which is why I like your shirt in that one pic).  I do think you are interesting and funny...and increasingly more attractive with each communique. (That besides being devastatingly handsome)  That Sade concert a few years back...I was in the front row center!! I hauled ass all the way back from college in Columbus to be there. One of the best live shows I have ever seen.  I have a mild interest in pop groups right now...sort of like watching a nasty car-wreck...I'm fascinated by this phenomena. Thru a contact at work, I went to both the Backstreet and NSYNC concerts...did the VIP backstage hoo-ha...it was a scream! Wrote an essay that I'm sending to Rolling Stone about the whole experience. Not my music of choice, though...I do love going to concerts.  Yes, my office is downtown, doing Marketing/PR...you remember that because the pics I sent were from my work email account. They had lots of other useful info embedded on them, too.  Good luck prepping for your 2pm meeting. I am heading off to lunch now, them back to work preparing the financial settlement for SCARLET PIMPERNEL.  Looking forward to hearing back from you!    Todd

        my big gay life (15)    ***messy tantrum advisory***      WWWWWHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYY?!?!?!?!  Why oh why did I do it?! I've been so good for an entire month...avoiding any internet contact with Dan...why oh why did I have to check out PlanetOut? Can someone tell me why it was so imperative that I do that to myself?? UGH! He's posted a personal ad...he posted it  today   , for chrissakes!   TODAY  ! My eyes! Oh, my eyes are burning...I didn't need to see that! I am such a dumbass! Why did I do that to myself? And while I continue to flail about on the floor like an angry kindergartner, dear reader, please understand that  TODAY  is exactly one month since I was kicked to the curb. Chucked out the car window. Sent to the city dump.  Wah!   To top it off...I was digging around in my duffel bag for the one thing that could soothe me: my NSYNC import remix CD, when I happened upon the greeting card he left on my windshield one night while I was at the theatre...I came out after the show and found it on my car...it was sweet. It had kittens on it.  Wah ! Alas, the "deep passion of love" just was not there and all of our collective words, thoughts and kisses added up to a whole lot of nothing. Well, not  nothing , exactly. I've experienced a whole heap of sadness.  Sigh . Kharmically, I should probably wish him happiness and peace and good luck on not meeting a whole string of losers (which he will, cuz it's the internet) but  fuckit!  I wish me peace and happiness...and valium.

        unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 8 , March 5    Todd, Stalking sure doesn't come without it's disadvantages... my toes  are still cold.. standing in snow waiting in the cold, the wind blowing  through my bones.. I couldn't stay much longer then 10:53pm.. so I guess I  missed you.. but I did manage to set surveillance cameras to see who is  going in and coming out. Your police and credit record check out.. so your  good there.. hey, I'm thorough in everything I do. And your place at 5216  Bridge Ave. is very nice from the outside. HA!.. bet your freaked now... especially if your records are  clean.. at least I'm hoping, lol...Love reverse lookup with a phone number.  Really, I'm far from psycho..but wouldn't that be the first thing a  psychotic would say?? Hmmm I may have to come with references. You do make me laugh though.. and I hope I do for you also....  hmmm.. do you still have a raised eyebrow? Can you do that? If was a good  stalker.. I would have all ready known what you had in your glove  compartment now wouldn't I??? So the dashboard is your favorite car part...  and I would think it would be a car part... although I doubt the have a lot  of extra car dashboards sitting in some car part warehouse.... so  interesting choice... why the dashoard? Let's see... the seat belt is a  good part.. keeps you safe...radio keeps you entertained, seat warmers keep  your buns warm (although don't have that yet), let's see my favorite car  part.. I would say the Key.. because you can't get in nor go anywhere  without it. Think I'm a freak??? lol - At least I'm interesting and funny..  if you see my sense of humor. I absolutely love Sade, in fact the concert 4 or 5 years back at  Blossom is still the best concert I've attended in my life. I even have a  couple remixed cd's of hers...one burned off from Napster, one purchased. I  have a varied musical interests... mostly female vocalists..and like a lot  of popular, however pass on the Brittney Spears, Christina Agularas, Boys  bands.. and that Celine Dion... Thanks for the pics.. guess it's my turn... and ya don't scare me  away and since my computer is still working, I can email you back. I think  I'll work from home tomorrow... so perhaps we can do lunch if your  available. Is your office downtown? You work for Playhouse Square? I don't  know if I read that or if it was something I had dreamed last night...  can't remember my dream... but for some reason it is in my head that you do  PR for Playhouse Sq.... although I don't see it in a previous email...oh  well. Well, I'm getting hungry.. I'm ready to eat my lunch early... so  drop me a line when you get a chance.. I have to prepare for a 2pm  conference call meeting.. that I may or may not have. I hope so.. because  the drive to the east side sucked!.. by the way... how was yours? your  drive home? hope you made it safely, and able to even read this today.  Well, I'll be anxiously waiting for your reply now.  Dan         At 05:36 PM 3/5/01 -0500, you wrote: Dan, I *did* get laugh out of your subject line. I agree that a corkscrew is an absolute necessity! You know what a horror it is to be anywhere and not be able to access the vino!! Wow! you have lots of stuff in your glovebox...everything except gloves, it seems. I have only my maintenance records and proof of insurance. I have no emergency provisions! I am a wreck! Favorite car part: dashboard, no question! IS that a car part? Well, if you were stalking me, you'd have some difficulty at the corner of W.53rd and Bridge because it doesn't exist...but my house sits exactly where you might imagine W.53rd would be...  You are a Sade fan?! She is one of my faves! I've been to both of her N. American concert tours...AMAZING!!! My musical tastes do not include country. Although, my sister seems to like it...  Well, I sent a few more pics...hopefully they didn't scare you off or crash your computer. All my pics are clean (just like me). Hope you had a safe drive! Be well, and I'll look forward to continuing this correspondence! You've helped make my day!!  Wish me well on a very long evening...if you're stalking tonight, I'll be back around 11p. I hope you have a wonderful evening, Dan!  Best, Todd

        my big gay life (14)   I have decided, after much thought, that going to the party this Saturday is probably not in my best interest. You know damn well he's going to go...if for no other reason than to see if I'm there. Although I am sure I'd manage to have a great time, maybe I really don't need the aggravation of dealing with Dan & related issues and feelings. So, better that I stay at my closing night party and avoid any possible "random" run-ins. I guess I'll know when I'm really ready to deal with being around him again, it has been a whole month, after all.  sigh...

       Received another email from friend Patrick regarding this Saturday's benefit/party. It seems that I should really make an appearance, but it is closing night of  Le Grande Specticale Theatrique  and I will be expected to stay for the closing night party. Perhaps when that's wrapped-up by 12:30 or so, I should put in an appearance at Brooke's. What do you think?  urlLink email me

Waxy Mess huh.. try lighting only the wick ;)  Actually I don't have candles in my glove compartment either.. and I think  I still haven't replaced the wine opener I used to have in there.. NOW  thats a Necessity!.. Never want to get caught stranded on the side the road  with a uncorked bottle of wine!... Actually they have come in handy to the  many parties I have attended with an owner without a damn corkscrew.. I  hope you own one... if you have an extra.. the glove box would be a good  place to have one, along with a tire gauge. I've also been told a  screwdriver, however I've never needed one. Let's see what else do I have  in mine.. asprin.. for the roadtrip from hell... umm a flashlight with an  extension to see a hard to reach area... let's not delve further there...  um...handy wipes, purell oooze.. supposedly cleans... just a few things  that I can recall .. how about you??? whats in your glove box? What happens  to be your favorite car part? Bridge is just about bridging Detroit Shoreway.. isn't that really  Parma? lol Well, I would prefer to say Franklin Clinton Historical  District, but it may sound a bit pretentious... so Detroit Shoreway, really  says it all, lol. So, if I were, say to be a stalker... it be safe to find  if I'm standing on West 53rd and Bridge?? hmmm will you look now and think  of me??? So, I didn't know you were the Napster Librarian... I'll have to  check out whats on your hard drive and see what there is... and of course,  looks like I'll have to show you mine ;) Although since we moved our  office, I think I'm blocked to download... so... no more taking advantage  of that sweet T3 connection. You earn points for listening to SADE, one of  my faves. I like Macy Gray too... wonder your other music tastes... I hope  none includes country though. I think you'll have to send me some of your pics, I was asked for  an adult ID Password when I went to the webpage... are they that racey? do  they involve wax? If they are, you can hold those back... since I certainly  don't have any of the like to trade back with you. But I have some more  pics, also.. clean, like me. Well, time for me to go and sit in traffic... ohhhh yea. Did I say  where I worked? I'm in Mayfield Heights, in Landerbrook... just lovely  cubes. I suppose I won't get a response until either later or tomorrow.. so  in the event I don't 'chat' with you... have a good evening and night.

I live on Bridge Ave. between W. 52 and 54. Just shy of official "Ohio City" designation...I prefer to say Detroit-Shoreway...it confuses the hell outta people.  Candles in the glovebox...I think my mom told me to do that. Do I also need two pieces of flint to rub together to make fire? Somehow, I think lighting candles with the cigarette lighter would just be a waxy mess...  I am finishing sending out some press kits for the national tour of FIDDLER ON THE ROOF due here on the 20th. I am a little caffeine jittery too...listening to some borrowed Napster tracks of Sade and Macy Gray...but I am a huge dance music fan...it might push me over the jittery edge today, though.  Yes, I have more pics...you can find them at: cuteandnormal.com/todd.htm funnysweetandsexy.com/trs.jpg  just kidding...  I can send you more, if you like  xo Todd

I'm writing you obviously and listening to some dance music I borrowed  on Napster... do you know how I give it back... so confusing....  ;) Actually I'm gonna be bummed when they shut it down, I won't be able to  get all this great music. Anyway.. have a good day if I don't get to hear  back like by 3:45pm... ;)  Later, Dan  p.s. you have any more pictures?

        my big gay life (13)   I received an invitation via email today from a good friend inviting me to a party this Saturday to benefit the local Lesbian & Gay Community Service Center. Immediately, I remembered a comment Dan made weeks ago about being CC'd on the same emails, but never really knowing each other well. He wondered how many times had we received these group emails from our mutual friends without even knowing it. I say this because we are both recipients of today's email. So, the question that begs asking is:  do I go to the party ? I am fairly certain he'll be there if for no other reason than the slight chance I might be there. I'm gonna need help with this one. What do you think I should do?  urlLink email me .

        my big gay life (11)    Yesterday was incredible! A total gift! The sun was high and bright, and the temperature remained a very agreeable 70 degrees. Our hike lasted just shy of 3 hours, and we were delirously exhausted by the end of it. We drove into Peninsula to have an early dinner at The Winking Lizard, and then drove back to the city, sated. I took a shower, dressed and went over to DVDave's for the weekly Queer As Folk party. We're watching Further Tales of the City until QAF comes back from hiatus in a month. All in all, a really terrific day.

        my big gay life (10)     the big gay prom: a wallflower winces    Into my life, enter a little melancholia. This weekend is the annual  urlLink HRC  Dinner. It has become known as "Gay Prom" because it's the big formal event of the year for the gay and lesbian community here in Cleveland. It also happens to be one of the biggest-grossing and most successful HRC dinners anywhere in the nation. Go figure. Anyway, it's the event where all of Cleveland's gay and lesbian glitterati and glitterati wannabes don their best duds and head downtown for a big fancy-schmancy evening. I've been once, when I was still on my weekly radio show  The Gay 90's ...and I was there more as a media personality. I guess this one just stings because I know Dan will be there & there was a time when we had planned to go together. I know it's probably stupid for me to feel that way, but I feel really left-out and left behind. I feel like the nerd who never got asked to the dance. Although, I won't be sulking at home with a pint of Ben & Jerry's. Oh no...I'll be performing in that theatrical extravaganza in Brecksville. Sad.

       Visiting Michelle last night doesn't really qualify as "my big gay life" but I watched the final episode of Survivor with her and a few old friends. Now, I haven't even seen a whole episode, ever...so I was completely in the dark. Naturally, I had several witty remarks to make during the screening - much to the delight of the straight folk seated in my vicinity. That Colby is a looker!  Don't mess with Texas!  I was rating each of the competitor's relative gayness. Thus far, I'm convinced that Maralyn, Jeff Varner, Mitchell and (possibly) Colby, are all gay.

        my big gay life (9)    what can I say? It's Friday and life is good! It's time, once again, to go back to the theatre tonight to perform the concert to a sold-out house. Maybe we can insert some sort of Latin/Mexican number into the show in honor of  Cinco de Mayo.  And, no, I won't be wearing any fruit baskets on my head. I guess it's safe to assume that my ass will be in the studio a lot this weekend. This recent validation of our work is going to kick us into high gear with our writing, production and post. So, I guess it's a good thing that I don't have any boyfriends clamoring for my time right now. Funny the way the Universe works, huh?

       okay, update on the song thingy...Doug says that this firm sells songs to various producers and labels...they get about 4 million inquiries a year, and have about 72 songs currently collecting royalties. So, it's kinda like having an agent. They have the material...they try to land it on an album...we all try to make money. Just to have made it to this point is mind-boggling. More updates as they are available...

        Amazing ! I just received a voicemail message from Doug. Apparently, our demo CD  Swamp Yankee  landed in the right place. A music publishing firm in Nashville has optioned the rights to two of our songs  Missed The Train  and  Count On Me . I'm not quite sure what all of this means, exactly, but Doug will explain the intricacies soon enough. It's so wild to think that someone in the large corporate music industry machine actually optioned the rights to something I wrote. It's such a cool feeling!!! Yay me!

       Last night, I ended up back in the studio mixing and mastering the final edit of  Sorry ...which totally smokes. It's sultry, sexy and resigned. I love it! I also had the chance to do a rehearsal take on  say the perfect thing  which is a difficult song to sing, technically. It's very demanding, and I need a lot more rehearsal before I attempt another take. Let's see, what else? Heard from another boy (whom shall remain nameless at this juncture) who wants to get together in a week or so when he's in town. The universe is weird when it comes to guys.

       I have a feeling that this evening may be set aside for writing. Not too sure what the weather's going to be doing, so maybe I'll just grab my notebook and head up to the coffee house to write. I feel like I have another song or two swirling around inside me. God knows, I should get those out and make room for more.

       Things all come around. Full circle, I mean. I've been thinking a lot about my friend, Michelle. She and I met when we worked for Sea World in high school. We went to Ohio State together, competed on the speech & debate team together and lived together for two years. We're not as close now as we have been, but we're still close, none the less. Anyway, she called today and invited me to her place for a fun little get-together with some of her family and friends. I am going to go for several reasons...one being that I want to catch-up, but I also want to do something with different people...which this will be. So, interesting opportunities do present themselves...usually in the darkest moment when it feels like you might actually be bored and depressed to death...a shift in direction occures. Oh, plus...some firm in another city/state is after me. It's great to be chased!

        my big gay life (8)    I had a wonderfully relaxing dinner with Phil last night. Phil is one of my dearest and closest friends. He was the first person I came-out to...and he was the first person to take me to a gay bar and introduce me to lots of other gay people. So, we go  way  back. Anyway, I was able to fill him in on all the gruesome details of late, and he brought me up to speed with his life. Mostly, I can't repeat it here because he'd kill me and/or get arrested. This morning, I arrived at my desk to find an email from Joe waiting in my inbox. Well, let me tell you...this one was a  gem ! I think he may have been drunk. Saying how he wants to have another chance to get to know me, another chance at friendship, etc. All I can think is:   go away, psycho!   Boys are stupid. They leave you, then they want you back...well...I ain't a yo-yo.

        my big gay life (35)       a big gay update       God, I have been so lax in the MBGL department. Its almost as if the warm weather just saps you of any creative energy. I haven't had the urge to do any major writing. However, just because it's been warm, doesn't mean I have nothing to catch you up on...     Trish came for a great visit this past weekend...Kelly went off to Colorado for a vacation (Todd is left to his own devices at home now muahahahahaha!) and rehearsals for  Chicago  are going at full-tilt. I spend most of the day just feeling exhausted, but we only have two more weeks of rehearsal. So, I'll either be in really great shape, or dead. Either way, I get a rest! Not too much going on in the romance arena, not that there's any time, mind you.  I am jonesing to get back into the studio...I've been absent for way too long. Doug had a great conversation with the publisher who wants to pick up our stuff...he currently only represents about 75 songs and gets over 400,000 inquiries a month...so that's very respectable exposure. I'll update you as I learn more. Well, this being my first and only early night...I'm going to sign off and say goodnight!

          in search of Eric...   When I was at college at The Ohio State University in the early nineties, I had the opportunity to work with the newly-formed Writing Lab, a co-venture between the English Department and the Communications Department. The premise was simple: develop a writing center where students of all abilities could develop their writing skills together, without the traditional Graduate Assitant/Teaching Assistant in the mentoring position. It became known as the Peer Writing Program, and I had the distinct honor and pleasure of helping develop this award-winning program with a handful of other students, staff and faculty. One of my favorite memories is of Eric Walborn, a PhD. He was in his late thirties and had a luminescent personality and an absolutely killer smile! He had sexy salt and pepper hair, which he coiffed with styling mud. The summer after my freshman year, we presented a paper about the Writing Lab and the Peer Writing Program at Penn State. I remember only shreds of it, but I do remember an evening walk around campus with Eric after everyone else had returned to the hotel. We walked down the well-worn pathways and empty sidewalks together...hands and arms brushing against each other ever so slightly. The air was humid, but fragrant and delicious. At one point, I sat up on a low brick wall outside one of the buildings. Eric came up to me. Slowly and gently, he began kissing me. It was one of the sweetest, most heartbreaking kisses I had ever experienced. We could never be together, and we both knew it. I think the excitement of kissing the forbidden fruit (so to speak): professor and student...even though I was not in any of his classes...he still was a faculty advisor with the Writing Lab. When I returned home for the summer, we chatted on the telephone once or twice. Our sweet moment was over...and all we could do was remember. We saw each other occasionally on campus over the next year or so, but eventually, our paths ceased crossing at all.  Flash forward eight years.   I decided to try to look him up. He was no longer listed in the faculty directory at OSU. I searched until I found an obscure reference to a handful of people who had received awards named in his honor. I searched a little further..only to find that Eric died in 1993, a few months after our paths stopped crossing. I'm not sure what the cause of death was, but I suspect I know. I was deeply saddened by the thought that I was on campus for two years more without knowing he had passed. But, I will always remember the writing and I will always remember his kiss...warm and sweet on my lips. He kissed me as he was living, not dying. He kissed  me.  There is no greater gift.  There is no greater gift.  To Eric, my dear, sweet friend... thank you.  I love you. Godspeed...

       Okay, so maybe this year's concert wouldn't have caused me to launch my blog, but it was a great show! It was my first visit to the practically brand-spankin-new Cleveland Browns Stadium. It really is spectacular! We had club level seats, so we were in the first deck looking down onto the field & stage. The club level seats fewer people and has amazing amenities...like a gorgeous bar overlooking Lake Erie, plenty of restroom facilities and lots of friendly staff to assist you at every turn. The show itself was much better than last year's  No Strings Attached . Somebody who has a theatrical clue must have been in charge. Some of the new material sounds terrific...quite a surprising departure for them. In any case, we had a great night!! No, there was no gratuitous cruising last night, but if I had been at the meet and greet...well, that might have been another story...

       hello, again! Sorry it's been awhile since my last posting, but things have been crazy! My friend Trish is coming into town for a wild weekend of drinking & nsync-ing. Yes, it's that time again - time for us to make our annual pilgrimage to the NSYNC concert. Last year, the experience caused me to launch my blog...so the implications are enormous! In any case, i'll be thinking about you all & hoping you are well! I hope to post at least once this weekend. Have a great one!!

         Missed the Train    	Maybe it's just a myth, or a made-up bit of magic to quiet an anxious child. No matter...I believed it. Mama always said that if you drive over or under a bridge while a train was passing, you could make a wish. I thought of this as I was barreling down the Shoreway one evening last week. I just needed to get out, drive around and give myself the chance to think. Sometimes it feels like there are just too many pieces of information clattering around up there. I get all confused about what to do and what to think, I just need to drive...fast.   	I left my house on Clinton and drove west to 49th. I looped around until I saw the city spin by and butterflies fluttered in my stomach. Why was I so nervous...so anxious? I hadn't smoked a cigarette in weeks but I felt the same tar-laden anxiety as if I had just taken a long drag. I sped onto the Shoreway, the hum of the motor vibrated through my car, rattling the flimsy shell of aluminum, plastic and glass - and my nerves. 	I straightened the car out on the long clean line of road ahead of me. I accelerated swiftly, passing the rambling old laundry truck to my left. Out of the corner of my eye I could see the old man in the truck's cab shake his long, bony finger at me as if to say " crazy kid !" As I cleared ahead of the other drivers I relaxed for the first time in hours, it seemed. My fingers uncoiled from their relentless grip on the steering wheel. I relaxed at high speeds. Never look back. Pick a direction and...zoom...get there!     	Rising above the thick black asphalt was an ancient train trestle built of solid mortar and stone cut out of the nearby hillside. The 9:13 was passing over on its way to Ft. Wayne and then Chicago. I remembered what Mom said about trains and wishes and good luck. I stepped on the accelerator and the trestle became larger as I approached it.  	The boxcars were rusty reds and browns, clickety-clacking as they sped across the track right to left. There must have been a hundred cars, an ugly brown blur, metallic and quick.   	"You'll have some of that good luck if you make a wish when a train's passin' by," she said.   	"How's a train get you good luck, Mama?" I asked.   	"Why so many questions? It just does. Train's goin' somewhere you ain't never been. Maybe you'll be lucky enough to see those places if you wish on it."  	"I guess so, Mama."  	She said, "Ain't no guessin' about it!" smiled and tousled my hair.   	 From that day on,  I never forgot to make wishes on passing trains. Maybe it did help me. I went to college, got my degree and have a career. Maybe all those wishes got me my car, my house and my swanky friends. But it never found me happiness. No... that  had eluded me time and again. I was always chasing after it, keeping ahead of my own dissatisfaction.   	I shook the whole scenario from my head has I approached the trestle, now looming close before me. Maybe this would be my lucky train. Maybe this wish would change my life forever. Maybe, just maybe, there was something new on the other side of the tracks. My heart raced as I felt the rumble of the boxcars on the track. I could hear the metallic thunder race above me. And, as I passed under the trestle it was shockingly quiet. I had missed the train. My car shot like a bullet from under the bridge. In my rear-view mirror I could see the last car slip out of sight, red warning light blinking, taunting me. And as I watched the train speed on, I wondered where I was going. Maybe I did miss the train. Maybe I was headed in the wrong direction. I could hear Mama's voice in my head, "You can't just stand there waitin' on another train, there'll be one tomorrow, boy. You'll catch it. One day you'll catch that train. Of that I am certain!"   	The road beneath the car felt solid and I was hungry for it. I accelerated toward the interstate west where the gentle, rolling hills gave way to the flat of the Northwest Ohio farmland. I sped on the turnpike toward the Indiana border, and I knew by early morning I would find the 9:13...and make another wish.

        my big gay life (34)   Well, today I'm officially one month into my 30th year...and so far, so good! I've managed to keep any laugh-lines, crow's feet and other facial maladies in check. Free as a bird and having a blast!! Yesterday, I managed to zip through a ton of work before heading out to a board meeting in Chagrin. Afterwards, I had rehearsal for Chicago. We've blocked and choreographed all of Act One, and Act Two gets done tonight. We're all having a great time with the show, and with each other. Can I tell you  one more time  about my dismay at the lack of homos in the musical theatre lately? It's discouraging. Where are they? Watching football? I'm way overdue for work in the studio. Doug should be back from California any time now, and we need to hit it hard. I haven't managed to write anything significant lately, a fact that is mirrored in my blogging activity. Forgive me, but I am going through a dry spell. I hope to be wet with inspiration soon enough. Also, Earthlink is still experiencing growing pains as Mail.com is upgrading their email servers. As of today, I still have no access to my archived email folders, thus, no  unravel in 58 . I hope we can get going with that soon...I'd really like to get it over with...

       Lots of fun stuff going on at work today...lots of little details and loose-ends are finally getting wrapped-up. I love when that happens! Rachel and I took a nice walk over to the Galleria for lunch. We sat outside in the blazing white sun amongst all the beautiful people who seem to work over in that quadrant of the city. After a quick stroll through the mall, we meandered our way back to the office and the cool, dry air conditioning.

       Let's see...yesterday was absolutely crazy for me. I went from work right into our annual company meeting and awards dinner. After three hours of the requisite schmoozing, I raced out to Chagrin for what was left of my Act One blocking rehearsal. I got home around 10:45 and crashed into bed. After a nice 8 hour slumber, I started all over again today....meetings, rehearsals and (as of yet) no yummy glazed doughnuts.

        my big gay life (33)     tedious/strenuous    Life out on the town did wonders for this weary soul. The opening at the Center was quite fun and included the usual array of characters...my friends and accomplices from work and a few other folks from around the way. I drove Rachel and her friend Erin. The night was muggy, sticky and heavy with the scent of the early summer blooms. The Center for Contemporary Art was cool and clean, light wood floors and the air scented with expensive perfumes. I ran into a very old friend...someone from my neighborhood where I grew-up...I knew I recognized the face, but couldn't place him. Will! Of course! Will Baker...from Eastview. Right! He remembers me teaching him vocabulary words on the school bus. He was in second grade and I was in fifth. He remembers me teaching him the words  tedious  and  strenuous  words that have, no doubt, come in handy in this life. What a trip to run into someone from so long ago.  Fifth grade...  Afterwards, the party  moved to Touch Supper Club...which included much more drinking and even some dancing. I returned home somewhere around 1:30 (I think) and crashed into bed.  Yesterday was Cleveland's Gay Pride festival downtown on the harbor. We had gorgeous weather...clear and 72 degrees...no humidity. Maggie joined Toby  and me for the day's festivities. We walked along all the booths at the festival, drank lemonade and watched Judy Tenuta do her 45 minute set. I got nicely sunburned and managed, thank god, not to run into too many exes.  whew!  Afterwards, we joined Kelly and John at Johhny Mango for a light supper and drinks. We moved that party to my front porch where we were joined by the infamous Dr. Tom from across the street (always amusing). Like teenagers, we drank beer and played "I never..." Today, Kel and I ran a few errands before each of us headed off to celebrate Fathers Day. Dad was excited to know he got to share his big day with Gay Pride...he's so cool. My dad rocks!!

        my big gay life (32)    I have to admit it to you all: I am working my way through a small wave of Dan-related depression. I just feel like I need a good cry. Sometimes I never understand why it happens, but today's seems to be rejection-related.  Maybe waking-up not feeling good was a factor...but for whatever the reason I feel down about it. I think my plans for the evening will help refocus my energy. My crew from work are all going to a new show opening at the Center for Contemporary Art, and then to Touch Supper Club for drinks and dancing afterward. The temperature and humidity here has been beastly. I just got my hair cut, and I'm waiting for my shirt to dry before I head out. I just wanted to say hi...talk to you all later. xoxo

       The clouds looked ominous this morning as I stumbled out of bed...not actual clouds, mind you...but the fake scary ones I conjured in my head. Anyway, I woke up with a slight headache, which worsened as I approached my office. I drank lots of water and popped two aspirin to see if I could slay the beast before it debilitated me. I lost. Sitting at my desk going over my morning's agenda, a wave of nausea hit me. I grabbed my theater key and let myself into the darkened and quiet Allen Theatre. I raced up to the mezzanine level men's room, and arrived just in time. Thankfully, I had nothing in my system this morning except water and two asiprin tablets.  Note to self: this is not a great way to start the day.

So, I am gonna sit here for awhile until something GRABS me. Thank you for your patience with me, really. I don't deserve you.

       Well, summer has finally arrived in Cleveland...temperatures soaring into the 90's and blazing sunshine. We're usually there by mid-May. The temperature of Lake Erie is typically 72 degrees by now, is still hovering at a chilly, hypothermia-inducing 57 degrees...so there's some catch-up that has to happen before any of us plan on going swimming, windsurfing or waterskiing without a wetsuit. When I worked at Sea World, I think we kept the water chilled to 58 degrees for the whales, dolphins and sea lions' optimum comfort...and we all definitely had to use wetsuits then. Last night I had a rehearsal for Chicago. We worked on the chroeography for  All I Care About Is Love  which looks like it's going to be a great number! I was so happy to discover that my vocal distress is almost gone, and I am once again nailing everything in my mid & upper range. I keep drinking lots of ginger tea which causes lots of sinus relief and drainage...I feel pretty clear for the first time in weeks. On a sadder note, my friend & surrogate brother, David Kammerman, lost his mother this week, quite suddenly...she apparently had some major malfunction with her spleen. I have memorial services for her tomorrow. My friend Sally Suren just lost her sister Pat yesterday after a courageous battle with cancer. While expected and prepared for, it is never easy. I have services for Pat on Saturday and Sunday. As for the rest of you...behave, treat each other well, love each other a little more, and take time to acknowledge the abundance in your lives...count every single blessing...

        my big gay life [30]   I had a great weekend, I did...I did lots of stuff outside...actually got some color (which looks  good , by the way). Rachel and I really enjoyed the show on Saturday. Afterwards, we went to Johnny Mango's for a drink or two and a bite to eat. Sunday was a day of cleaning, shopping and more sunbathing. I got nothing major accomplished, except weeding my flowerbeds.In the evening, I decided to stay at home to watch  urlLink Sex and the City  and  urlLink Queer As Folk  with Kelly and Rachel.

        my big gay life [29]       Well, here I am two months after my little break-up episode with Dan. I can say that I am thankful for all the friends (old and new) who have leant their support and offered observations, humor and the services of their Uncle Vito should I need a certain someone to "disappear." In any case, it's been a wild and unexpected journey over the past 61 days or so...and I'm glad you were all along for the ride. My life has definitely moved in several other directions  away  from Dan, and I've met some really fantastic people, like Steve G., Charlie!!, Jody and John. I'm also lucky to have my guys at D.A.S. who love and amuse me on a weekly basis.  Okay, enough of that...   Last night, my friend John and I went to the Cinematheque to see a screening of  Plaster Caster . At first it seems like an intriguing idea...this groupie from the sixties goes around making plaster casts of various rockstar penises. Except, besides Jimi Hendrix, there's no one of note. This documentary chronicles Cynthia's preparations for her first big NYC gallery solo exhibit. Along the way, we meet many of the guys she's cast, and are forced to listen to punishing boring stories for nearly 2 hours. Ack! Avoid this film  at all costs!  Today, the sun has finally come out of hiding and I spent a good long time out in the yard soaking up rays...I'm so white...it's pathetic! I need color,  damnit!  Tonight, I'm going to the theatre to see a series of one-acts called  All In The Timing  so that should be fun. No, go out there and have a terrific day, alright! Go on... get outta here!

       When I got home tonight, I nursed Kelly back into tip-top shape...made her a little carrot/apple/grape juice and her hangover headache disappeared! We took Toby for a nice long walk down at Edgewater Park. We all enjoyed the scenery...men on rollerblades, men on bikes, men walking, working-out and playing football. How I love summer. Tonight, I'll work on cleaning my room and finishing up some laundry. Tomorrow's a half-day at the office, so I'll probably work in the studio in the afternoon. Friday evening is another matter altogether. Will there be a date? Won't there?

        my big gay life [28]      Twenty-eight is my favorite number. No reason...I just like it. Anyhow...yesterday was a long one...so, by the time I got home at 8:30, I was ready for a cocktail or four. I rallied Kelly for a night out. We headed to the Market Avenue Wine Bar for a nice quiet, relaxing bottle of wine. However, by the time we had guzzled that into oblivion, we decided we needed to visit the Parkview Niteclub for Blues Jam. So, we headed over to the deliciously seedy nightspot in our neighborhood and took up residence near the bar. A high school friend of Kelly's was the featured performer. Kelly got completely (and enjoyably) schnockered, while I played designated driver. She flirted recklessly with a County Prosecuting Attorney (who clearly spent way too much on hair products) who, in the end, left without her number. When we arrived home near 1:00am, we played a lil Fleetwood Mac before heading off to bed. What a weird night...although fun!! Not very gay, but this is what happens sometimes. It can't all be glamour, glamour, glamour...but I can try.

       I once went to Studio 54 in Las Vegas...I was invited to Tommy Tune's birthday party. He was in EFX at the time and I found myself in the faux recreation of the legendary nightclub, surrounded by the oddest bunch of celebrities. Paul Reubens (aka Pee Wee Herman) tried to cut in front of me as we waited to pass through the velvet rope. I know it  sounds  like a dream, but it really happened...

        unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 28  March 15  hey Todd, Funny to see our names on the same email, as you were just asking  me about Dan Kxxxxxx - we get an email from him ... Are you thinking about  going to the party for Paul after your show? Sounds like a plan after the  movie Saturday night. I wonder if I had not said hello ? Think we might  have met at this party coming up Saturday night??? So you liked the  allusion.. I guess I had the movie YOU GOT MAIL in my head... but it's so  prevalent in so many movies. Some of the movies I am going to see that I can remember off the  top of my head are Big Eden, Nico and Dani, River On Your Right, With a  Friend Like Harry, and Wet Hot American Summer, Oooh, I named them all. Busy day here, although your email did make me smile, and happy  I'll see you later.. I took a mini break and am now burning the ATC CD. I  looked to see if I had the Sade Remixes on my computer.. but looks like I  removed them.. I was going to burn you a copy since Sue's computer where  the CD burner resides, is finally working right now. SO I have the Duncan  Sheik to burn along with Nelly Furtado. If you'd like a copy let me know..  I'll bring in my Sade Remixed Cd to make a copy for you also. I even had a mini lunch today, made a Turkey Sandwich and bought  some new Kosher Dill Potato Chips... like Salt and Vinegar with dill  added.. salty, but yummy. Do you like Salt and Vinegar Chips? What are you  favorite? How about your favorite movie candy? Do you buy it at the theatre  or the nearest CVS ? Do you even eat during a movie? So whats up Friday night? I would love to see you and I don't have  any plans.. I know your working, however would love to see you in action,  plus the play sounds like something I'd enjoy.. is it sold out? Do they  take AAA discounts? uh oh.. nevermind, I lent my card to my friend Dan as  he drove to Atlanta, just in case he got a flat or something.. it's good to  have, especially on a long trip. However, if it's possible.. we could grab  something to eat before and perhaps something after if your not too  exhausted. Just an idea.. Well, I hope your day is going great.. mines moving right along..  great.. just got the Muppet song in my head.. I think the very song I sang  in a high school play I was in.. I was Gonzo.. thats as far as my  theatrical bio will show... Speaking of the Muppets.. I was bored one day  and took many of our company employees pictures from our company employee  intranet page and matched them up with their Celebrity Counterparts.. quite  funny actually.. some matched up too well, like a Miss Piggy and Animal.  Tom, who you will meet as we pick up, has reminded both me and Dano of  Ralph the Dog, as he bobs his head up and down, especially when he laughs..  keep an eye out ;) p.s. he knows this.. He said I'd be the Sam the Eagle..  not sure if I see that.. don't really know who'd my cartoon celebrity  counterpart would be. So look around you.. do you see any people that could  have a cartoon counterpart? Well, I better get some work done.. I should be home by 6pm.. so  come over anytime after that.. would like to leave my place at 7pm though.  Food is being provided, however if you want beer - we'll need to pick some  up.. have a good rest of the day.. drop me a line if you get a chance..  otherwise I will see you later :)  yours, Dan

        my big gay life [27]   Don't laugh. I did go buy a juicer last evening. Ha! Totally love it! Now I might just have a fighting chance at getting the recommended daily amount of fresh fruits and veggies. I retired early to my bedroom...caught up on some reading before drifting off into a blissful sleep. I've been slogging thru  We Were the Mulvaneys  by Joyce Carol Oates. Not a barn-burner...but beautifully written, to be sure. I'm enjoying it for many reasons...that it takes place in the Chautauqua Valley in New York (a place I love), it deals with a semi-rural farming community not too different from where I was born and raised...and that it's an extremely thoughful piece. It's also one of those  Oprah's Book Club  selections...now  THAT'S     gay   ! I'm looking forward to reading a few of the books I received for my birthday...several of which are books I've wanted from my Amazon wishlist. Fortunately, I have family members who are internet-literate enough to make purchases via Amazon. Until last year, many of my family members (who shall remain nameless) were using an abacus...so we've pulled them kicking and screaming into the late 20th Century...hopefully we'll get them into the 21st here pretty soon. What else? After a great night's sleep, I took a long, hot shower, readied for work, played with my pooch Toby and clocked-in at 9:30. So, all is good...not necessarily fabulously exciting or entertaining...but good.

       There is always time for random babbling. Maybe there's not been enough of that lately, and for that, I apologize. I've been worrying about my recent dryspell in the lyrics/composition department...I've learned, however, not to force these things...they tend to emerge when they're good and ready. Not sure what tonight's plans are, but I'd like to go buy a juicer, or go see a movie. I'll be spending time in the studio doing Post work tomorrow evening, and who knows what on Thursday. In any case, I'm feeling neither prolific nor profound. Please excuse my verbal clattering for today.

        unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 27  March 15    WOW Todd, Your email just knocked me over - your thoughts came out so eloquently that it became such a lovely poem.. and by it, I'm touched - as it brings such a warm feeling and a smile that just show's I've been WOWd ! (and if it wasn't meant to be a poem - I almost feel unworthy) I don't think I could even attempt to reply so well to give you the same feeling that just came over me... Your emails are such a wonderful thing that I've so much enjoyed each day, and have just as much wanted to talk to you, because I enjoy hearing from you just as well. I smile, that tomorrow.. which may be today when you read this and in actuality - it will be tomorrow in 8 minutes. Confused? I think I did myself! LOL.. ok point ... I get to see you and I really enjoy your company as much as everything else. I like growing and getting to know you in the way we are. I ran into Dan Kxxxxxx today, bought my tickets for the film festival, and he's working there. And I mentioned you, as you've been on my mind.. Thinking and also sharing how funny that we've seen each other, and know so many of the same people - yet never "saw" the something very cool in each other.. I'm glad we finally have..sort of the image of like in so many movies.. two people cross paths everyday, the viewer is like God, and of course knows the fate of these two people.. and finally they bump just right. This bump brings a wonderful smile and with every communique my heart warms more in getting to know you. So, to answer perhaps the thoughts that became such a beautiful poem, and I'd love to read more.. as you continue to impress me, So I am awake.. and smiling and responding at this late hour when the sandman is taunting me to bed.. however.. just that compelled feeling that makes me really want to write you and give you that first early morning smile, because as much as I enjoy reading whatever you have to say even if it is "highly NOT entertaining...just dull and informative" [email] ... I want to bring you the same smile and happy feeling so I can get more (does that sound selfish?).. guess you intrigue me. I guess the whole point of what I'm trying to say? My thoughts are of you too. I hope you have had sweet dreams.. I know you will be on my mind as I fade into deep sleep.. and when I get to work.. maybe an email will pop up just waiting for me. Have yourself a wonderful day..

When I write, there's always the thought of someone or something, rounding out my sentences...tonight, that's you. I hate when I don't have enough time to say whatever I want, to revel in the luxury of thoughfulness, turning ideas and questions around in my head...somehow smoothing them before they come tumbling out as words. I wonder. I wonder, my friend, about your day, things that happened, or didn't, things that struck you as funny or poignant. I wonder what you think and what you feel about...anything...just because I like learning about you. For me, night is contemplative. Its when I ponder and ruminate and process. But, mostly, I smile, looking back at the day, thankful for the events and the people that make up its contents. This is just to let you know you were thought of today, nothing more and nothing less. Sweet, sweet dreams...    yours,  Todd

I had a French bread pizza and a yogart. Whatcha doing tonight? Not sure here.. have to return that movie, buy tickets for the film festival, and prolly work out too. Uneventful here, although sort of noisy, I'm getting a new roof today. Scuba class was fun, although got quite workout, had to swim 12 laps non stop, the tread water for 15 min. Then we donned our gear, masks, fins and snorkel and learned some moves... They just need to light the squares at the bottom of the pool, so I can be John Travolta. Like to trip the light fantastic with me? Do you dance? Would be fun to go out and dance with you sometime. So you still have some questions unanswered from previous emails, you mentioned your writing on the way back from Omaha, but didn't say what it was or about. Well, your probably busy... but I'm still very interested. I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow night. I really love to hear form you.. write me :)  patiently waiting to hear from you,  Dan    09:59 AM 3/14/01 -0500, you wrote: Hi Dan!

It sounded like you got home late, too. I had to go pick-up Toby from the parents' out in Aurora. In the meanwhile, it's chaos and mayhem revolving around our Disney announcement yesterday...lotsa news coverage and lotsa phone calls coming in. I have a lunch scheduled today, otherwise I would have loved to have met you. :)   xoxo Todd

        my big gay life [26]    The thrill and excitement of the Tony Awards has subsided. Life continues on. Where do we go from here? Well, for me, rehearsals are going well...still managing to sing thru my vocal troubles, and things are improving every day. I hope by week's end to be rid of any/all remaining detritus in the vocal cord area. Both my NY peeps (Steve and Charlie) got to go to the Awards at Radio City last night. No word from Charlie yet. For me, my immediate future holds a semi-interesting board meeting. No potential dates lined-up for the week...even though I have no rehearsal til next Sunday! I'd better open up the lil black book and get crackin'! My friend Michelle asked me to join her for the Jimmy Buffett concert on Thursday. We've gone before, and I'm sure we'd have fun. Maybe I can invite a boy along.  Who  will it be?  Who will it be ?

Yes.. one of  those wonderful things that download to my email program. Woohoo...  although I'm imagining you caught in a Disney Hurricane.. Si and Am  clinging for their life by their clutching tails as they spin around..  Nala, Simba, and Mafusa whipped about confused they did the wrong dance  (had to do a little research on Lion King characters) .. oh well..  hopefully you are keeping your ground and will get all your p's and q''s in  order by 3pm. I'm glad you'll come Thursday.. I kinda all ready made your plans and said  I'll be bringing another Todd. Sort of funny, my friends name is Todd, and  there's another Tod we know too, Plus a Jerry and another Jerry, and of  course a Me and another Dan (although he is Dano) - Dano is MIA - somewhere  in GA. He'll be back by Saturday.. as we have some films to see at the Film  Festival.. you of course will be working.. but maybe catch up with you  sometime after for a drink?? We'll see. So on Thursday we'll pick up my  friend Tommy then off to Todd's in North Ridgeville. As long as you are at  my place by 7pm, that will be great.. that should answer the time and  place. Come earlier if you like. I don't and hope you don't feel I'm being  presumptuous about making plans for you.. but I think you'd enjoy and have  a good time. I like you and at least would love you as a friend.. more to  come slowly. I feel comfortable with you and I DO think your attractive  too, just don't want to jump into anything fast. You not only make me  smile, but also blush, not to mention you do give me warm fuzzies.  XOXOXOXO Dan

        my big gay life [25]    Quite glamourously, I spent Saturday night  in  for once, discussing Charlie's Tony Awards outfit. He's going to look spectacular, I tell you! But, don't take my word for it...ask Fran Weissler! Anyhow, yesterday was really a lot of fun. Some old castmates from  The Wizard of Oz  and I made an appearance at the  Relay For Life  in costume. I never thought I'd be wearing that 40-pound hunk of metal ever again...but it was for a great cause, and we actually had a great time. I was worried, however, about rusting-up for real...it was misty/rainy all afternoon. I don't know if there's anything  gayer  than dressing in Wizard of Oz getup...do you? Okay, so you're wondering if I'm going to mention anything more about all my date requests this week...no. Today, I have to do the mundane shit: grocery shop, laundry, clean...etc. I also have a rehearsal for  Chicago  which will cause me to miss the Tony Awards...am I in danger of having my card revoked by missing the Awards? Can I do any Gay extra credit assignments? Should I kiss a buncha boys? Alphabetize my showtunes?

        my big gay life [24]   Suddenly, I am gaining market value. It's a great thing for the bruised ego, really. I am bewildered at the sheer number of times I have been asked-out this week. What's going on in the cosmos? It's not that I even have interest in most of them, I just found it, well, odd. Don't get me wrong, it's fabulously flattering...but after the 4th person called me up and asked me out, I started laughing (not AT him, mind you). Anyway, when it rains, it pours. I'll keep you updated...

        unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 20  March 13   Hi Todd, To my complete surprise, I come home from a long workout and a  busy day from work.. to get a message from you from Omaha and Minneapolis,  plus and email before you got home... You definitely made my night, and  brought a huge smile. Actually I'm really glad you called from Minneapolis,  because after your first message from Omaha .. you put the horrible image  of iced prop planes going down in some cornfield in Omaha.. without a damn  candle in the glovebox! Should you survive but end up dying of frost bite.  After your first message it was all ready in my mind to have you call me  once you got home - no matter what time you strolled in. But fears were  calmed with message number two.. although I was hoping from a call from Ed  McMahon calling to tell me he missed me to give me my big check. So Omaha is a real place?? It's not like a world from the "Truman  Show"? Your description sort of sounds like it or a science project of  some sort, or an Alien Colonization... come on 100 democrats!!! YIKES!. You didn't respond about Thursday? Would you like to join me to  Will and Grace night? If you feel uncomfortable, thats cool, I understand.  However, it's a good group of friends and I think you will like them too. Well, drop me a line if you get a chance.. I'm in the office  today.. not sure if I'm working at home this week yet. sort of play that by  ear. Going to Lunch with my friend Brian since my parents are too busy  today to take me to lunch, hehe... Hope your having an happy day back in  Cleveland, I'm glad your back and that you weren't held captive by those  Omahaians.. I would have hated to have to experience Omaha in effort to  bring you back home.  ((HUGS)) Dan    At 11:35 PM 3/12/01 -0500, you wrote: Dear Dan,  Fresh off the plane at Hopkins, I started composing this email, feeling horribly neglectful - that I could leave this city and not be in email contact with you. But that's they way of it in Omaha. And while the offices I visited there had nifty high-speed internet, I decided not to try and email from there...not wanting the wretched boring-ness of it all to creep in to my email to you. How can I describe Omaha? I haven't yet figured it out...such a strange place. I think I was the only person in the entire city wearing a tie today. This morning at the "Burger Lust" Diner, this trailer-trash woman was all sarcastic with me saying, "Niiice tie..." Whatever. Odd folk out there. There may be only 100 Democrats in all of Nebraska, and I think I met 10 of them. Otherwise, everyone's SUPER-CONSERVATIVE. Imagine, if you will, the largest office "tower" in downtown...the "Woodmen" tower...named after this right-wing uber-Christian insurance company. Just looking at it gave me the willies. Yechhhh! Anyway, the downtown districts are completely void of people, activity and places to go. In short: I hated it. Now, I am not a metro-snob. I love cities. I love the country. My best friend growing up lived on a working dairy farm...I've milked cows, for chrissakes, but Omaha was the worst of both worlds. Dead downtown littered with odd gentlemen's clubs, half-rate hotels and rundown office and retail storefronts....and a business/industry area dominated by Con-Agra, Swanson's and a meat-packing plant with lines of cows headed for the slaughter. And, it was all beige and gray. The land, the buildings, the people...the whole mood. I felt (by 9 am today) that I needed to run screaming back to Cleveland. I almost put on my cross-country running spikes and set of in an Eastward direction. The most excitement is east of Omaha. Know what's east of Omaha? Iowa. Woo-hoo. Oh my god, pack-up my house and get me to Nebraska! I have seen the excitement & I must go immediately. This is, of course, to say nothing of the business end of matters...which was very intriguing and an otherwise wonderful opportunity. But, in the end, I don't think he was really prepared to hire me under my conditions, so he lost. Anyway, upon take-off in out twin engine jet-prop, I breathed a sigh of relief, knowing I was getting out of Omaha...even if the wings iced-over and we took a nosedive into a cornfield, I knew I wouldn't be stuck in Omaha. It was a very weird "other dimension" kind of trip...feeling like I was in an alternate reality...a really boring one. Needless to say, I am ecstatic to be home. THank you again for your kind emails, they definitely made my day! I haven't stopped thinking about Saturday & smiling. I look forward to reading you, seeing you and speaking to you in short order. I'm going to bed now, exhausted, to dream of lighter things...here's wishing you a wonderful day.    yours,  Todd  xoxo

        my big gay life (49)   Back from whirlwind weekend. I was house and kitty-sitting for my folks while they were on vacation. I even managed to get her medicated properly (you cat owners know how much they love pills and oral syringes). Two shows this weekend, a charity softball game and a nice relaxing evening in my own home last night. I had fun at the softball game because I got to see a couple friends I haven't seen in awhile. I also got to help my friend Margaret move (for the 2nd time in 3 months). I really like her new apartment, but I didn't like moving her piano up to the 2nd floor. I still feel like I haven't caught-up on all the sleep I didn't get this wekend...and I wish it was due to something more fun than house-sitting in the middle of nowhere. I get to do the house-sitting thing again next weekend at my friend Phil's house...but he's a smidge closer to civilization.

       This weekend, I'm house & kitty-sitting for my parents who are going on a lil vacation. I always look forward to heading out to the old Stuart estate in lovely Aurora, Ohio, because it's way out in the middle of nowhere and because a change of venue is almost always a good thing for a few days. Other pluses include a fully-stocked refrigerator and liquor cabinet and access Mom and Dad's cars so I don't have to put more miles on the trusty Jetta...I like to give it a vaca sometimes, too. So, I get to go spend quality time with Emmi (the cat) and eat/drink my parents out of house and home. What else? Oh...over 97% of the respondents believe that the James Taylor concert was, in fact, a date. Thanks to everyone who emailed! In other news, I will keep you updated on the current sales progress of  urlLink NSYNC's  new album  Celebrity . Everyone is biting their collective nails wondering if it will top last year's record-breaking sales. I haven't slept in 3 days...

        my big gay life (48)   So, when is it called  dating ? In theory, say you had this friend, and this friend went to the James Taylor concert with another friend. And, after the show (which was really good, by the way...) this friend and the other friend were driving out of the parking lot, and one of them grabs the other's hand...net result: hand-holding. And let's say, for instance, that the hand-holding continued on the 40 minute drive home...well, not home, but to an all-nite diner for some pie...and then again home from said diner. And suppose that when home one friend said goodnight to the other, pecked on the cheek and went home. Supposing all of this happened, would you be inclined to call it a date?  urlLink vote

        my big gay life (47)       the big gay draught...      The last time temperatures reached the upper nineties and Ohio suffered a horrible draught was in the summer of 1991. Not to say some summers weren't almost as bad, but 1991 was unrelenting and unforgiving. I remember it clearly because I worked outdoors then. I was a narrator in the Education Department at Sea World of Ohio. Our staff of 20 or so high school and college kids worked all season long at the various animal exhibits, giving talks, answering questions and maintaining the safety of the animals and guests. In a major theme park where 90% of the total surface area is blacktop over asphalt, the temperatures rose quickly to uncomfortable levels...and stayed there well into the night and early morning. I can remember standing at the Back Holding Pool at Shamu Stadium at 12:30 AM and feeling the heat pour off of the pavement. The dolphins, whales and sea lions were the lucky ones...nicely chilled saltwater kept at a cozy 58 degrees year round. It always struck me as ironic that I was living through a major draught that summer, exposed to the harsh sun and heat, yet surrounded by MILLIONS of gallons of chilled saltwater... so close, and yet so far... .  My six summers at Sea World were comparable to summer camp. The kids who worked there were all pretty tightly-knit. We worked hellacious hours together, we partied together, and some of us even slept together. Day in and day out, 16 hour day after 16 hour day...we'd wake, jump into our uniforms and report to work...for weeks on end with maybe one or two days off in a month's time. Somehow, it didn't matter much. Going to work was also the center of our social universe...so the lines between work and play became very blurry. Add into it that the guests we served were vacationers...and the whole atmosphere began to feel a little like Margaritaville. Someday, I will write the book I've been threatening to write ever since I left Sea World. I've got enough stuff to guarantee myself a nice lawsuit. Someone remind me to do that someday, okay? Anyway, the temperatures here in Ohio are back to that stifling upper end of the thermometer. There is no water, there is no breeze...and there are no boys. I call  draught!

        my big gay life (46)      Sunday already. The weekend seems to have passed so quickly. I had two performances and a wedding. Today, I'm going for a nice long hike with Kelly. We're headed out for an 11 miler this afternoon. It'll feel good to get out in the woods...back to my country roots, y'all!  Not much new to report, so I'll keep this brief. Maybe I'll check in later.    Okay, so I'm back from the woods. What an amazing journey. Do you know what it's like to be in the deep woods where the foilage is so dense, it seems like dusk at midday? My hike today was through very rugged, very deep woods terrain. The 90-degree heat was tempered a little by the dense vegetation, but the humidity was stifling. We hiked through steep ravines and forded over 8 or 9 streams. The water levels are low due to the summer-long draught we've been experiencing. I was reminded of my days at Camp Lejnar (Leh-Nar) every summer from 2nd grade thru 7th. I was an expert in orienteering...which is to say...getting myself back outta the woods with no more than a compass and a canteen. Imagine being 8 years old & dropped in the middle of the woods and being expected to find your way back to camp. I loved the thought of it...and I won first prize every time. Something about trusting my intuition at a very early age. Anyhow, hiking the Buckeye Trail today reminded me of trusting myself, following my own path and arriving at my desination with little more than the shirt on my back. It reassured me that I know how to find my path, and that I am not afraid to walk it...alone or with friends...we always get to where we're going.   Namaste...

        my big gay life (45)     life is a plum...    Anyone who lived in Cleveland during this city's greatest streak of insecurity will be familiar with the "failed BIG like the Titanic failed BIG" city motto/catchphrase:  If New York's an Apple, Cleveland's a Plum! . So...Cleveland's a  plum ?!?! Anyway, I was thinking about that this evening as Neighbor Thomas presented me with the gift of a home-grown plum...only the second piece of fruit off of his plum (tree?) (bush?). I thought the gesture was quite sweet. Let me give you a little background on Thomas. He arrived in the neighborhood two years ago as the first set of townhouses went up across the street from my house in what was once a fallow field. And even though I appreciate the major leap in home value the project added to my abode,  I missed seeing the giant belltower of St. Stephen's over on W. 54th. Thomas was one of the first of the five owners to take occupancy. He's always been a wee bit awkward...not necessarily shy...he's got all sorts of opinions, but he's not ultra-social with anyone, it seems.  Sometimes in the past he reminds me of that gopher-thing who, if he sees his own shadow, harkens 6 more weeks of winter. Lately, he's really become a lot more social with Kelly and me...visiting for porch parties and the like. Last weekend, he even came to see  Chicago  with Kelly. So, tonight he stopped over after work and handed me a plum as we chatted about our plans for next week's concert. Sometimes it's the little things. I am struck by life's simplicity. Funny...just now as I am typing, I can hear the bells chiming over at St. Stephen's...and even if I can't see it anymore, at least I can hear those beautiful chimes...Life is good.  Life is a plum.

        my big gay life (44)    random babbling and other detritus...   So, I have to say that the Stevie Nicks concert was fantastic! The old girl still got it! She's sounding great (due to lack of illicit substances and smoking) and her tech was gorgeous, too. She opened with  Stop Draggin' My Heart Around  (no, Tom Petty didn't show up as special unannounced guest) and then moved into  Rhiannon  and  Stand Back . Then she went into a buncha new songs from her most recent release "Trouble In Shangri-La." She, of course, had to kill me with her final encore  Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You?   I am looking forward to seeing James Taylor next week with my across-the-street neighbor, Thomas. That will about do it for my tour of 70's Rock Legends. Tonight after work, I am going to go take a nice long bike ride in the park...it's been awhile since I've been able to just jump on the bike and go...so I am looking forward to it.

        my big gay life (43)   I had to take a bit of a break after the posting-frenzy on Monday. I just wanted to button-up the whole  unravel in 58  series. [note:  tongue planted firmly in cheek ] Whilst certain folk grew nauseated, rolled-eyes and gnashed teeth at the thought of slogging through all that syrupy-sappy text,  urlLink Andrew  suggested sticking the reams of text on a separate page as its own thingy...and still other folks like  urlLink Charlie  couldn't wait to delve further into my former misery. In fact, my favorite bit of feedback is from Charlie who said, and I quote, "Thanks for sharing all of that, I hope it gave you some perspective and opened you up for whatever's next. " Or better yet, "That boy wasn't smart enough for you. There you were putting your feelings down in words he didn't deserve and he was giving you back a watered-down version of what he thought he might be feeling. And apparently his "feelings" don't come with spellcheck." I almost fell off my chair laughing. Thanks to Charlie for making my week!! I have designated him as my  Official NYC Boyfriend , to whom I will be monogamously committed-to whilst ever on the isle of Manhattan.    In other news...I am going to see Stevie Nicks tonight out at Blossom Music Center. My friend Kevin gave me VIP backstage passes and backstage parking, so Kelly and I are in for an incredible night. Now all I have to do is find some fringy shawls and date Joe Cocker.

        my big gay life (42)    razzle dazzle 'em   I started my somewhat dubious non-professional career in the theatre in the 2nd Grade when Mrs. Finnick pushed me out center-stage as a fuzzy pink bunny rabbit in some (now secularly inappropriate) Easter pageant. Thus began my love affair with the theatre, and pink fuzzy footie pajamas. In any case, tonight is the official Opening Night for Chicago. And, I must say, I am particularly proud of this show, this company and everyone involved. So, as we careen ever closer to 8:00 P.M. EDT, wish us the best...as we all attempt to break our legs.      give 'em to old razzle dazzle  razzle dazzle 'em  give 'em a show that's so splendiferous  row anfter row will grow vociferous...  give 'em the old flim-flam flummox  fool and fracture 'em  how can they hear the truth above the roar?  throw 'em a fake and a finagle  they'll never know  you're just a bagel  razzle dazzle 'em  and they'll beg you for more...

        my big gay life (41)    oscoda songs   My sister was ten and I was six when we first felt the sugary sand of Lake Huron's shores beneath our feet. Our parents had rented a cottage at  Cherokee Trails , a now defunct cottage resort in Oscoda, Michigan. Every summer for more than ten, we trekked to northern Michigan to spend time on the beach, play tennis, swim and enjoy nightly bonfires on the beach. These are among my favorite family memories. There were five cottages at Cherokee Trails, and the Stuart family always rented #4. We started going there because some close family friends had been going for years. Well, one week at the cottage sold us for a lifetime! There was beach volleyball, shuffleboard, tetherball, adirondack chair swings, cook-outs, Sunday morning Bloody Mary parties for the adults, fishing...the list goes on and on. We all had different interests. Dad liked to ready trashy espionage paperbacks, swim and drink scotch cocktails in the evenings. Mom like to play volleyball, read Prevention magazine, play tennis and go on random shopping excursions. Mom was also fond of exploring whatever and wherever possible. Jennifer, my sister, liked swimming, tetherball, boys, volleyball, campfires, cookouts and cards (oooh! alliteration). I loved all these things, too...including the boys. I have particularly fond memories of walking up US Route 23 to the "7-Up Store" to buy candy and wildly exciting (and tame) incendiary devices like sparklers, snakes and smoke bombs...always an endless source of summer entertainment. I loved to play Canadian Doubles tennis with my parents...and visiting the Greenbush Library which was adjacent to the tennis courts. Swimming in Lake Huron was always a nippy proposition, but it never seemed to really bother us. We'd bodysurf in the waves and we loved playing on the old metal slide sitting about 30 feet out into the lake. We'd make ambitious sand castles and sand sea-creatures. I remember that we always met and made new friends every summer...there were always new families each year vacationing there. I always laugh when I remember what a treat it was to go into town and go shopping at the Ben Franklin (much like a Woolworth's)...or watching the town ready for the annual East Tawas/Harrisville Art Show, or even "Paul Bunyan Days." Don't Ask! I think of all these things and smile. Eleanor and Homer LaGassey owned Cherokee Trails. He was a former Air Force pilot and a very talented pen & ink artist. One of his works hangs in my house, now...the very print that adorned my room in the cottage, as a matter of fact. Homer put the resort up for sale shortly after Eleanor succumbed to Diabetes. I made a pilgrimage to Oscoda a few years ago with Mom and Dad just to check things out...to see what it all looked like. Not much had changed, except that the resort was for sale and empty...but it was all there. I found myself with the sugary white sand beneath my feet. Caught in the swift undertow of not-so-distant memories...it all flooded back, the sun, the laughter...and the peace. Like the morning after a particularly heavy rainstorm, we found the entire beach covered by millions of ladybugs...the sand was deep crimson for as far as the eye could see. Time goes on and everything changes, just a little. I am going back there someday...if just to walk on the shore, or to visit Greenbush Library, play tennis or remember being six years old. Since I'm of age now,  someone save me a Bloody Mary...

        my big gay life (40)    summer, poppits and Grandma   Today (July 11) is my grandmother's 94th birthday. She's quite a lady! She was a flapper girl in the 20's...frequenting speakeasies with her boyfriends back in the day...drinking bootleg and whooping it up on the dance floor. As a matter of fact, she was engaged to be married to some other chump when she met my grandfather, George. She saw him and quickly slipped off her engagement ring. Pretty sneaky, Gram. Anyway, she's a real hoot & my favorite person on the planet. I was lucky to have grown-up with her living in our house. She was a constant presence in my life from my earliest memory until she moved out when I was in 6th Grade. Summers were always special, and she would supervise the daily activities of both my sister and I, and several of the other neighborhood kids. Casey, Dane, Elkie, Libby and Chrissy were among the close friends who loved Grandma. She would keep an eye out as we played endless games of kickball, tag, statues, kick the can and bloody murder. Libby, my across-the-street best friend spent many hours together. She and I would play other games, too...like "Little House on the Prairie." She would be Laura and I always played Mary (snicker). Some things never change. My grandmother was also quite stealth in getting us to eat our lunches. Why is it kids never want to eat? As an adult, I have yet to pass-up a PB&J sandwich. How about you? Well, back then, she would cut off all the crusts (naturally) and then dice the sandwich up into about 16 bite-sized pieces called "poppits." I believe she coined this term and patented the process. In this way, sandwich-eating became fun. Perhaps not as much fun as pulling my glass away as she poured milk or juice into it. This was always my favorite prank...I don't remember her reacting with the same level of amusement. Now, at age 94, she's still as sharp as ever...but has more difficulty moving around in her normal spritely way. Now it's my turn to make poppits for her...she likes her food in small, easy-to-consume bites...and I take to the task quite joyfully. You can be sure that I am keeping my wits about me as I am sure one of these days she's going to pull her glass away as I fill it with milk or juice.  Happy Birthday, Grandma!

        my big gay life (39)    on Ryan Lyden...and being my best friend...   Sometimes I feel like nostalgia hits me like a brick wall. I can be anywhere at all, and something will trigger a flood of memories, feelings and pictures in my mind. My best friend growing up was this cat named Ryan Lyden. He was the coolest mutha-effah in the whole of Kenston's kindergarten class. I've never seen anyone bewitch a classroom full of 5 year-olds like he could. My mom taught at my elementary school...First Grade. As per District regulations, I was not allowed to be in her class, but you can bet she had something to do with having me placed in the classroom right across the hall from hers. Mrs. Larkins (rm 14) was my teacher...and one of my mother's best friends and cronies (ha ha...just kidding Mom!). Our class and my mom's (Rm. 15) often did things together, so I was often supervised and/or within eyesight and earshot of my mother...more than the District would probably like to know. But what golden days those were! There was nothing better than having my mommy down the hall, across the hall or around the corner for my K-2 years at Gardiner Elementary. The one, and only, downside to all of this is: she knew about everything I did, said and of course...all of my test scores (point of note: this didn't change all the way thru high school graduation). She often knew my grades and scores well in advance of me. This is  not a bonus  in most cases. Anyhow, Mom had Ryan Lyden assigned to her classroom...so I got to know him quite well, and by 2nd Grade, we were inseparable. I spent hours with him every single day...balancing carefully my time with my other close childhood friends, Adam buxton and Rick Doxey. Remind me to tell you about my across-the-street best friend Libby Baker sometime. Ryan and I would spend after school hours together, do sleep-overs on the weekends, Cub Scouts...you name it. We had a whole posse by the time we reached Auburn School and the grown-upness of 3rd Grade. Let's see, we had Paul, Doug, Chad, Stephanie, Carrie, Ryan, me, Brett and Robbie. I'm sure there were other hangers-on, but I don't remember them. We carried-on like best friends and brothers until his family relocated during our 6th Grade year. I remember that he moved on December 10...to Kansas City, Mo. Shortly thereafter, they moved to Farmington Hills, Mi., and then finally to somewhere in New Jersey. He visited me once in 7th Grade. I have never seen him since.  I haven't seen him since 1985 , and yet I still call him my best friend. I think about him a lot and have tried to find him to no avail. Anyway, all this flooded back a few days ago when I heard that cheesy 1980 song "Steal Away." All I could do was think of Ryan, and of growing up happy, with a best friend. I guess my abundance started early.

        my big gay life (38)    Okay, I am definitely feeling it today! Anything remotely connected to my elbows  hurt  from the workout yesterday. However,  after a few ibuprofen and some mash liquor, I seem to be feeling fine! Last night, Rachel and I hosted a rather impromptu porch party...complete with big citronella candles, Rolling Rock beer and munchies...pizza arrived later. The Bridge Av. porch party is always a guaranteed good time, and a great way to welcome the weekend! Today, I did a few chores 'round the house and went to go get the car washed. In a few, Dr. Tom (from across the street) and I are going to go biking down by the Ohio & Erie Canal towpath. I am going to go spend some time in studio with Doug tonight, kind of a nice catch-up before I head into tech week with  Chicago . I'll be back later with tales of lust, love and intrigue from the trail...

        my big gay life (37)      I am barely able to type this. My whole upper body is numb from a new workout designed especially for me by "Don" who is one of the trainer/consultants at my new gym. He assures me my upper bod will be wracked with pain tomorrow, but that I should be completely mobile again by Sunday. Ack! Well, I will say that I like my new gym a whole lot more than my old one...this one actually has helpful staff and lots of equipment. Don was impressed with my cardio stamina (ex-cross country runner here) but he noted very quickly that for all my endurance training...I am a blank canvas when it comes to weight training. Following Don's instructions to a tee, I came home and popped down some X...er...ibuprofen. Thus, we begin my journey. On my quick ride home, my thoughts turned to food, naturally. I thought it might be a good night for authentic Mexican. I guess we'll see who's up for some fun tonight....      That's it for now, kids...I'll be back later...feeling chatty.

Don't forget! The big, exciting conclusion to the series happened April 9th, so stay-tuned! It won't be long now! In the immortal words of  Queenie  in   Show Boat    "Misry's Comin' Around." As for the rest of you, just skip over it. I'll continue with  my big gay life  for y'all.

        my big gay life (36)   I have spent the better part of the week hyper-caffeinated thanks to my good friends at  urlLink Starbucks . This level of caffeination brings one a certain level of clarity (so I've heard). I've yet to discover it. We're all back at work after our one day respite. I think of my friend Jennie over in the UK enjoying her summer. She quit her job a few weeks back, made a quick trip to the States, and is now back freelancing and sleeping-in a lot. In a recent email, she said that she's been catching-up on her sleep (that's rough) and spending lots of time down at the pub. Huh. That sounds pretty good to me right about now. Let's see, rehearsals have been going well...grueling and often running late into the night. However, we are making great headway and having really way too much fun while we're at it. This week's challenge is to find a cool pair of spectator shoes (black and white wing tips) and to drill the brand-new choreography for  Razzle Dazzle  into my head. Nothing spectacular going on personally, but that's really quite alright. Oh yes, Miss Kelly returned from her Sabbatical to Colorado...she's in love. She wants to move to the Rockies and marry her a big, burly mountain man. So, in the next few weeks, I'll hopefully be helping her prepare for the big move...she seems so happy and excited by it that I hope she really follows-through with it. Anyhow, back to the daily grind for me. Hope everyone had a happy 4th. Talk to you later...

        from Keith...(via Rachel)   Hello dearest readers,      I have discovered that there are simple principles one must follow from time to time during ones career.  The following is a compendium of rules that I have experienced in my early career within the non-profit sector.  These principles are interchangeable with careers in the for-profit sector.  It is my hope that you can concur and shake your head vigorously from a north to south direction at all of them.  Some of these principles, I may practice from time-to-time, as may you.      I fully understand that most of you enjoy my short anecdotes that I write from time to time; however, once in a while it is far more interesting to be cynical and crass.  Any feedback is welcome, and opinions will surely be ignored.  (I was kidding on the last part of that sentence.) I hope you enjoy these principles, I created this list for each and every one of you.  I hope you find it humorous.    Keith.    Principles for Office Ease   1.   Never easily answer a question.  No matter how simple it is. Reason:  If someone asks you if you have completed a project, do not answer quickly 'yes' or 'no'.  Be sure to drag out answer using terms they dont understand or just look them in the eye perplexed as deer in the headlights.  If the question is simple, such as Are you wearing pants today? the same principles apply.  2.   Never openly volunteer for a project. Reason:  This will cause you more work than you ever envisioned.  It may involve several meetings (to be avoided at all costs) and due to the inability of being able to crawl into the assignees head, you will incorrectly interpret the project.  Failure is inevitable.  3.   Use the Freedom speech from Braveheart daily while standing on your desk.  Use voice mail if necessary, and applying blue face paint to one side of your face is an added bonus.   Reason:  It is a better speech than using the line of dialogue from The Patriot where Mel Gibson peers into the eyes of Col. Tannington and says, Before this war is over, Im going to kill you.  Albeit, you could substitute the word project for war, there are the possibilities of threats being interpreted with that movie quote.  Better off to use Braveheart.  4.   You must have a meeting for a meeting- it is a law. Reason:  To cause your sanity to falter and cause disruptions in your day.  It also makes you co-dependent on your Microsoft Office Calendar, because if it isnt there, then it doesnt exist.  This principle derived from the Central Intelligence Agency.    5.   Making travel arrangements for ones boss is strictly the wrath of God. Reason:  I once called the airlines six times in one day because my superior changed their mind that many times.  I felt that adding the airlines phone number to my phones speed dial would cause me to lose my edge.    6.   Charts are an excellent idea; they make it look like youre working. Reason:  Make the largest chart you can on an 11x17 sheet of paper in the landscape direction.  Be sure to hang this in your cubicle, and when you dont want to work on some mundane project, stare at the chart.  When asked, tell your co-workers youre concentrating on the strategic plan of the organization and the ramifications of implementing it into your department.  Those exact words are excellent bullshit, I might add.  7.   A piece of paper in your hand at all times is a good idea. Reason:  If you have a piece of paper in your hands while roaming the cubicle isles, it makes it appear as though you are working.  Of course, you very well could be.  Be sure that the piece of paper is an office document and not some medieval stick figure drawing that a trained chimpanzee could draw better.  8.   Walk quickly. Reason:  When roaming the cubicle isles it is also important to walk quickly.  This means that you are in a hurry, so annoying people in other departments would be unwise to slow you down or at all costs, stop you.   9.   Perceive to be irate at all times when utilizing principle #8. Reason:  People will not stop you from where you are headed -(if you are headed anywhere other than for a second cup of coffee or the restroom.)  10.   The copier loathes you. Reason:  No matter how sweetly you speak to it, the copier is your nemesis in the office.  It is out to destroy you and all your fellow feeble co-workers; however, it must need paper and toner to survive, so it does have weaknesses.  Utilize those.   11.   There are at least five people in your office at all times who are likely to come into work heavily armed with weapons.  Reason:  Do not make small talk with these people.  It is a better idea to simply pretend that you are listening to them.  Give them a time limit in your head.  When the limit is up, finish your departure with a thanks again or talk to you later.  12.   Keep a three-month calendar on your wall; write things on it that attribute to your department even though you have no intentions of reading it. Reason:  This makes it appear that you do care about what you have to do next week.  You dont, but appearances are everything.  Important note:  When asked what you have next week to do, do not reply, I really dont give a flyin fig what I have to do!    13.   The people in computer support will give you a bogus answer to any problem. Reason: They are probably smarter than you.  I am sorry to be the one to tell you.  Although, if they mention the words flux capacitor, youve got them, Ace.  14.   If the company fails, you fail.   Flip side to this statement: If you fail, the company reassigns you the same project and some extra work, just in case.  No further explanation is necessary.  15.   When bored during a company meeting, imagine members of your staff fighting as gladiators in the Coliseum until one is dead. Reason:  Not only will this pass the time, no one gets hurt.  The Romans had the right idea.  If you dont believe me, then youve never seen Gladiator.  16.   Part-time employees always feel that their project is equal to that of mapping the human genome.   Sometimes, an alignment by a full time staff member is necessary. Reason:  When part-staff members feel that their project deserves all prestige over  full-time staff projects, a full time staff member must inform them of the err of their ways.  Brute force and blunt objects are not necessary; however, may be required in some distinct cases, speaking from experience.  17.   Pretend that your cubicle has a door with a screech or squeak.   Reason:  Creativity to the highest degree is always needed.  Why just pretend you have a door?  How about doorbell?  Or a pretend dog that has their own swinging- door within the door?    18.   Wear headphones while you do your work.  Reenact scenes from Star Wars- such as the final Death Star battle.  Scream loudly when you going to crash.  Reason: Not only is this hilarious, but others in cubicleville can join in.  Isnt that why speakerphones were created?  19.   Start the day by addressing your computer as HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey.  If you can find the WAV of him addressing Dave, use it as your start-up sound.  Reason: You will determine which poor souls in your office have never experienced those fine movies- never speak to those people again. Ever.   20.   When someone asks you if you have a particular project done yet, say almost.  Then wait two hours, go to them, and ask what they want for that project.  Reason:  They will forget that they asked you two hours earlier, whereas you will probably get an extension on the project time-line.   21.   When someone sneezes, just dont bellow over your cubicle wall with the words Bless you, call them up and tell them.   Reason:  Bellowing over the cubicle wall is impolite.  The office isnt a farm. Sending an email is also appropriate and considerate.  22.	To avoid all face-to-face contact with your direct supervisor, email them at 4:59PM the outcomes of all the activities during the day they assigned you, quickly shut off the computer, and then walk to their office to tell them goodbye.  Chances are, they will be too inundated with reading that email, that they will mutter a goodbye.  Now get the hell out of there.  23.   Run the Matrix screen saver over your lunch hour. Reason: It will make co-workers walk past your cube and question where in the hell theyve seen scrolling lines of encoded text before, and will cause them to wonder about you.  A beautiful thing indeed, now you have the upper hand!  Mysteriousness is an adjective you should strive for yourself.     Thank you for reading.

       So, I went to the concert last night...which was really enjoyable. But, I have to say, the sheer number of people at Blossom last night really kinda detracted from some of the fun. However, Jimmy was in rare form, and we all had a terrific night. I left a few minutes early so I wouldn't get stuck in the horrible traffic log-jam that happens out there. Blossom is situated in the middle of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area, and is serviced by 2 and 3 lane roads in and out of the park...so no matter what, you're stuck for awhile! Tonight, I resume rehearsals for  Murder by the Falls , an annual interactive fundraiser for the theatre. Other than that, no too much going on. I am looking forward to my extra-long weekend with Tricia in Philly!

       Well, girls...I'm back from fishing. I have one word for you: YECCHHHH! Nine hours on a boat 12 miles out into Lake Erie is only considered a good time in my book if it includes hot, ripped naked dancing boys and a cooler full of alcoholic beverages. Instead, imagine being stranded on a boat with the cast of Grumpy Old Men. I was dying out there. And, to make it worse: I got tickets to the Madonna concert in Detroit! Late Saturday afternoon, my friend Michelle called and offered me two tix to that night's show! Ugh! I had to pass them up and I am a stupid-ass homo for doing so! Flog me later. Nothing but big beluga-whale sized relatives, burping, farting, phlegm-hawking and creepy-crawly live bait. Let me say this right here: I hate killing things. I always have. Once, when I was mowing the lawn, I accidentally ran over a big toad and decapitated it. I felt guilty for days...guilty enough to convert to Catholicism. So, imagine me piercing the bellies of those poor crayfish ( nee : crawdads, crawfish) and casting them into the depths of Lake Erie only to me gobbled up by Small-Mouth Bass or Sheepshead. I needed some sort of anti-nausea medication...if only I had brought along my big inflatable purse...it might have been able to paddle to shore...or at least tagged a chic tan on my way back to the beach. At any rate, me, the big fairy, caught NOTHING. Yes, this faggot can't fish. I can do plumbing, electrical...all sorts of highly-useful butch lesbianic activities, but I CANNOT FISH. I am working on a whole new thesis which I will present here at a later time. In any case, I'm glad to be back home...and yes, I made it in time for the Madonna concert live on HBO.

We're going to a resort area on western Lake Erie called (strangely) East Harbor to spend the night and then go fishing tomorrow morning. Okay, all of you can stop laughing. No, I don't know crap about fishing...but Uncle Bob gave this to me as one of my Xmas presents and, well, I couldn't exactly refuse, could I? I'm hoping it's lots of fun and will provide me with a little Blogger material. Please don't worry about me while I'm away, I've packed plenty of showtunes and a waterproof purse. Anyway...last night after my dinner with Phil and the gang, I picked up Kel and we went to the Market Ave. Wine Bar and then to Duck Island Club. At Duck Island, I ran into some old friends and Joe (the big scary ex from last year). Very eventful evening, very alcoholly...didn't feel so great this morning. All better now, though. See ya when I'm back from fishin' !!

       So, anyway...I have to figure out why all my pics weren't posting like I'd asked them to...until then, I'll remove my broken-down link. Today is all about catching-up on errands I couldn't do whilst starring in   urlLink Chicago   for the past 6 weeks...those of you who missed it, I hate you.  urlLink Click here  to  kiss my ass  and apologize and/or grovel for forgiveness. For those of you who actually got off your asses and saw the show (paid good cash-money to see it) and want to see me again...fear not, Fran Weissler has offered me the role of  Billy Flynn  on Broadway, alternating Wednesday matinees at the Shubert. I guess that's when Brent gets his back, bikini and monobrow waxed. Fran has agreed to pay me $400 per show, plus my airfare, so I figure I've got it pretty good for now. So now I get to run around doing ordinary things like dropping off the dry cleaning, mowing the lawn, doing grocery shopping and doing the bills. What a drag (and not in the fabulous, glamorous sense, either you freak)! Well, I hope the rest of you are well on your way to a wonderful weekend! I will be just as soon as I finish this pitcher of Margaritas. Besos...

       I just returned from the movies! The beautiful old Vaudeville-era theaters in which I work, host a wonderful  urlLink classic cinema series . Imagine a beautiful '20s movie palace...old organ playing before the feature...a newsreel and a few cartoons. Tonight's feature was   urlLink Rebel Without A Cause   starring the dreamy James Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo (as opposed to the other Rebel Without A Cause starring Hal Slabotnick and Joyce Lawnweasel, right?). Anyway, had a terrific evening, even though I'm barely awake. Managed to pick up my Jetta from the dealer...she was in for an oil change and a new brake light.

         Stuart Family Technology Update      In a stunning forward-thinking move, my mother,  urlLink Sue , actually succumbed to the  urlLink Telephone Company . She's ditched those unreliable old digital tapeless answering machines in favor of "no muss, no fuss" voicemail. Way to go, mom! Welcome to the 20th...er...21st century! Now, if I can get her to ditch that WebTV thingy...

       Went to see a movie with Thomas last night...great little French flick called  urlLink The Closet . Hysterical! I loved it! I wouldn't be surprised if some  film giant regurgitated this terrific film into some mediocre American version. If you get a chance to see it, do! I'm still giggling!!

       This just in from a very evil reader:     ..you're not, by any chance, confusing the Dan sighting with the pot-bellied pig sighting, are you?   Just curious.     no comment.

       After much discussion with my friend Trish in Philly, and a few too many stories about a pig named "Hank", we determined that what I saw from my bathroom window was most likely a full-grown   urlLink Potbellied pig ...very domesticated & quite dog-like in behavior.  Cool!  I want to go outside and pet it if I see it again. They don't bite, do they?

        Celebrity Sighting!    I thought you might appreciate this update. So, Miss Kelly and I went out for a nice leisurely lunch at the Diner on Clifton at around 1pm this afternoon. I had this weird gut-level feeling that I was going to run into Dan. I wasn't disappointed. A few minutes after ordering, the star of   urlLink unravel in 58  , entered the restaurant with a friend. I waved and said hello as he walked by our 2-top, only to return when  the only empty table is the one right next to Kel and me. I think it made him way more uncomfortable than it did me. Keep in mind, we haven't seen each other in 4 months...so this was our first encounter. He looks tan and healthy and no worse for the wear...I'm sure he's been out doing a lot of boating and skiing...but he also seems to have had a torrid love-affair with food since our break-up. Upon leaving the restaurant, I waved to say goodbye...he didn't look at me. I waved again...no dice. Just because I said I didn't want to talk to him doesn't mean we can't greet each other in public. Ah well...I did my part. In the end, a lot less stressful and uneasy than I imagined our first meeting would be.

        Goodnight CHICAGO...    glimpses from closing night     Claire, the lady in the box office I won't see for awhile. The houseboards, marquee and lobby displays disassembled. The final audience buzzing with excitement, wanting the elusive magic of the final performance. The dressing rooms, once homey and lived-in, now cluttered and torn apart as we prepare to take our things home. The sign-in sheet on the callboard now full. Clips, reviews, photos and various sign-up sheets tattered, worn at the edges. Props: umbrellas, newspapers, old-fashioned cameras holding on for one last performance. Spike tape and glow tape just as it was during tech...some of it replaced after heavy traffic. The orchestra warming-up. The techies prepping the sets, lights and special effects. Listening to the Overture one last time. Seeing each cast member take the stage for their final show. Standing alone behind the center upstage door awaiting my entrance  Is everybody here!? Is everybody ready!? . Seeing Roxy's bowler hat lower from the flies during "Roxy." Watching everyone watching everyone else...taking inventory of the faces and the experience so we won't forget any of it. Being surprised at just how emotional our final show is for me. Standing with Pam (Roxy) on the empty courtroom set and saying "Well, I guess that's it for you and me..." and really feeling my own subtext. Singing my final note, slamming the center upstage door...and losing my shit. Standing with the company stage left hugging and kissing each other during "Nowadays." Taking my final bow. Restoring my costumes and props to their cases and boxes. Cleaning my area of the dressing room. Watching the set disassembled and removed. Saying goodbye to everyone one last time. Being told goodbye one last time. Walking out past the marquee...already advertising the next show. Without a trace...CHICAGO was gone. As I walked away from the theater, and into the center of town, I realized I'll miss Billy Flynn most of all. So, if you see him...give him my regards. I'll miss ya, pal.    It's just a noisy hall where there's a nightly brawl      and all that jazz ...

       I forgot to tell you...this morning as I was getting ready to take a shower, I look out the window from the master bath, and I see this large brownish-gray pig wandering through my neighbor's yard. It looks like it was domesticated...happily snuffling through the grass...pigtail wagging cheerfully. I had never seen it before, and stood there in disbelief. Who keeps a pig in the city?  And no one keeps a cow for a friend...sometimes I fear you're touched...

       I spent most of yesterday just as squirrelly as ever...not sure why. I am so happy to finally be at home and sleeping in my own bed! Last night's performance was great...we even had a last minute replacement for Go To Hell Kitty, who was in the hospital recovering from a nasty asthma attack. So, the swing went on...and did a great job! Ricki (some men just can't hold their arsenic) brought her boyfriend  urlLink Connor  to the cast party. He's an absolute doll And a rising popstar in Europe. Such a sweet guy & very talented...or so Ricki tells me. Today will be all about catching up on laundry and relaxing here at 5216 Bridge.

       Okay so I have decided to give the Sade tickets to Kelly who will invite Tom, Ed and Greg from across the street, unless Steve comes up from Columbus. I'm sure I'll get to see the show once they release it on DVD. In other concert news, I also just snagged two VIP Box Seats and backstage parking for John Mellencamp & The Wallflowers show on August 30. It's going to be a wedding gift to Laurie and Scott who were married at the end of July. What else? It seems that new musical I workshopped two years ago still has life in her...The Sissy Show will head out on the road again, this time to Yale, in conjunction with a conference on gender and sexuality in October. So, Todd's touring again. I'll post as details become available. I finished lyrics to a new song yesterday and shipped them off to Doug for his two cents, and I can't wait to get back into the studio to work on it.

       Tonight's my last night out here at  Rusty Ranch . This weekend is my last for  Chicago . Lotsa stuff finishing, ending. I guess it makes way for the new...and, Oh, I am ready! I spent the better part of the evening catching-up with an old friend. We have a tradition of celebrating our birthdays and Christmas in the summer...so tonight was the night! I got this great book of black & white photos called  Backstage . It features really great candid backstage photos from a handful of Broadway shows. I also received a serenity fountain for my house...very cool...I'll just have to figure out where to put it. Kevin called me and told me I had 4 loge tix to the Sade concert Saturday, too bad I'll be doing my own show. Sigh. She's my absolute favorite!!

        Exciting Discoveries at Work    Wherein Todd finds love and cake.    Okay, maybe not love, but today is   Cake Day   here at our venerable old institution. Once monthly, we congregate in an old abandoned cabaret venue to celebrate birthdays and consume vast quantities of baked confections, salty treats and sugary soda-pop. I like the marble-swirled cake...mixing up the chocolate and white cake, like soft-serve swirl ice cream cones. But, my favorite of your basic cakes is yellowcake with chocolate frosting. I'm presently writing you from deep inside a sugar coma. I'll be back later, following my withdrawal and sugarshock. Ciao!

        Don't read this post (I'm so not kidding...it's long and punishing)    If I could manage a string of thoughts, I'd put them together and write them down here. I feel so distracted and non-committal about everything right now. And yes, I've been thru these phases before and I'll be out of it in a day or two...I just hate being in it, y'know? Being out in the country compounds it all, too. I have way too much time to myself, way too much time to think, ponder, consider and ruminate. In the end, I'm probably thinking  too  much.   One of my grandmothers said that we spend too much time in our heads, and what really counts in this life are our relationships with others...and those relationships are dictated by the heart, not by the brain. Don't you find yourself walled-up in your head sometimes? Likewise, how often have you been completely ruled by your heart? Me...more times than I care to admit. So, is it possible to strike a balance? My grandmother would say no. She would say that the heart must rule all in the realm of human relationships.   Maybe we're just scared. Maybe we're too scared too much of the time to really give ourselves the opportunity to be truly happy. I wonder if I fell in love with someone somewhere else, would I go to him? Would my head get in the way and stop me? What purpose is logic in the realm of love? Does it have a place? I would wish that I could abandon everything and go to him...leaving my doubts and fears behind. I realize that I am not strong enough to overcome my own self...and isn't that stupid?   If you could be ruled by love, would you?   That's why I like that line  "I'm holding my heart out, but clutching it, too..."  In the end, is it better to just say what you feel at all times, no matter what cost in potential discomfort, embarrassment or whatever fear to which you've become enslaved? Sometimes I think this is the way. Say what you feel, at all times and at all costs...speak your truth, speak your heart. No matter what the outcome, you will always gain. And, even though I understand that, and even though it makes complete sense to me, I'm still afraid, I'm still quiet. I'm still fucking silent.    I told you not to read this post...   sucker...

       I'm back out in the country since yesterday. So far, there's been lots of early rising, excessive driving and one very road-weary Todd...and, as you may have noted, very little blogging going on. So sorry 'bout that. Not that it's all bad out here...it really is gorgeous. The nights get so dark, and the tree frogs and crickets are obnoxiously loud. Last night, Rusty kept growling and barking at something outside. After a few minutes of him making lots of noise, I decided to check it out. Canine prowler...some ragamuffin shep-lab mix running around the house and sticking his face in the windows...scared the S#%t outta me for a second. No wonder Rusty was going beserk! So, after this 3:45am sleep-depriving activity, I finally fell fast and far into a very deep sleep...only to be shattered awake at 6:45am by the alarm clock. See, at  my  house, I'd get up at 8:15, so anything earlier just about kills me. Just think, I get to do it three more times this week! Joy joy joy...

One more show to go this weekend...I'll leave in 15 minutes, back to the land of Chi. I'm looking forward to a little slow-down...coming at me at 9:30 tonight, when I walk out of the stage door and blissfully toward home, rest and myself. O lovely quiet!

         urlLink Reasons Why       Where am I today? I wish that I knew  'Cause looking around there's no sign of you  I don't remember one jump or one leap  Just quiet steps away from your lead    I'm holding my heart out but clutching it, too  Feeling this sort of a love that we once knew  I'm calling this home when it's not even close  Playing the role with nerves left exposed   And standing on a darkened stage  Stumbling through the lines  Others have excuses  But I have my reasons why...   We get distracted by dreams of our own  But nobody's happy while feeling alone  And knowing how hard it hurts when we fall  We lean another ladder against the wrong wall   And climb high to the highest rung  To shake fists at the sky  While others have their excuses  I have my reasons why   With so much deception it's hard not to wander away  It's hard not to wander away, it's hard not to wander away...

I won BIG! I've made some great new friends, and even reunited with a long lost college friend...and managed to drag all y'all readers thru the LaBrea Tarpits of my lovelife...not bad for a year's work, huh? all I know is this:    I'm glad you were along for the ride.

        Welcome to the Parkview Nite Club   If you head west on Detroit Avenue on Ohio City, just west of Downtown Cleveland, you'll feel the heat from W.58th Street long before you get there. Those blues manage to find their way all the way up the block from the club. If you were driving on Detroit, you'd take a right on 58th toward Erie, toward the bluff that looks over the shoreway and the city, and the Great Lake beyond. You'd pass the Zone Car, a popular watering hole with cops. Just north of the Zone Car, and sitting on the corner, is the Parkview. It's one of those old, bluecollar joints that's been around forever...well, at least since the 50's. Inside, imagine the most eclectic group of people...shiftworkers, musicians, business types and dockworkers. You'd notice the array of neon signs, sports parephenalia, odd bits of taxidermy and black and white pics of B-movie stars. Last night, Kelly meandered toward the back of the bar to grab seats close to the makeshift stage...which is located in front of the  Roller-Bowler  machine and to the side of the pool table. Augie and his band  Walkin' Cane  were headlining last night. They're amazingly talented...he even gave us both their brand-new CD  Radio Cafe . Bonus! We both tossed back an ice-cold Rolling Rock (or two) and settled for an evening of Blues Jam. We saw a total of 4 different bands over the course of the night...most notably one that featured an 8-year old bass guitarist...who was incredible! By 12:30, we headed back out into the sweltering heat and humidity...looking forward to our air conditioned bedrooms...

       I had an incredibly interesting update from Lee yesterday. He filled me in on the past 9 months of his life. I can't begin to explain the absolute roller-coaster he's been on both professionally and personally, but he's fine now. Some of the bullet points include being the target of blatant anti-gay discrimination, terrifying experiences with domestic violence and fucked-up interactions with the local authorities.  Messed up shit!  In any case, he's doing much better...the anti-gay issue has been resolved, the domestic violence perp. is no longer living in this country and hopefully, the legal issues will soon be completely resolved. My heart goes out to him. He's quite a survivor...things ain't never been easy for Lee, but he always manages to find success. I'm pleased he's back on his feet. As always, it's great just to catch up. Tonight, I am having dinner with my friend Margaret, and then Kelly and I will be going to Blues Jam over at the Parkview.

       So many hopes and dreams are pinned on love. We seem to evaluate our personal success by way of relationships, significant others and sexual prowess. There is so much pressure on people in our culture to couple. The theorem that love = happiness seems true, but is it, really? We all seem to ready to accept that completely. Does love equal happiness? Must we have a significant other in order to reach penultimate happiness? Our culture seems to indicate " yes ." From our earliest moments, we are bombarded with images of coupling and/or marriage. Women in our society are in a social pressure-cooker where they are repeatedly told to look forward to the most important day of their lives. Is it any wonder why single women over 30, in particular, seem obsessed, no...crazed about finding their life-partner? Of course they're crazed about it...they've been conditioned since birth. This is not to say that men don't feel the pressure, too, but how often do you hear a father tell his son, "Your wedding day will be the most important day of your life...it'll be so exciting going to the tux shop to pick out cummerbunds together." I'll answer that: like,   never  ! So, with all that pressure, no wonder people make snap decisions and bad coupling occurs. Fear that one will never reach penultimate happiness grows until freakazoid stalker at the gym suddenly looks like Mr. Right. Don't fall for it, ladies...it's called Marriage Mirage...all those good qualities you thought you saw evaporate when you wake up from your chiffon and lace-induced fantasy. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm all for monogamy, long-term relationships and even marriage. I'm just not for obsessive-compulsive marriage behavior. Look, I'll cut you some slack because I'm sure no one ever told you this, but,  you can actually be happy without a diamond ring . You are actually worth a whole helluva lot on your own. You are a worthy person without that compromise you call "fiancee." Do me a favor...make sure you really are self-actualized and happy before you invite me to sidle-up to the stringbeans and mashed potatoes at your reception.

        my big gay life (50)    Threesome   Everything happens in three's, right? It must have been the full moon on Aug. 4th. It  musta . I knew something weird was going down in my universe. First, I get a voicemail from my long-lost first love, Lee. He's now living with his partner in Miami, Florida. I haven't spoken to him since November, I think, which is merely a lapse in emailing/calling. So, I was very happy to get back in touch. Then, I turn on the television last night and see that a certain minor musical celebrity is back in town hawking his new CD on the old PBS channel...could that explain the flurry of "Private" calls on my caller ID.  Weird . Then, when I return from my show last night, Neighbor Thomas is sitting on my side porch with Miss Kelly. Apparently, he just showed-up last night for Sex And The City & QAF...which is great that he feels so comfortable coming on over. We watched the QAF repeat & then he went home to crash. As I thought about the whole day, I couldn't help but chuckle. I mean, no big deal, right?! But still, 3 in one day makes for an eyebrow-raising moment. And, I had this dream this morning right before I woke up. In it, I was driving my car and I got into an accident...and I could see the whole thing happening and it wasn't scary and I knew I'd be okay. So, the accident happened, and I got out of the car unscathed. Dream analysis says that auto accidents mean the return of something lost or out of touch. Huh!?  Interesting...

       Gorgeous! Today is a dream come true! It's, like, 78 degrees, sunny and  not  humid for once! I'm sorta schlumping around before I hafta hit the road again to go to the theatre...it all sounds so glamourous, doesn't it? Caffeine seems to have dissipated my earlier headache. To my chagrin, no hunky farm boys showed-up at Phil's Ranch out in Russell Twp. over the weekend. Not even handsome landscapers were to be seen. What good is going to the country when you're single if you can't even find some decent rural eye-candy? Tell me  that !

Going home to check on Toby and Kelly, then I have another show tonight at 7...so no fine Sunday evening cable programming for me...no  urlLink QAF  and no  urlLink SATC . What to do?

       Did I mention that I smashed my finger in the car door last night? (Yo soy dumbass) Now, my right thumb has an ugly reddish-blue stripe running the vertical length of my thumbnail. Ack! Now I'm  flawed . Will anyone recognize me with this hideous claw? Will people recoil? I guess I'll slap a Band-Aid on it and go do the show. In other news, the pollen index is way off the charts here in Russell Township. If I didn't have allergies before (and I didn't) I certainly do now. No hunky country boys to speak of yet...well...that's not true. I guess  I'm  here. I miss being at my house in the city...my cute little Victorian neighborhood and all of my big gay neighbors. I miss Toby, too. He can't stay here with me and Rusty because Rusty would devour him as a snack, so, Tobester gets to lounge in the city with housemate Kelly.

       Again, last night, we're apparently the funniest goddamned show on the planet. For the second Friday in a row, we had the most hysterical audience...they laughed...no guffawed at  every thing. Sometimes I just don't get it. I had a weird show...the audience loved it, but I felt like I was just a step behind everyone. I hate when that happens...kinda feels like medicine-head...all floaty-like. I guess I should stop taking K before the show.

       So, I arrive at work this morning  early . This is merely to do with the fact that I was house/dog sitting waaaay out in Russell Township and had no idea just how long morning rush would take. As luck would have it, I even beat my boss to the office. However, on my jaunt over to Starbucks, I noted a gray smoke billowing from the Keith Building just down the block...the building which houses our Palace Theatre. That can't be good, I thought to myself as I ordered my Venti Traditional with room for cream. As it turns out, some electrical transformer caught fire in the basement, the building was evacked...but no one was injured, thankfully. The only property seriously damaged by the fire was a restaurant on the main floor called Acapella...which sustained major smoke damage. I hope Karen, the owner, gets a huge settlement check and that she reopens...I love that restaurant. Anyhow, the Keith Bldg. is also one of Cleveland's telecommunications/tech. hubs...so, our internet and telephone systems were down for the morning. This is not conducive to efficient business. At any rate, I am home now doing a load of laundry before I head out to the theatre this evening. Don't forget I'm out in the country. Send me emails!!!

        urlLink  Wow...feeling way left-out of all the good times being had in NYC this week. I may need to call in the understudy and jet off to the Big City for the BlogMeet, or is it some sort of festival? A fair? Sex-a-thon? Looks like  urlLink RJ  and  urlLink Bill  and  urlLink Jonno  will all be there. I feel so outta the loop. So, I am now hereby declaring the first ever (that I know of) Midwest festival of the Blogs:  blog OHIO  ...open to all blogging folks in the greater Midwest area. I'll invite  urlLink Andrew  and  urlLink Cinnamon  and  urlLink Brandon  and that Katie-chica from  urlLink JeJune  (that's a good start). Where else can we drum-up some other regional bloggers?

       Well, I'm coming up on my one year anniversary of Blogging (Aug. 10). The first time I heard about it was in some random email from the kind folks at  urlLink EarthSkank ...talkin' 'bout some online journaling. So, I checked it out...and being an avid analog journaler, I thought this might be fun to try...plus it helped with my writing teacher's instructions to write something... anything ...every day. So, here I am a whole year later with tons of random written detritus, feeling wildly validated and overexposed. I think I deserve a month in Capri.

       I used to be a Scout. My father was a Scout and a Scoutmaster. Scouting's been a big part of our family's history. But, even my coming-out at age 17 didn't immediately change my father's opinion of gays in the Boy Scouts. Just recently, he seems to have come around...realizing the idiocy of exclusion based on fear. I ask you, who are the big sissies, now?!    urlLink Scouts Divided    Since a Supreme Court ruling against gays in the Boy Scouts, Americans are increasingly torn over a beloved institution.

        pop news   (from PEOPLE)  Backstreet's A.J. Expands Rehab Time   Backstreet Boys have put the brakes on their current North  America tour for a second time as group member A.J. McLean,  23, extends his time in rehabilitation for another two  weeks, the band announced Tuesday. McLean is in a 30-day  treatment program at an undisclosed rehab facility that  handles alcoholism, depression and other problems, his  bandmates first announced on MTV on July 9. The Boys had  been set to reconvene on the road next Tuesday but will now  resume on Aug. 24 in Milwaukee, according to a new  announcement from the band. "A.J.'s initial treatment is  going very well," Backstreeter Kevin Richardson said in a  statement. "His doctors have suggested it would be in A.J.'s  best interest to take an additional two weeks in transitional  care." The Backstreet Boys's tour is part of the promotion  for their new album, "Black & Blue," which has sold 5.2  million copies in the U.S. in the 35 weeks since its  release. That sales figure is far short of their previous  CD, "Millennium," which had sold 9.6 million copies in the  same amount of time, reports Reuters.

       I'm thinking that I need a caffeine infusion to continue the day (it's now only 9:40am). I had a fun night (impromptu porch party), drinking and carousing. Plus, we have this cool event today at Noon. In honor of our classic film series starting tonight, we're shutting down the street and having a chariot race a la Ben Hur. Should be a hoot! I hope I get to wear a toga.

       I managed to recover from the early morning yesterday...when I finally woke up this morning...I did miss Keith's going away party, I hope he'll forgive me. Today, I lounged around in my pajamas until around 11:30. I decided I'd better get outside while it was dry and sunny and mow the lawn (maybe one last time). Seeing as the weather was so fantastic, I took my bike and went for another 25-miler on the Towpath Trail in the heart of the  urlLink Cuyahoga Valley National Park . It didn't seem as long this week. The bonus this time was seeing a coyote. I startled it in a remote section of the trail. He was drinking from the river when I rode by. He skittered across the water and up the other embankment. He was a mottled red and gray...looking exactly like a picture at the ranger station I visited at the end of my ride. This evening, I went to the Weber Family annual Clam Bake...and there's nothing better on a crisp Autumn night!! Tomorrow is  urlLink Palooza , so I get to go into work...joy.

        all's well in Ward 17   I went to a candidates' night event at St. Colman's Church in my neighborhood last evening. There's an exciting political race brewing here in my Ward...a longtime incumbent decided to give up his seat, and now we've got four candidates duking it out for the job. One of the candidates is Buck Harris, my next door neighbor, and the former host of the radio show I produced and co-hosted for 5 years. I have to admit that I was very skeptical when he announced his candidacy, but after listening to him in a totally different context last night, I have to say I'm extremely impressed! Also impressive was Julie Candela who is running a phenomenally relevant campaign with less than 6,000 bucks. I was disappointed by Matt Zone, who, at 38, has managed to amass the support of the political machine here in Cleveland. There's nothing wrong with him, per se, but there's something off about him. Too slick maybe. So, our primary is Tuesday, Oct. 2. We'll whittle it down to two...and then it's going to get good! Outside of passing out a few flyers, I've never really participated in any of this campaign stuff. It was great to see a packed meeting hall...people out really concerned with the political process in their own backyards. So, did I change my mind about the candidates last night? Yep. Now at least I know who I'm not voting for...

It's a Blue Heron .     So .     So, it's magnificent. It's not like you see them all the time.      I do. Every time I visit my parents. There's this, what do you call it?      Call what?      The thing where they nest...it has some name.      Rookery?      Rookery. Right. And there are tons of Herons there...sleeping .     Nesting.      Sleeping.      Nesting . Tons?      Yep. Blue ones .     Really.      Big Blue Herons everywhere, all over the treetops.     Do they just, what? Sit there?      Do birds "sit" ??     You know...in the nest?     Well, and they swoop.     Swoop?     Swoop down from the nest. To get food.     But they eat fish.     Right. They swoop to fish.     Okay. We are not having this conversation.     Sure. Whatever.

       I walked around the city streets tonight. The pavement wet with the first icy rain of Autumn. Lights reflected and streched disproportionately across the asphalt. The taxi and the bus splashed puddles onto the sidewalk and my khaki pants, belching black diesel exhaust...adding insult to injury. There were no people out, no one walking dogs or visiting on porch stoops. No gossiping and no fighting. No neighbors sitting outside strumming guitars and singing songs of San Juan. No crack-copters overhead. Just me and the slick pavement. Me and my wet shoes and cold feet. My cold feet.

       I haven't felt this anxious since the spring of 1998, when my world caved inward under the enormous corporate pressure of four 800-pound gorillas:  urlLink Chicago ,  urlLink Rent ,  urlLink Disney's Beauty and the Beast  and  urlLink Riverdance . Like then, I have that sinking, sick feeling in my stomach, things change from day to day and I am uncertain. I flinch every time the phone rings. Thankfully, I had only one day of this. Yesterday, I had a nice family (30 or so people) dinner celebrating my sister and aunt's birthdays. As I was driving home, I received two squirrelly messages on my voicemail at home. One, a friend asking me to dinner one night this week. His tone and his voice registered alarm...although the casual listener would hear very little...I know my friend well. What I couldn't decide was if this was going to be about me and our friendship, or if it was something else entirely. I will find out Tuesday, when we have dinner together at his house. I just can't help but notice when something seems awry. Then, I received a message from another friend, with yet more unresolved issues. And, as much as I understand that we live in the gray...not much is black and white...I was just needing things to feel a little more...well...Zebra. Those two calls piled up with the fact that the producers of the current national tour I'm working on are getting mighty worried about the financials here in Cleveland. It seems that my advertising plan needs to be scoured, scrutinized and re-analyzed...this is enough to make anyone in the ad biz squirrelly, and I am squirrellier than a 3M Post-Its commercial. Anyhow, I know how to deal with this anxiety...god knows I've done it before. I spoke to the producers and we're working things out. I spoke to my friend & we're having dinner. I left a message for my other friend, so we'll see what happens. I've done all I could do for today. Why is finding a little inner peace and quiet so tough sometimes?

       I find myself spending any possible moment outdoors. Anything I can do outside...I'm doing it. I realized my intense need to be away from television, computer and radio. I spent all of yesterday out on the Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath...one of my favorite things to do in the CVNRA. I biked 25 miles in the brilliant sunshine along the canal and Cuyahoga River...all the way to Peninsula (where I stopped and had a Corona before starting the whole trip back to Cleveland. To me, there was nothing better than being out there, alone. I had a great afternoon being by myself, but I also had the opportunity to meet lots of people along the way. After a quick nap when I returned home, I went to a party at the home of a friend/coworker. At about 12:30 I was really feeling exhausted, so I headed off home & to sleep. After church this morning, I wandered over to the Tremont Arts Festival in Lincoln Park. After grabbing a coffee at Civilization, I walked along the tree-lined paths looking at all of the different booths and chatting with artists. I thought maybe  urlLink Jockohomo  might be there, but alas, I did not find the elusive fellow. Kelly and I spent some time sitting out on our front porch in the sunshine, and managed to see Dan ride his bike past the house. Always good to see old friends. Tonight, I am going to a big family "Hoo-Ha" for my Aunt Sally's birthday (it's also my sister's birthday). Actually, I am looking forward to starting another week at work. Maybe the routine is what I'm craving right now. Since I'm not rehearsing for the first time in over a year, it's taking me awhile to adjust.

       Went out last night after work with a few friends from work. Suffice it to say, there was much beer and revelry. We headed over to the Hanna Theatre as TnT was letting out, picked-up our friend Bradley and headed over to Becky's for another drink. Then, we decided to tag along and hang out with the TnT cast on their weekly bowling night at Cloverleaf Lanes. Thinking we should mount a Playhouse Square team and challenge them to a bowl-off.

        drive   Yesterday, there was church. And after, a leisurely coffee outside   urlLink Civilization   facing Lincoln Park. With my friends Brooke, Kelly,  urlLink Steve  and Lee, we discussed the week, the other incidental facts swept under the carpet...unimportant details which paled. We laughed, I made sure of that. At every moment possible, we laughed and we released. Lincoln Park has never looked to beautiful, so inviting, sun-dappled and velvet green. On any other day, an ordinary urban park, any other week...just a gathering place for the random human rubble: drug addicts and homeless. But, everyone here was, in fact, alive. Breathing. Warm. Away from the horror, choking dust and devastation. Here, we have only the tragedies of our own daily lives, each and every one of us. We lick our wounds, hoping the pain subsides. We try for the mute button. We search for beautiful pictures. We find neither. In searching, we are alive.    Last evening, after a large family gathering...with plentiful food, gifts and fellowship, I found myself driving home in the most beatiful twilight, the sky delicate pinks giving way to dense purple-blues. I left the highway in favor of the rural route through Peninsula, and the Cuyahoga Valley. Facing directly west, I could watch the sky kaleidoscope, and darken slowly. Quietly. For just twenty minutes, I drove through the forests conifer and deciduous, the road a winding ribbon of asphalt through the trees and earth. Alone, under the lush green canopy, I was alive. I was safe. I was finally able to let it go...a little. I rolled the windows down to feel the air, to taste it. To breathe.    And when it was completely dark, I went home...to the quiet routine of Sunday evenings. As I curled up on the couch, I wished I could share this blissful peace with everyone who would not know this kind of serenity for a very long time. I was thankful. I was humbled.     Namaste ... I bow to the Divine in you...

        Tongue planted firmly in cheek.   Do you know that that we gay folk are not allowed to donate blood? Well, that's if you answer the questions truthfully. Do you  know that we are not welcome to openly serve in the U.S. armed forces? I ask you,  what are the homosexuals supposed to do in this crisis? Our assistance is  not welcomed in those two sectors, so I say we support in the way we know  best: consumption. We gays can help stabilize the economy. We have the opportunity, nay,  duty  to assist our country in any and every way possible. Even if it means shopping in a mall with an Orange Julius. So, I have urged  every queen I know armed with a couple of credit cards to get out and hit  the malls, restaurants and upscale boutiques. We may not be able to assist  with the victims of the Pentagon crash and WTC collapse, but we can perform  triage on the nation's economy. We, the poofters, can singularly bolster the  US's soft economy. Who else knows how to shop and consume like we do? I say: No  One! Do your civic duty! I send you out in search of commercial fabulousity.  So, I say: "Go forth, girls, and CHARGE! On Visa, on MasterCard and Diner's Club...on Amex, platinum, gold and Blue!" Strengthen the USA at her core! Do it for Uncle Sam...and while you're at it...somebody get him a new outfit...

The hospital he works at is about 25 minutes outside of Manhattan.  They are (somehow) transporting people to every hospital possible...thousands are hurt or dead.

       So, I was all like  whatever  when I ran into my ex a few weeks ago. I know, I know...you're asking yourself, "Todd, just which ex are we talking about here?" However, what was unbeknownst to me was that he was a psycho-stalker who would stop at nothing to get in touch with me. Well, okay, maybe not that bad...but he started calling me everywhere I have a phone. At home. At work. On the cell. It was relentless. He'd do a phone carousel....call my house, my office and my cell phone within a 2 minute period, leaving messages at each location.  Freak .  So, I decided to ignore it for awhile, thinking he'd let up.  Nope.  So, in my best passive-aggressive behavior, I sent him an email stating that I'd been staying at my boyfriend's house since I got back from Philly. Well...that was the trick! Just as I had suspected, he emailed that he guess he had "more than just a clinical interest" in me. He wished me and my boyfriend luck, hoping my boyfriend wouldn't "fuck-up" like he did. Well, me too. I hope he doesn't fuck-up like you, too. But then I remembered that I don't actually have a boyfriend.  Damn .  Well, when I meet him, I'll have to thank him for his gracious hospitality this past week.    Speaking of ex's, I got a brief glimpse of another one this morning while I was at the market buying groceries. We don't speak anymore because in the fragile transition phase from boyfriends to friends who are boys, he seemed to displays lots of ridiculous pathological lying skills. It was never about anything important. It never even stood to gain him anything. And, as I always say, only employ deceit and trickery if it will result in free goods and services. Anyhow, I guess he's happily married to some guy named Michael. According to unnamed sources (Steve), he and Michael are still going strong and sharing a "faaaaaaabbbbbulous" loft apartment on Lorain Avenue. HA! Impossible! Lorain Avenue+fabulous is utterly inconceivable. Anyhow, I was busy grocery shopping....reprovisioning the house for Autumn (I only get groceries, like, once every 3 months) and wondering why I keep dating people who live in my neighborhood.  Note to self: quit that.

       Fridays are good. My Friday has been all about catching-up on stuff, settling scores, etc. I am happy to report that the ex-love-of-my-life-now-best-friend Lee, is free and clear of his recent legal nightmare. A victim of domestic violence, he called the Police for assistance only to be thrown in the slammer with charges pressed against him. Eventually, all was set straight...except for Lee who is still perfectly gay. Tonight, I am performing in a 2-nighter fundraiser for the CVLT, where I recently completed my run in  Chicago . Hope you all have terrific weekends!

         my beautiful respite    My lil vay-cay to Philly and the greater eastern seaboard was everything I needed it to be: relaxing, fun and slow! Things started off a bit dubiously... urlLink Continental Airlines  posted a delay in my outbound flight last Thursday. When I arrived at the airport that afternoon, we were treated to a nice little delay before the jet even managed to land. Then, we were herded onto the plane...a sold-out MD-80. All 141 of us taxied down to the end of the runway when we were told by the tower we needed to wait another 40 minutes.  Great . After about a 20 minute wait, we took-off and were hurtling toward Baltimore. Why Baltimore, you ask? Because, the round-trip fare to Philadelphia (my final destination) was a hefty $1,100!! YAH! So, I booked the much cheaper $104 ticket into BWI...planning to catch Amtrak up to Philly. Well...about 40 miles out of BWI, we're notified that there's some "weather in Baltimore and that we're 15th in line to land...and, oh yeah, we're running out of fuel.  Homo say what?  Yes, we are being diverted because we ain't go no gas to keep the big silver bird in the sky. Minutes go by. We're told we're diverting to Philly. Ha! Cruel gods! So, an hour later (guess we weren't THAT outta fuel) we land at PHL. The good Capitan tells us we can get off the plane, but if we have checked any bags...we're responsible to get them from BWI. Being the fabulously smart traveler that I am, I only have one teeny-tiny carry-on for the trip (Speedos don't take up much space, after all). I deplane at PHL...no Amtrak...no $1,100 fare. Ha! The airline screwed  themselves  outta my $1,000 clams extra just to land at PHL! My kinda good luck should be illegal! So, Trish and I commenced our weekend of relaxation and fun immediately at 7:30 EDT on Thursday night. Friday, I went to meet Trish at the office, after being served lunch by someone who could pass as Hottie Jon's little brother. Anyway, I go to  urlLink Trish's office  and say hello to my friends there. We take off from there and drive down the shore to Ocean City, New Jersey...where her sister and brother-in-law live. We have a boisterous and rousing round of miniature golf (I placed 2nd behind Trish's mom). Trish came in last...because she's a South Philly trash-tawking mini-golf whore. There, I said it. Saturday, Sunday and Monday were spent doing a whole hellava lot of nothing...which was wonderful! I did a ton of cooking with Trish and Marttie and learned lots of new recipes. I made some kick-ass southern pan-fried chicken, and Trish and I learned/mastered Marttie's secret spaghetti sauce. We did go see The Deep End...a total piece of crap movie. Plot holes the size of the LaBrea Tarpits. That hot Goran Visjnic guy from E.R. was in it though...Today, Trish and Marttie were headed on their way to Williamsburg, Virginia. They dropped me off at BWI at 9:30 this morning. I caught my flight right on time, and we actually landed a few minutes early. Dr. Tom picked me up from el aeropuerto. I collapsed at home for a delightful nap, and then went to 'hearsal. Tomorrow's the first day back in the office, so I expect it'll be busy. I hope you've been well. I've missed you all!

        Hey old friend...   Sometimes you definitely have to look back in order to go forward. Today was about revisiting times and places from my own not-so-distant past. This entailed a trip out to the country...out to where I'm from...that place called "home." Home in the sense of community, not necessarily the house, but I visited that, too. 8462 Rockspring was my address for 22 years, and today the house looks more or less the same, but had two adorable dogs sitting out front. One, under the dogwood tree was a Black Lab...the other, much older, sat up near the front steps and looked like a Golden/Collie mix. Winding my way through the streets of Lake Lucerne, it was hard not to become flooded with ancient memories of 4th of July parades, annual "Clean-Up" days and luminarios lining the entire community on Christmas Eve. I never thought I'd miss it much, but I never realized how special it was until I'd been away for a few years. Today, it was good to come home.   I visited a very close friend today, also. We had breakfast together and spent some much needed quality time catching-up. It's funny how people can be in your day-to-day life but you're somehow slipping away from each other. We both realized too much time had passed since we connected and shared. While our lives are different and separate, we make it a point to talk, to intersect, to be with each other. Indeed, it was good to come home.   It's funny how being in another city or state can help put perspective on your own life. Somehow, jumping out of your own routine for even a few hours, can totally alter your psyche, your mood and your heart. Nashville allowed me to rejuvinate mentally and physically. It allowed me to reconnect with a few people I love and respect in the business. It allowed me to take a look at where I am now, and to clarify the road ahead..a little. Look, things aren't always great. I'm not always happy...I get downright depressed sometimes...I behave poorly...act inconsiderately...say mean things...exhibit destructive behaviors. Sometimes, looking back at where you're from helps adjust things a few degrees...just enough. As I walked the nine blocks from the transit station to my house, it began to snow and the chill wind sliced right through me. It lashed at any exposed skin. I had not taken a coat with me to Nashville. I keyed into my house and a wave of warmth enveloped me. Toby, my dog, leaped and bounced and barked at the sight of me...ecstatic to have me back where I belonged...   It was good to be home.

        my big gay life (54)   Phil, one of my very best friends, and I auditioned for  The Wizard of Oz  last night. How gay is  that ?!?!! Pretty damn gay. Phil and I did the show two years ago, playing the Lion and Tin Man, respectively. We were once again auditioning for the same roles, and hoping to be cast in the show with our friend Ricki Gerald (Dorothy)...who is uber-talented and breaktakingly gorgeous! So, both Phil and I are on standby mode as we wait for the final casting information. I will say that I make a damn good Tin Man...even though  urlLink Jeff  is even better!   In other big gay news,  urlLink Charlie  is now enjoyng the fine Southern life in  urlLink New Orleans . He and Dex are adjusting well and I'm really happy that he seems so happy and grounded. If you haven't checked out his latest entries, do! I'm getting ready for a business trip to Nashville tomorrow.

        People I've Lost Track Of   RYAN LYDEN    Ryan Lyden and I became fast friends when I was in the first grade at Gardiner Elementary School in Bainbridge Township, Ohio. I had the great fortune to have the teacher, Mrs. Larkins, who was located directly across the hall from my mother's room. So, I attended class in Room 14, while Mom taught in Room 15. Even though she says she had nothing to do with it, I doubt it was accidental. The two rooms often teamed-up for activities, field trips and movies...you remember those...where everyone sits cross-legged on the carpeted section of the classroom? Well, Ryan was a student in my Mom's class, and throughout the year, he and I became close friends.    By the time we got to second grade, we were nearly inseparable. Between Grades 2 and 5 we spent nearly every day together in class, and most weekends sleeping over at each other's homes. Sometimes, we'd stay with our other close friend, Paul, on his dairy farm. Halfway through the first quarter of sixth grade, he announced that his stepfather had been relocated to Kansas. Overland Park, I think. So, he moved away on December 10th that year, on Delta Airlines. Isn't it weird how I remember that? I was allowed to talk to him long distance (which was way more expensive back then) every other weekend on Saturdays. We kept in touch even as his stepfather was relocated to Farmington Hills, Michigan, outside Detroit, and eventually to somewhere in New Jersey.     My last contact with him was during my seventh grade year, after I had become new best friends with Charles Kaake. Ryan came in town for a weekend visit. I never saw him again. It wasn't intentional, we both went on with our lives always thinking we'd be in touch again. We weren't. So, I've often wondered where he is and what's happened to him. I wonder if he has kids. I wonder what his brother Brett and Sister Kelly are doing. I wonder if his mom stayed married to his stepdad. I wonder if Ryan's father is still a hairdresser in Hamburg, New York...just outside Buffalo.    I keep my eyes peeled and figure I'll find him one day.

       Do you think it's possible to eradicate this cold I'm coming down with? I mean, I'm using every bit of organic & whole foods knowledge that I can get my hands on. I just juiced a lemon, a lime, one grapefruit, an orange and an apple into one hell of a vitimin C cocktail. Either my insides will dissolve due to the massive amount of citric acid, or this cold is a goner! Either way, I'll report the results tomorrow.

       Feeling a little woozy. I like the word woozy. Anyhow, I'm fighting this drainy-coldy thing which appeared out of nowhere yesterday. So, let's recap the weekend, shall we?   Friday   As mentioned in MBGL 53, Friday evening was lovely...complete with excellent company and fresh Maine lobster. However, I am beginning to think that this is where I picked-up my current cold bug. Phil was a little sniffly that evening, now that I look back.    Saturday   The show with Grandma was wonderful. The whole fam then had a nice dinner out, which is also unusual for Gran. Normally, she just likes to scoot straight home. However, on Saturday, we enjoyed a nice leisurely meal together before heading home. I met up with Kelly, we watched a few hours of the benefit concert, and then headed out to  Touch Supperclub,  just a few blocks away in our neighborhood. Touch was featuring a live salsa band and dancing. Kelly looked tres fabulous in her brand-spankin'-new outfit...very sexy! We ran into a couple of friends, John and Arlene. Arlene is married to a very close childhood friend Roy, who also happens to be an extremely gifted artist. Kelly and I spent the remainder of the night and early morning with John and Arlene before heading home.   Sunday   First, there was church. Then, I raced home to pick-up Toby and head over to Phil's where I was housesitting last night. After spending a few hours with his dog Rusty, I took Toby over to my parents' for a leisurely evening at home. We grilled Talapia and watched movies as the weather turned miserable. I drove back to Phil's in a torrential downpour and hit the hay early. I had to leave Phil's by 7:30 this morning in order to make it back into the city on time.   So, that's the weekend. Today, we're having a Marketing Dept. lunch in honor of Rachel's 30th at Sans Souci. That's it for the update. More later...

        my big gay life (53)    I'm kinda sorry that  The Music Man  will be picking up and leaving town tomorrow. Usually, I don't care too much one way or another...and many times I yell  GOOD RIDDANCE ! But somehow, this show and the wonderful people in it have managed to have a good effect on me. I'm actually going to miss them.  Shoot!  The performance this afternoon was terrific & Grandma loved the whole thing - she even talked about wanting to come down to the theatre again in December to see the Radio City Christmas show starring the Rockettes. This is a big deal because she hasn't wanted to make the trip to the theatre in a few years. After all, she's 94 years old. However, when she's feeling up to it, she loves to go downtown...so I guess we'll come back to see the Rockettes.     Last evening was really nice out at Phil's. Spending time with him and our friends Chris and Jim is always wonderful. The lobsters were delicious, the wine incredible and the conversation as hilarious as always. As it gets to be Autumn, I love to sit inside around the fireplace in the evenings with friends, telling stories, drinking wine and relaxing. I miss being outside, and I've managed to miss the Night Bike scheduled for this evening with hottie Ranger Doug from the National Park Service. Ah well...I'll have to catch him some other time. In the meanwhile, I have enough on my plate to keep me quite busy.     Kelly and I are going to check out this benefit concert thingie on tonight, then probably head out for a little partying. Hope you all have terrific Saturdays!!

       Thankfully, today passed in a flash. From the enormous settlement for  The Music Man , to the meetings today with several media companies, I'm a bit drained. But, what is this...a bitch and moan weblog? Hardly! I have a choir rehearsal this evening which is sure to boost my autumn blahs. We've been working on 18th Century music with some very sophisticated vocal arrangements. Funny how singing gets the endorphines going. I am hoping to make more major progress on my book assignment...maybe even finish reading that sucker tonight. Then, of course, there's the writing of the actual review. If I would just hunker-down and do it, I wouldn't have to be spending our time yapping about it. Forgive me.

       god, lots of stuff going on! I've been spending a lot of time talking to my mother who is dealing with the failing health of her best friend. Not easy stuff for a woman who has the health of her own mother and sister to keep her occupied. Grandma is 94 and still living independently...my Aunt has Parkinson's...so sometimes Mom feels, well...a lot of things. It gets to be a bit much at times. But, for today, she's in a good space...and for that, I am thankful. Still working on reviewing that book...I feel like I'm in college again and I've got a looming assignment. Better get to it...

How do I hide with no place to seek?   Standing on a limb at the edge of a line   Clutching at a heart thats not even mine      If words could tell the story   Speak the truth, decipher you   And even though I know the answer   I have questions, too      With so much confusion, its hard not to lose your way   Its hard not to lose   Its hard not to lose your way

        my big gay life (52)   Round-up! Everybody, circle your wagons! There was much drinking and debauchery this weekend. Between Rachel's birthday & my cousin being in town from Toronto...it's amazing my liver is functioning at all. There was drinking at Rachel's and at the Leather Stallion. There were even body shots, but I'm not saying who took off his shirt and lay down on the bar. On Sunday, there was the mandatory family gathering...lots of food and conversation before sending the Canadian family member home. Then, I went to perform a quick set from  The Sissy Show  at Cabaret Q...the variety show finale to the wonderful week known as  urlLink Out In Akron . By comparison, today's been a bit of a let-down. However, I celebrated my 5 year anniversary at work...so that's at least something. Right now, my nose should be deep in a book I'm reviewing for the Ohioana Journal...but I'm working on developing my procrastination skills. Yeah, like I need to work harder on that.

        my big gay life (51)    I may have the gayest job of all: I work non-stop in the world of touring musical theatre.  Hello!  More and more I find that less and less of my gay brethren are working in this field. I ask you:  where  are they? As the companies come rolling into town via train, bus or plane, one fact remais true: the good-looking ones are all straight. Alas, I would not want to find my next date in any crop of singer-dancers on tour. No No No! I learned early on that if you do date them, you may as well be wearing a mirror, because that's all they wanna look at, anyway!  Does this fitted, ribbed nipple-hugging chemise make me look fat?!  No baby...but it may cause you asphyxiation...no one should wear anything lycra that starts out the size of a washcloth. Not to say that all singer-dancers are so self-involved. However, if you can get beneath the surface...the omnipresent cloud of hairstyling products and mound Kenneth Cole shoes littered across the floor, I would be fascinated to know about it. Does the conversation ever leave the realm of glossy magazines, MTV's The Real World and club drugs? Just curious.

       I was walking with Charlie in the gutters of the idling steel mill. One one side of the murky, coffee-colored river was the old Republic Mill, churning and screeching, spewing molten ore, spewing the rhetoric of a core industry taken for granted, passed-by for things shinier and fast. On our side, quiet and steam. The hum like a nuclear reactor, a sleeping giant waiting to come back to life. The West Side Mill is on "hot-idle," meaning it's easier to get back into steel production than if it was completely shut down. So, it idles there, waiting to reawaken, waiting to forge ahead...waiting to deliver cold, hard steel, paychecks and dreams, college educations and IRA's. The few trees remaining around the mills, or those stubborn enough to take root after the place was built, drop leaves in the autumn chill, others cling desperately to branches. A brown dust has settled over everything, and it's hard to imagine anything ever being clean.

       My day is half over...I've managed to keep my eyes open with the help of a few strong cups of java. I arrived at the Palace this morning at 5:45. Alone, I walked the stage and out into the darkened house. It took just a few minutes for my eyes to adjust to the dim light thrown into the house from the ghost light on stage. The chandeliers were dark, the sconces black...only oddly-shaped shadows loomed in the space. When the stagehands arrived and turned on the houselights, chandeliers and sconces, the shadows retreated and the stage came to life. This was all in preparation for a live TV shoot. One by one, the handful of sleepy actors and stage managers arrived to appear on live television, talk, sing, dance...and yes...even play trombone...all in the hopes of selling a few tickets. So, at this point in the day, I feel like having lunch.   Last night, I escorted Gerritt VanderMeer, the actor playing Harold Hill, to the WEWS studios for a live television news interview. He reminded me what gracious and grateful actors are like...sweet, thoughful and genuine. He may not be a household name at this point...but keep your eyes peeled...I am certain you'll be seeing more of him.

        birthday girl   Today is Kelly's birthday soiree hosted by yours truly. I've been up cleaning and decluttering and reorganizing since 8am. I went to bed last night during a fierce rain/windstorm, and woke up to a nice leak in my family room ceiling. Ah, the freakin' joys of homeownership!! Not to fear, however, as many of you know...I'm great with drywall, spackle and paint. It just never seems to end. So, tonight...Ms. Kel's friends will stop over for wine, beer and munchies...very low-key and relaxing - just what the Doctor ordered.

        Pomade...   I should have known! This morning, I was running late...disastrously late. I nearly somersaulted down my steep and shallow staircase, slid across the hardwood floor and knocked my head into the downstairs bathroom doorframe. What a great way to start the day. The typical end to my morning ablutions is the application of some hair product, be it gel, wax, mud or pomade. Today, I couldn't find any of my regular products, so I reached for this random and unassuming tube of gel, dispensed some into the palm of my left hand and vigorously applied it to by beautiful chestnut locks. The gel quickly cemented my hair into a dazzling retro-swoop...like the "up" part of a pompadour, but with my very short sides. Spectacular! And, it was frozen in place to boot! Nothing except hot water and shampoo was going to unlock this puppy. As I scrambled out the door, I managed to catch the newspaper mid-fling from the paper boy without even stopping. Things were looking up! Then I realized...I was using Billy Flynn's pomade...the very gel I used through the entire run of  Chicago . No wonder I have my sh*t together today! You go, Billy!     All I care about is love...

        Notes from the farm...   There were leaves falling from the trees by the time I returned to the farm that Autumn. It had been five years since I had last helped in the Dairy with the Holsteins, or fed the barn cats or even helped with the Maple-sugaring. I always enjoyed working out in the Maple forest collecting the sap from the buckets attached to the trees...dumping the watery contents into the 200-gallon tank as the mares Hannah and Estelle pulled the hitch through the trees. When we got to the Sugar House, the sap was drained into the evaporator, where the water was cooked off, leaving only the dense, amber maple syrup. But, that was a late winter task. This was fall, and there were many jobs to complete before sundown. The cows needed their stalls mucked-out, and Macy, the Arabian, desperately needed a brushing and a good long run in the yard. Swingo, the family mutt, and I headed toward the barn and the incessant cluck-clucking of the chickens, who never seemed to be in their pen. As they wandered pecking at the ground, Swingo chased after them, herding them toward the coop. It wasn't the most glamorous work, but it needed doing. It was rewarding in a physical and immediate way. After all these years, the chores felt somehow comforting...somehow defining things in black and white. On the farm, you do the things that need doing...or animals don't eat, get ill or worse. It's that simple. And in that simplicity, life makes a little more sense.

        Ranger Doug     "This is Todd"     "Hi, uh, this is Doug. The front desk transferred me."     "Pamela's good that way," I said.     "We met the other night on the Harvest Moon Hike. I work for the National Park Service."     "Oh right! You were videotaping the Ranger guy."     "Yeah, that's me. Listen, I hope you don't mind me calling. I saw the Playhouse Square logo on your shirt and thought you might work there...so that's how I found you. I'm really not a stalker."     "I'm impressed! Good deductive skills!"     "I really enjoyed talking to you the other night and wanted to know if we could get together sometime...maybe go for coffee or a hike. Dinner maybe?"     "I had a great time, too! I'd love to grab dinner, coffee or a hike sometime. Definitely."     "Great! (pause) Wow. I was nervous."

       Can I just tell you how much I enjoyed the hike tonight?! To my surprise, over 100 people showed up for the hike at the Oak Hill Trailhead in Peninsula...which happens to be just down the road from my Aunt & Uncle's farm. The twilight hike was programmed to demonstrate how the forest changes from day to night...the types of animals that come out, the different sounds...the way our eyes adjust perfectly. We had no flashlights or lanterns, but could find our way without trouble. At the end of the hike, the Harvest Moon was rising over the forest. It started out low in the sky, rotund and orange-yellow. Within fifteen minutes, it had gained significant altitude and was blazing white. One of my fellow hikers lent me her binoculars to get a closer look at our magnificent moon. The evening was punctuated by the presence of a couple of trail hotties of undetermined sexual orientation...not to mention Doug, a gift from the National Park Service...tall, dark and yummy. He's leading a Night Bike later in the month. Looks like I'm going to have to buy a headlight for my bike. Color me  there.

       This weekend seemed like a blur. Palooza was a giant success this past Sunday. We had over 8,000 people come down and participate in our free community open house. On Sunday evening I had my first rehearsal for the annual church Christmas Madrigal...this is my fourth year singing in the show, and I love it! Rehearsals are easy...only twice a week for two hours, so it barely seems like work. Sunday night we celebrated Kelly's birthday by watching our regular line-up" Queer As Folk and Leap Years...and by indulging in a little chocolate mousse. I am going to go on the "Harvest Moon Hike" down in the Park tonight...so I'm really looking forward to that. At the moment, all is well...and I can't be more thankful.

        garons endommags (damaged boys)     part eight    There were five of them in the rowhouses across the street. Underneath the sheen of public normalcy and personal splendour lives the gaping damage within.     Ben accelerated the speed on the treadmill. Watching Marcus had become the focal point of his workouts lately, and when he wasn't actually with Marcus, he'd fantasized about seeing him there. Watching him lift weights or run a six minute mile or smile back at him. It was so complicated, living next door to the perfect guy, the one guy he'd wanted in more than a year. As far as he could tell, Marcus had ruined him for other men, and they had yet to taste each other...sweet salty lips pressed together softly, like velvet. He'd thought about it, though. Thought about it a lot. It wasn't that he was obsessed, it was that Marcus became an unobtainable object. Even with their frequent trips to the gym, or their occasional dinner and movie at their respective homes, there had been no romantic connection, and it vexed Ben.    Ben was average in height, lean and beautiful of face. His white smile both dazzled and charmed. His jet black hair was closely cropped, and his polar blue eyes could spellbind anyone. Anyone and everyone except Marcus who never seemed to notice. Marcus who never seemed to notice the coy glances, the sweet smiles and generosity. He never seemed to notice anything about Ben at all. He'd seemingly missed or was unimpressed by Ben's career as a top-notch marketing manager at University Hospital System or his recent MBA degree. Marcus who never seemed to notice the incredible person living next door...the handsome, stable, successful and single Ben.   But Marcus had noticed. He'd noticed it right away, and he'd filed the information away in a compartment. Not throwing it away, just relocating it for later reference, later action. Right now, Marcus was too busy being perfect. Too busy being what everyone else needed him to be...everyone except himself...and Ben. He knew Ben was interested, but it was easier to just live in limbo...not to talk about it. Surely talking would just make everything weird. For now, they could spend time together without worrying about expectations. If he asked Ben out on a real date, there would suddenly be expectations...more demands. If Marcus decided anything else, things would just get weird. So, it was better, in his estimation, to keep things the same: ambiguous.    When he'd reached thirty minutes on the treadmill, he stepped off, sprayed it down with disinfectant and moved his pile of keys, sweats and gym ID over to the floormats, where he'd complete a grueling set of crunches, sit-ups and push-ups. By then, Marcus would be done with his squats and it would be time to head home and ready for work.    "You keep those crunches up, Ben...they're making you rock solid!"   Ben smiled as he panted out a brief "Thanks."  "I'm ready when you are. No rush."   No, of course not...there was no rushing at all with Marcus. No rushing. Just patience. But Ben had patience...lots of it. He picked up his things and headed to the front where Marcus was waiting, chatting-up and charming the receptionist. They piled into the car and set off toward home, listening to NPR and dreaming of the day's first cup of coffee.    Marcus parked the car in his garage and lowered the garage door. He turned to Ben, smiled, and kissed him full on the lips.   "What?"  "Shhh."

        my big gay life (55)     I guess it's more about blog housekeeping at this point, but I wanted to update you on my weekend. I'm glad to be back at work so things will slow down a bit. Here's the recap:   Wednesday    Meet Kelly and Mark to go out and celebrate. We head to the Lava Lounge in Tremont, where our collective cars get towed to some random lot. The three of us contact the towing company, and Kelly manages to persuade them to release our cars on the spot for the required fee ($102) in cash money per car. Otherwise, we'd have been stuck til 7am Thanksgiving. So, finally reunited with our cars...we drive home and drink heavily.    Thursday   Thanksgiving arrives with a prayer that I have enough gas to get me to my parents (who will them fork over some much needed cash to cover me til today). The day is fast and furious with lots of family over.     Friday   Doug and I hit the studio for the first time in weeks. We revise one of our songs for a submission request, and waddle through an enormous pond of legal/copyright paperwork. Later, I meet an old friend who was in town from LA. We went out to The Flying Fig for a drink, and then back to my place for some, well, nevermind. All I can say is: "Happy Thanksgiving!"   Saturday   I spent the early evening through the early morning with the ex love of my life and one of my very best friends, Lee. ( urlLink Andrew  is familiar with Lee, having played him in a one-act I wrote). Anyhow, we spent the evening catching-up, having a delightful dinner with his parents and then, finally, going out and hitting the clubs for old time's sake. What a terrific night! We had a blast running into old friends and making a few new ones...including a pair of brothers who wanted me to come home with me...(I said no). Lee and I have such a deep bond and we miss each other intensely when we're not together, but I will always be grateful for his friendship, and he, mine.    Sunday   I slept in as late as I could (10:30am) and then slugged around the house for the better part of the day. Besides a trip to the grocery and one to rehearsal, I stayed inside all day. Last night, Dr. Tom came over for a visit to watch Sex and the City and Queer as Folk.

        garons endommags (damaged boys)      part seven   There were five of them in the rowhouses across the street. Underneath the sheen of public normalcy and personal splendour lives the gaping damage within.     It was rainy and the type of horrible November morning he'd come to hate - intensely. Between the coffee fix that didn't work anymore and his inability to purchase the chemical enhancements which helped him deal with the day to day, Corey managed to stumble into the bathroom to ready for the day of rehearsals and the opening performance of  Romeo and Juliet . There would be no time for irregularities today. The ballet master Patrice would be keeping a keen watch on all of the dancers, watching and waiting for errors, waiting for the opportunity to repress, oppress and/or scold and dancer who was not performing up to par that day. Patrice was harsh, demanding and cold. He could reduce a dancer to tears in less than five seconds. Corey thrived on the perfection, the demands, the sharp tongue. For Corey, it meant being absolutely focused on every movement. It meant hiding his secret delight from even his best friends in the corps. It meant not disclosing that he'd been hired on the spot by Metro Escorts. Well, hired after displaying the goods he had to offer potential clients. From his chiseled physique to his enviable endowment, Corey had wowed the boys at Metro, so much so that they'd offered him and exclusive arrangement immediately. Certainly, it was to their benefit to list one of the principal dancers from the city's ballet company as one of their own. Whoring was more or less all about cache, and Corey had exactly the background considered most desireable: educated, healthy, fit and sexually gifted. Indeed, there was money to be made, and money would certainly roll in once Coery became available to Metro's exclusive client list.   Corey smiled as he stepped under the searing streams of water jetting from the locker room shower. He would visit his first client that night immediately after the performance. How delicious to think after making his debut as Paris in  Romeo and Juliet  he would be entertaining a wealthy ballet patron on his own terms, in his own way and without criticism. Performing to the extent of his abilities, he would feel true freedom in his actions, and pocket a healthy sum of cash in the process. It all seemed scandalously simple.    Corey executed his choreography perfectly throughout the performance. He'd nailed his dances technically, and artistically, he'd performed with remarkable finesse. He was satisfied and aroused, thinking about his secret rendezvous later that night. After the cast party, after the accolades, he would rely simply on himself, his body and his insatiable sense of sexuality. Then, he would prove himself, make himself worthy.   It was nearly midnight when he rang the doorbell at 4006 Clinton Avenue. The darkness and quiet threw him for a moment. He stepped off of the porch toward his car when the door opened.  "Wait."  Corey wheeled around to face a shadowy figure in the doorframe.  "It's you. I shouldn't be surprised you're a whore. Selling your best asset, your body. Come inside. Now."  Corey stepped inside the house as Patrice closed the door behind him.  "Where shall we begin, Corey? First position?"

        garons endommags (damaged boys)      part six - Braden   There were five of them in the rowhouses across the street. Underneath the sheen of public normalcy and personal splendour lives the gaping damage within.    It wasn't enought that Scotty had left in a fit of tears this morning, but Braden somehow needed to tell Kyle it was time to go, too. He'd been seeing both of them on and off for a month, and things were getting a little too tight for Braden's taste. Too many close calls. Too many near misses. He dialed the phone, and when Kyle answered, Braden simply said "Come over" and disconnected. He calculated that it would take Kyle no longer than 25 minutes to get there. He could have the "hit the bricks" conversation said and done within five or six minutes. It all depended on his reaction. That was the nasty variable in all this...the was absolutely no way to predict how Kyle would react. That was the messy part. It was completely untidy and horrible. But, when it was over, Braden's life returned to pure white, with only minor shades of grey that were easily cleaned and juxtaposed.   Kyle arrived amid a flurry of loud and rapacious knocking on the door. The kind of knocking that left smudges of dirty handprints on the otherwise pristine paint. Braden sauntered to the foyer and opened the door.  "Why do you have to call up and be like that?! Just saying 'come over' and hanging up on me?! What the fuck is that about??"  "You came."  "Jesus, baby...what's wrong? You sound all cold and shit. What's the matter?"  "It isn't working anymore. We're not working anymore. It's time for you to go."  Kyle looked at him, staring in disbelief. He blinked and said, "Are you kidding me?"  "No. This shirt is yours. You left it here last week."  "That's it?! That's all you're going to say??"  "Yeah. Guess so." Braden turned and headed back toward the kitchen. "Don't forget to pull the door tight on your way out" and disappeared around the corner. Kyle stood in the foyer for a moment, shocked. He stepped outside into the cold November evening and slammed the door shut behind him. The next bus home wouldn't be by for another twenty minutes. As he sat on the front porch steps, tears began streaming down his cheeks. At the age of twenty, he felt foolish for his childish display.    Daniel drove up to the garage, furiously pressing the button on his garage door opener to no avail. He parked the car in the drive and saw Kyle sitting on Braden's front porch.   "Hey! If he's not there you can wait inside here if you like."  Daniel couldn't believe the words came out of his mouth. What was he doing inviting this sketchy twentysomething into his house? But something inside Daniel wanted to know more about Braden, and looking at his trash was one way. "No, he's there. I'm just...waiting for the bus back home...he told me to..."  "Told you to what?"  "Leave."  "Oh. Sorry 'bout that. Well, have a nice night." Daniel turned and walked toward his door.   "Hey mister..."  "Daniel."  "Daniel. Umm. Thanks anyway. You're a nice guy. Too bad more guys ain't like you."  "Like me how?"  "You know, real nice and good looking, too. How come I ain't seen you around in the bars?"  "I'm married."  "Still, you're too hot to be all snatched-up by one person. Why aren't you a little more generous with yourself? Why won't you share? " Kyle backed up against the garage door with a sly grin on his face. Grasping desperately at his last remaining shreds of self-esteem.  "I'm not gay."  "Then why do you keep looking at me that way?"  "What way?!"  "Come on, touch me...you want to."  Daniel grabbed Kyle by the neck and slammed him up against the garage door fiercely. "I'm not a homo, you little faggot! You little piece of trash!"  Daniel thrust his tongue into Kyle's mouth, pressing him hard against the door, groping him like a teenager at a drive-in. His arousal won over the shame raging within. He hated this kid, he hated himself...and he loved it all at once.

        garons endommags (damaged boys)     part five - Ben   There were five of them in the rowhouses across the street. Underneath the sheen of public normalcy and personal splendour lives the gaping damage within.    Ben was already five minutes late when he considered phoning Marcus. They were due at the gym at 5:30 and he needed just five more minutes to get ready. At a modest 5'8" Ben worried constantly about his appearance, although he thought nothing of mowing the lawn in little more than shorts and Birkenstocks...with athletic socks. He had jet black hair which was kept at medium length. It looked stylishly tousled or coiffed depending on the circumstances. Like Corey, he made a zealous commitment to hitting the gym daily. He was in top shape, nicely muscled, but not bulky. Ben was a little jealous of Marcus' natural looks...his relaxed style and his delicious masculinity, but spending twice a week in the gym with him was more than enough to make up for it. He loved spending the time with Marcus, even if not a word was spoken.    He'd spent many mornings in the gym spotting Marcus on the bench press, or running quietly, contemplatively next to him on the treadmill. The pounding of shoes and the whir of the motor droning delivered them into another zone together, and Ben relished every moment. He'd wondered why next-door neighbors could be so close, but not really know very much about each other at all. He thought they should really change that. He'd have to invite him over for dinner and to watch the game sometime. Maybe they could shoot pool. Marcus liked pool, yes, he was certain of it. He'd heard stories about Marcus and his work friends going to Cues on Friday nights. He caught himself imagining Marcus half-bent over the pool table preparing for a tough shot. But Ben was already late as it was. He needed to get next door before Marcus left without him.   It was 2:30am and he needed to be up at 5 to go to the gym with Ben. Marcus had been tossing and turning all night worried about the same stupid stuff he'd always worried about: finances, his family and doing what was expected of him. He'd grown weary of always being the rock...being everyone's rock. He grew weary of exceeding expectations, and never disappointing. It was as if he'd awaken from a long sleep to find himself living parts of everyone else's lives. Who was he? He thought maybe it was time to get back to the shrink. He'd never told anyone before, because no one would have believed it, but he found it useful. Maybe it was time again. He'd call from the office...no...he'd call from the road, that way no one would be any the wiser. As much fun as the gang from work was, they knew everything...they listened too well, and they talked too much.   And just what was it about Ben that he'd found so intriguing? Maybe it was his silence. Yes, it was Ben's ability to be completely still and peaceful even at the gym. Ben had never asked him what he was doing that weekend, who he was dating or where he was going. Ben wasn't enamored with Marcus...everyone's good-time buddy. No, it was easy being around Ben. And while he knew Ben was a good six inches shorter, he still had strength and great endurance...he'd be a holy menace on the rugby field. He'd have to remind himself to ask Ben if he'd like to come to rugby sometime. Come to think of it he might be good at soccer and basketball...   Marcus drifted back into a fitful slumber.   Ben rang the doorbell for the third time. He looked at his watch...5:40am. There were no lights on. He wondered if Marcus had left without him. No, he would have seen my lights, Ben told himself. He rang the bell again, and heard Moby start barking and another muffled sound from within...a muffled stream of obscenities as Marcus tore down the stairs to the front door.  "Ben, I am so sorry...I totally overslept...gimme just a minute to throw on my sweats."  "No problem, I was running behind schedule today, too."  "I slept for shit last night. Kept waking up."  "God, I hate that."  "Yeah, couldn't get back to sleep, and when I finally do...I'm in a coma and don't hear my alarm."  "I though maybe you left without me."  "Nah, just couldn't get my lazy ass outta bed is all. Ready?"  "Yep, let's hit it."   Marcus and Ben slipped into the Audi and drove into the pitch black morning.   Each with a question on his lips...

        garons endommags (damaged boys)    part four - Marcus   There were five of them in the rowhouses across the street. Underneath the sheen of public normalcy and personal splendour lives the gaping damage within.    Marcus was, at first glance, the complete picture of fitness and masculinity. He was tall, well-muscled and lean. His thick chestnut hair was cropped short. He could dazzle anyone with a flash of his brilliant white smile and twinkle of his exotic green eyes. He was very social, played rugby and soccer in the fall, basketball in the winter and baseball all spring and summer. He was aggressive and competitive in nature, but not at all disliked. In fact, Marcus had a constant swarm of people around him day and night...waiting for the next witty comment...waiting for him to smile upon them. Waiting to be the object of his favour. The guys at work considered him a god - after all, he outsold them all three to one, and was the highest producer in the region for phamaceutical sales. The women at work considered him a gift from God - after all, he had never slept with any of them and not called the next day. Marcus was a winner.    And...there was a deep and enduring sadness which was barely traceable...   When he reached home that evening after rugby practice, his Yellow Lab, Moby, greeted him at the door...his nails clicking loudly on the tilework in the foyer.  "Hey good boy! How's my best dog? How's Moby?!"  Moby continued to dance excitedly until Marcus let him out to run in the fenced backyard. He ran three complete laps until catching the scent of something fascinating near the hydrangea. Marcus checked his messages. One from his sister, and one from Daniel next door, wondering if he would be attending the local Republican fundraiser tomorrow night.  No he would not.  He grabbed Sam Adams Pale Ale and sauntered into the den. Sinking into the deep cushions of the couch, he flicked on Sports Center to catch up on the scores, and fell immediately asleep.    Marcus woke with a start to the sound of Moby barking at the door. He turned off the television, let the dog inside and headed upstairs to bed. Moby darted up the stairs past him, and into the bedroom. He completed his evening ablutions as if competing on an agility course...face, teeth, contact lenses, undress. This evening, he caught a glimpse of himself naked in the mirror...not believing it was really him...realizing he had never really looked at himself. Not recognizing the person looking back at him.   He pulled back the covers and slipped quietly asleep.

        garons endommags (damaged boys)    part three - Corey   There were five of them in the rowhouses across the street. Underneath the sheen of public normalcy and personal splendour lives the gaping damage within.    The timer had already kicked the coffee pot into high gear by the time Corey managed to drag himself out of bed at 5:30. He padded quietly into the bathroom to shower. The hotter, the better he thought as he turned the faucet to full-tilt. His muscles ached the soft, delicious ache of a particularly grueling workout. His life as a dancer in the city's premier ballet company demanded that he be in the best shape physically at all times. At 31, he was on the downhill side of his career, as year by year his cartilage wore ever thinner and less durable. He was required to lift, carry and toss ballerinas around the stage...something which had been easier when he was nineteen.    He stepped into the blazing warmth of the shower and let the water stream over him, letting the heat penetrate. He was in the best shape of his life, muscular and flexible, strong and limber...chiseled. He'd worked long hours in rehearsal studios and gyms to achieve his present physicality. He was, however, not particularly handsome...in the traditional sense. His face was pocked, his nose large and he sported the most uncooperative and bristly brown hair, which was, in fact, in need of cutting.    Corey shaved and dressed for the day, black jeans, tight ribbed turtleneck and black leather shoes with silver buckles. He poured his coffee and sat down at the kitchen table...really no more than a counter built out from the wall, and opened up the weekly alternative newspaper. He quickly flipped to the rear sections and began thumbing through the classified advertising. He circled three ads which piqued his interest, and transferred the telephone numbers into his daily planner. He would call later in the day and leave messages.    Corey always enjoyed Company class...the opportunity for the entire company of dancers, apprentices through the prima ballerinas, to warm-up, to learn and to stretch and strengthen. Corey loved the discipline, the consistency of routine since he was twelve. He watched his every movement in the mirror, his every angle...he also watched Christopher, the gorgeous blonde apprentice from California. Every bit the surfer-boy type, Christopher seemed to defy gravity...his grace was unparralled and his strength unequalled among the entire corps. Christopher caught Corey's glance and smiled.    After lunch hour, Corey caught up to Christopher.  "Hey Chris, I found that ad you'd mentioned."  "Yeah? Did you call?"  "Left a message during lunch."  "Cool. They'll call you soon...I told them to expect you. They'll just want to talk to you for a little, and if they like you, they'll want to meet you in person, you know...just to make sure you're what they're looking for. I told them not to worry."  "Thanks. It just seems, I don't know...is it tough?"  "First time's a little weird, but you'll get into it. Especially the money."  "Well, I'll let you know what happens."  "Do."  Christopher walked out of the locker room and back into the studio.    When Corey arrived home that evening, the message light on his phone was blinking. He called his voicemail and retrieved a message from Ryan at Metro Escorts.

       Crazy! It's been awhile since I've been able to update, but I finally managed to write that book review. So far, no word from my editor...which I guess is good..unless she's too busy marking it up with a red pen to email me. We'll see. Anyway, it feels great to have that out of the way.  Whew!  It gets published in January, so I'll be sure to post a copy of my glorious contribution to Ohioana Journal. In other news, we're busy electing a new Mayor and City Council...so Kelly and I have rounds and rounds of political parties to attend this evening... (insert haughty snort here)

        garons endommags (damaged boys)    part two - Daniel   There were five of them in the rowhouses across the street. Underneath the sheen of public normalcy and personal splendour lives the gaping damage within.    Daniel had noticed Braden first when he was taking out the garbage on Friday morning. He noticed his ease of motion, Braden's quiet, seemless poetry of movement from the garage to the curb and back. Each time, toting heavy garbage bags filled with the detritus of Braden's life. Living with obsessive-compulsive disorder meant trash days were always robust. Daniel noticed the systematic precision as Braden moved. Although handsome, he'd never be picked out of a crowd. Daniel caught himself staring an instant too long, and found himself flushed, embarrassed. But Braden had not seen him.  Good.  Jeanine would be leaving for work soon, leaving Daniel at home alone for an hour before, he too, would leave for work.   Daniel worked as a consultant for an ultra-conservative political think tank. His days were filled with strategy sessions, tactical public relations offensives and power lunches with leading politicos and key influencers. He had been raised in the South, and he was proud of his rich heritage. Born the son of a South Carolina State Senator and an Assistant State Attorney General, politics was a way of life. It coursed through him. Educated at Wake Forest in North Carolina, he'd met Jeanine at a political fundraiser for Sen. Jesse Helms in the early Nineties. She hailed from Greenville, South Carolina, and was the product of a decent and well-liked family. She was pretty enough, and it was expected that he would marry. He would marry someone from an acceptable background, acceptable family. And during his grad school days at William and Mary, they grew closer.  Close enough to fuck on a regular basis. It was dutiful, unfulfilling and protestant. She'd said yes because he'd told her he loved her, and he'd loved the sheer control, the forcefulness, the rage. And she simply took it, because she was amazed that anyone could love her, that he could see beyond her cherubic exterior. He didn't. He'd replaced her in his own mind with some fantasy, some perfectly-shaped beauty Jeanine could never be. He told himself this was normal.    He'd thought about Braden...about his appalling homosexuality. How could he justify the endless stream of rough trade in and out of his house? How could he think it was acceptable in the eyes of God? Daniel imagined Braden...doing  that  with those young men...imagined the sound...imagined the illicit, the forbidden act. The touching...the kissing. And it disgusted him.

        garons endommags  (damaged boys)    part one - Braden    There were five of them in the rowhouses across the street. Underneath the sheen of public normalcy and personal splendour lives the gaping damage within.   Braden lived on the east end of the structure. His tidiness went unnoticed, except to the occasional visitor, or trick. His penchant for orderliness coupled with his obsessive-compulsive disorder made for an interesting package. At 29, he was a successful accountant, friendly and chatty...although socially awkward and inappropriate at times.  His behavior ranged from general, generic politeness, to an unjustified familiarity with everyone on the street. Neighbors would wave hello and then dart inside as to avoid conversation. Once trapped, you might be forced to carry on an inane discussion for the better part of an hour. It was much wiser to simply acknowledge him, and move inside. No one really knew him, but they observed him, noting his habits, his tastes and opinions. They kept a mental database. Watching. Noting.   He liked younger men, in general, scruffy with facial hair and tousled locks. The types without fathers, young 19 and 20 year-olds without much experience...boys looking to become men...the boy-men from ghetto streets, from broken homes, from abuse and injustice. From illiteracy. He took them all in at one time or another. To feed and protect them, to be their savior for a night. To love them physically. He promised love and pleasure intertwined...delivering himself inside...making them fall deliriously in love with him.   And they had loved him, of couse. They had loved him a thousand times over, but it was never enough. Some of them had loved him genuinely, but it was never enough to let them stay, to let them get closer, or let them get inside at all. When he was finished with them...after one night, or a week or even a month, he pitched them out like the week's garbage, only to be collected by such men who comb the gutters looking for....things. Or lovers. He discarded all of them because none could fit into the strict compartments of his life. If you didn't fit into the medicine cabinet, or in the wardrobe, there was no space for you. And so, they'd leave, each time with heads low, or screaming or crying or saying nothing at all. And Braden would just stand inside the door, peering out, making sure the trash was collected. Nothing was permanent there, although he seemed to long for it. And he would stand there looking out at the street, half expecting something to happen, knowing he could do nothing to break his own cycle. It would only be days until another one would be lured there under the same pretenses...and dismissed of in the same manner. Braden's disposable boys. Like remaindered books and retail sale racks...damaged goods.   Daniel would see them, too. He lived at the opposite end of the rowhouse with his wife, Jeanine. As they would go through the mundane routine of their lives together, Daniel would notice the boys. He'd noticed Braden, too. He'd noticed and he'd wondered secretly...

       In my neighborhood, we celebrate  Ghettoween . Ghettoween is a hybrid event which features the synthesis of traditional trick-or-treating, bad costumes, the homeless, mob mentality and occasional gang violence...all squished between the hours of 6 and 8pm. Celebrating Ghettoween requires that you sit out in front of your house in order to pass out candy while avoiding tennis-elbow from opening your front door 350 times...because, believe me, that's how many people stop by on our block. Being in front of your house also allows you to keep an eye on everything going down on the block...from cute 2-year olds dressed as Dorothy, to pre-teens hurling eggs at motorists and passers-by. Keeping a post in front of your house at least lets you see the egg as it hurtles toward your house, as opposed to having to discover it the next morning. Ghettoween is one night a year that really brings the community together...just like All Saints Day, November 1, when we're all back outside bonding...doing things like cleaning up eggs, toilet paper and smooshed candy from our front yards. Hope everyone had a great Ghettoween & I'll see you outside later...broom in hand!

       goodbye 2001...    goodbye  urlLink Dan      goodbye Billy:   Goodnight CHICAGO...  glimpses from closing night    Claire, the lady in the box office I won't see for awhile. The houseboards, marquee and lobby displays disassembled. The final audience buzzing with excitement, wanting the elusive magic of the final performance. The dressing rooms, once homey and lived-in, now cluttered and torn apart as we prepare to take our things home. The sign-in sheet on the callboard now full. Clips, reviews, photos and various sign-up sheets tattered, worn at the edges. Props: umbrellas, newspapers, old-fashioned cameras holding on for one last performance. Spike tape and glow tape just as it was during tech...some of it replaced after heavy traffic. The orchestra warming-up. The techies prepping the sets, lights and special effects. Listening to the Overture one last time. Seeing each cast member take the stage for their final show. Standing alone behind the center upstage door awaiting my entrance Is everybody here!? Is everybody ready!?. Seeing Roxy's bowler hat lower from the flies during "Roxy." Watching everyone watching everyone else...taking inventory of the faces and the experience so we won't forget any of it. Being surprised at just how emotional our final show is for me. Standing with Pam (Roxy) on the empty courtroom set and saying "Well, I guess that's it for you and me..." and really feeling my own subtext. Singing my final note, slamming the center upstage door...and losing my shit. Standing with the company stage left hugging and kissing each other during "Nowadays." Taking my final bow. Restoring my costumes and props to their cases and boxes. Cleaning my area of the dressing room. Watching the set disassembled and removed. Saying goodbye to everyone one last time. Being told goodbye one last time. Walking out past the marquee...already advertising the next show. Without a trace...CHICAGO was gone. As I walked away from the theater, and into the center of town, I realized I'll miss Billy Flynn most of all. So, if you see him...give him my regards. I'll miss ya, pal.    It's just a noisy hall where there's a nightly brawl    and all that jazz...    :: todd stuart 19.8.01 [+] ::      Goodbye Miss Girlene...   see you all in '02

        starting home     Today was the last/first day here at Bridge House. Kelly and I spent her last night sitting in the family room and drinking wine until the wee hoursjust like we always have, and I expect that part will never change...its just that one of us will be going  home  instead of staying there.     The move has been one of the easiest and best-organized Ive ever had the pleasure of participating inand anyone who knows me the least little bit knows how I loathe moving other people. But, this was very different. I never once felt obligated to helpI needed to help. I needed to be able to help close up shop and reorganize as a way of figuring out my own next step. See, while Kelly moved into her new house and had to arrange her new settingso did I.     I came home today after she was all moved (minus a few bits and pieces still scattered here) and began cleaning and rearranging things in a new waykeeping some things quite the same. But, it felt like moving into a new house altogether. Finally, the five days of upheaval had come to an end, and the dust was settlingfiguratively and literally.     There were gorgeous hardwood floors to clean with buckets full of Murphysthere were dishes to be washed and laundry to be doneand one disastrous room to be tidied. There was the plotting and arranging of how things would be from now onfinally realizing there was a true line of demarcation:  then  and  now/future . Everything from this point forward would be post-Kellya concept I havent really managed to get my arms around yet.  Kelly is my best friend. She is the person who knows me better than anyone else at this point in my life, and I have to acknowledge how scary it is to be without her here, at arms length. She has been my confidant and friend, my therapist and my family. She has been my sense of reason and humility, dignity and grace. She has been my constant support and my loudest cheerleader. She is as entertaining as she is beautifuland she is as gorgeous on the inside as she is on the outside. She is my sister, and one of the greatest loves of my life. And, I suspect, as many people have, that we will find new paths and new people to color our lives, as we have given each other room to do so.     Bridge House was our adventure together...thank you, Kelly, for an incredible journey   With love,   Todd

        unpacking boxes  v 2.0  for Kelly   There is the undoing of an entire household. Separations, inventories and decisions...which objects are staying, and which will go to the next place. There are the tangible items, and even more, there are memories. The last time I spent any time at all in the basement, besides laundry, was a few years ago as Kelly packed up and moved a few miles away. It was as much a time for me to clean, discard, reorganize as it was for me to simply remember. Just thinking of all that's changed in three years since her departure has me reeling and dizzy with choked-up emotion.  I know this bittersweet feeling from once before...leaving college. And while I have tried to express what that last day felt like for me, I have never been able to find words. For me, it was a complicated web of emotions much to difficult and sweet to actually sort out. So I left it alone...neatly packed in boxes in my basement. So, now...I'm opening them and wading through the flood.   We leave ourselves behind in pieces. Shards of history in dusty corners and under the sofa cushions. We leave bits of truth and scraps of lies in linen closets and under the sink in the bathroom. These are parts of a life unvisited, seen only by the landlord or cleaning crew long after departure.  I graduated University in late summer, long after my fellow friends and classmates in June. I spent my last weeks there relatively alone, pondering the future, pondering what everyone ponders when leaving someplaceleaving someplace significant. I think I was glad that shed gone, my roommate and close friend of many years. Like the rest, shed gone north to spend the summer with her family. Shed return at the end of summer quarter to help me pack up and clean. I would move home, she would move into another apartment and continue school.  I wasnt sure what came next, and I spent the summer thinking about it, trying to decipher my own personal mystery.  The trees, which lined East Frambes were old and fat with life, their canopy stretching nearly a mile uninterrupted. I walked to the end of the street where it intersected High and waited for the bus. Sometimes immersing myself in anonymity helped, helped me not to think too much. I watched the old ladies counting change and buttons in their coin purses. I watched black boys tease black girls and talk smack. I watched crazy men mutter to everyone and no one. I started talking aloud to myself, watching people watch me.  We passed the Short North galleries and pubs and all the pretty, happy wonderful peopleperking along the sidewalk, chirping to each other or into cell phones. They walk briskly in Kenneth Cole shoes and wear clothes the color of charcoal.  Sometimes Id just walk, walk for hours across campus or across town. I wanted to take all of it in before Id leave. I knew that once I graduated, Id be gone for a very long while. My four years had too many highs and too many lows for it not to be painful leaving, or to return. And, in all this aloneness, Id come to find a slow torture where everything became melancholic. Everything reminded me of something else. And yet, I couldnt turn away from itI had to steep in it, to understand every momentexperience it and catalog it for future reference. What once was a campus bustling with thousands of students was dark and quietserene.  I walked to Park Hall, my first residence on campus, and looked up at the eleven-story building, standing empty, and checked it off my list of good-byes.  The morning I graduated started on the floor, as my bed was already packed and shipped home. I readied for commencement and donned my cap and gown. I walked to St. John alone and took my place next to the other students in my linenone were even familiar to me.  I graduated alone in a sea of strangers, and met my family afterwards outside. As they took pictures and chattered about the occasion, my mind drifted to all the people and places I had come to know and loveall the things which would become part of my history.  We lunched at the Mohawk, my favorite bar and restaurant before heading back to my apartment to pack the last few armfuls of college detritus. Nothing felt right anymore. I didnt belong. This was not my home, and this was no longer my life.  I rode with my sister on the long drive home. I told her stories about my friends and the places we loved, I told her stories about everything I could remember. I told her stories hoping Id never forget the small things that made me love that part of my life. I arrived back at home with my family, filing my boxes away in the attic like lost treasure.  I still have boxes from that move. Even though Ive lived in two other homes, Ive never sorted through them all. They are rife with memories, rife with tears and sweet kisses long gone.  Years later, Im still unpacking boxes, sifting out my past and my present on the basement floor in front of me, spread out like a flea market. And I look in amazement wondering how I endured, wondering how it all shaped me, wondering if any of it matters at all...but I think I know the answer.   I look at these bits of me, taking inventory of my past, and of our recent lives together...relishing every moment. Until it's just me and the remnants of difficult, brave decisions scattered among the boxes...and jumbled memories...and the dust...  I walk up the stairs, shut off the basement light, and leave it all behind once more.

        garons endommags (damaged boys)      thirteen     the nutcracker       Coreys rendezvous with Patrice had added an unexpected and unique sexual energy to the routine of rehearsals. Every command uttered by Patrice seemed exciting, stimulating and playful. His energy was dark, immense and demanding. Corey could feel his dark eyes piercing him, surveying every move, every pause. Company class was suddenly more interesting, even for the other dancersother dancers who did not know Coreys secret, but sensed it. Most of the dancers, even Patrice, had performed  The Nutcracker  countless times. Most had performed it since the beginning of their careers, once a season. For the ballet world, it was the one staple that guaranteed a little financial freedom to do other, more gutsy and artistic work. This was the workhorse of all American and European classical ballet companies. Corey hated it. Hated it vehemently.  The Nutcracker , to him, represented the worst in the holiday season: lack of personal freedom. He felt indentured to the company. He felt like a slaveperforming this sad, tired old tradition day after day from Thanksgiving to New Years. Even though the audiences loved it, they never stuck around to see the real artistry, the season after  The Nutcracker , or The Nutbuster as many dancers referred to it. No, there were far fewer audiences who stayed to see  Gaite Parisienne  or even de Milles legendary  Rodeo . These were the important pieces, the historic and preserved choreography like a Rodin sculpture or a Manet.    Patrice watched the corps like a raptor stalking his prey. He watched for any flaw, misstep or slight imperfection, and corrected it with a sweeping and authoritative bellow across the rehearsal studio. He was born in Lyon, France, and came to the United States as a teenager, dancing with New York City Ballet, and attending school on an international scholarship for male dancers. Hed endured years at boarding schools and various dance academies. After his parents sent him away to study in London, hed had his first encounter with another young male dancer. Hed loved Colins grace and charm, two things he thought he lacked. The other students were not inclined to speak to Patrice or invite him along on social occasions, but everyone recognized his extraordinary talents in the rehearsal studios. He was flawless and breathtaking, and the dance meant everything to himit was his life.     Colin was the gregarious student among the class. His tousled hair and winning smile made him a favorite with all of the students, male and female. The instructors, however, found Colin a bit trying. After all, it was a prestigious academy of ballet, and not a social dance hall. Colin preferred the new and explosive rock music to the structure of classical. He was one of the most athletic dancers in the academy, having incredible strength and power. He could leap a vertical two metres from a dead-still position and complete three revolutions on the way back down. He thought, perhaps, he might be more suited for basketball.     Patrice like to be around Colin. Through Colin, he could be involved with the others, and over time, became amiable, but no friendships could blossom or survive Patrices dark and distanced nature. There was room only for the dance, and for Colin.    Colin loved Patrices serious nature, his focus and his dancing. He also loved his body, shorter and taut and spring-loaded. There seemed no end to his grace and agility, and that more than compensated for his rather average face. But, in dance, the courtship is silent. The muscles speak, the extremities speak, but rarely the mouth. Patrice was moody and complicated and Colin was exactly opposite.    "Plie, pliegood, good, goodGabrielle, head upup! Christopher, we are not dancing about as if atop a surfboard. Strength, give me solid movements, tighter circlestighter, tighter!"     Corey smirked, remembering quite a different conversation in Patrices bed. When rehearsal concluded, Patrice motioned for Corey. "Corey, you were not focused at all today. I think you may need some additional instruction. Ive called your service to inform them Ill be expecting you later. Don't be late."

        garons endommags (damaged boys)       twelve      someday well know        Marcus, circa 1994. Hed graduated in the top fifth percentile of the class, beating out almost all the well-established Southern legacy students with names like Thurman, Burwell, Lee and Marshall. Hed managed to navigate the treacherous maze of academia and politics without even outing himself. In the South, even on a college campus, being gay was not anything to wave a flag aboutor have a parade. Or even say out loud. No, Marcus has managed to survive four brutal years, four incredibly challenging and stimulating years at the nations oldest institution of higher learning. It was a major feat that hed survived, the College of William and Mary had the highest rate of student suicide anywhere in the world. Hed arrived at William and Mary by way of his academic prowess, charm and athletic ability. Marcus received a full academic and athletic scholarship for four years. Maybe hed have done well to join his classmates in the political arena in Washington, or in New York. He had classmates in the international arenas, too. Michael Marchaud worked for the French Embassy in New York. Hed  used his excellent grades and a few family connections to land his tony employment with Ambassador Chartres in Manhattan. Although he would have preferred a placement in Europe or Asia, he was thrilled to be in the capital city of the western hemisphere. New York also allowed him to be in the same country as Marcus, and close to key influencers in the world of international politics.    Marcus was not interested at all in becoming or being a key influencer, he never had been. But, here, in his life in pharmaceutical sales, hed become just that, the central figure in his office and certainly within his various social circles. Everyone always wanted to know what he was doing, what he thought of everything and anything, and wanted to be around him just because he was Marcus. It all seemed exceedingly silly to him, although he remembered growing up, the sixth grade in particular, when he would never have imagined any modicum of personal popularity. He was not liked. He was scrawny and uncomfortable in his own skin. The other boys could smell his weakness and often taunted him, threatened him. So, this sudden adoration as an adult seemed odd and fleeting. Hed not been interested in what others thought, and he thought it foolish that people were interested in his. Nonetheless, he understood the circumstances, he understood the implied responsibility.     Michael was in his World Politics course during their sophomore year. Hed noticed him in class, but the two actually met during a jog through the historic district in Colonial Williamsburg. Michael had just completed a two mile jaunt and was starting his cool-down near Merchants Square when he saw Marcus run from the Wren Building on campus toward Duke of Gloucester Street. It was exactly three quarters of a mile to the Capitol at the opposite end of the street, so Michael followed, unnoticed at first. By the time Marcus reached Bruton Parish, Michael had cinched the distance between them and said hello. Marcus nodded, but said nothing until hed completed five miles, Michael trailing all the while. Marcus broke the silence.     "You kept up for five miles. Not bad!"   "Seven."   "That was five."   "Ah yes, but I had completed two miles before joining you. But you make a very attractive incentive to keep running."     Marcus smiled, and for once, he welcomed the attention. It marked the beginning of an incredible four years between them. Before the other men, before it was complicated by distance and ambiguitybefore things got deadly.

        garons endommags (damaged boys)       eleven      cold december flies away...     Daniel could not stop kissing him. For as much as he tried, he could not control what burned inside him...a long, hateful volcano of madness, destruction and passion...welling up within him until there was no other option. He'd seen the kid in and out of Braden's condo recently, just one in a line of many over the past few months. They's never seemed real, before...not human, certainly. And yet, here he was with his tongue in its mouth. It was both repulsive and thrilling.    Kyle heard of these types before, the men who hide and hate and beat themselves up...beat up other people, too. There was the certain thrill of being desired, of being wanted by someone he considered his superior. This man, neighbor of asshole Braden, was smart looking, successful and drove a nice car. Nicer than anything he'd seen growing up in the west side neighborhoods where the only car interior people saw was that of a police cruiser. Kyle liked the forcefulness of it...he'd been trown out by Braden, and thrown up against the garage door by Daniel...all within a matter of minutes. He like Daniel's firey nature, as if it was all bottled-up inside him and exploding. He decided he'd like to make Daniel explode...after all, attention was attention, and it gave him a reason to be seen by Braden, if he could make this work.    Daniel lessened his grip on Kyle, kissed him deeply, more pensively and with meaning. He pressed his body full against Kyle's slight frame, wanting him to feel the hardness. Kyle groped, and Daniel pulled away.   "What?!"  "I don't want to do this out here. Come on."  Daniel motioned for Kyle to get into the car.   "We'll go somewhere."  "I don't have any money, so I can't pay or anything."  "Don't worry. Just get in."  They both slipped into the car and Daniel eased out of the drive and onto the boulevard. His hand reached over and squeezed Kyle's thigh.   Jeanine thought it odd that Daniel wasn't at home when she returned from the office. He usually beat her by half an hour, and was almost never late. She checked the voicemail and found a message...he'd be home a little later than usual...meeting went longer than expected, but he'd already had dinner. She went to the refrigerator and pulled out a Yoplait. The strawberry-banana was her favorite. She sat at the kitchen counter leafing through this month's  Cosmo  and hating how she looked. On every page was a woman of perfect beauty, gorgeous coloring, great hair and flawless physique. She contrasted that image to every degree. Even in her snappy business attire she was still rather plain, uninteresting and unextraordinary to the eye. But Daniel loved her for what was inside, he'd said it so many times, she almost believed it. She felt acceptable, normal and even a bit sexy with him. She tossed the empty yogurt container into the garbage and switched off the kitchen light. She padded quietly down the hallway to the den, flopped into an overstuffed chair and flicked on  Wheel of Fortune .    The clerk looked at Daniel as he registered for the room. He could see outside, and even through the pouring rain...he could see Kyle in the front seat...waiting. The motel was in a sketchy, run-down section of the city. The kind of place no one likes to drive through. The kind of place that feels abandoned...a place that delivered anonymity. Daniel keyed into the room and once Kyle entered, he quickly locked the door. There were no formalities...in the darkness, warm, hungry mounths found each other. Daniel pushed Kyle to the bed...wanting more...   As Daniel fucked Kyle in a seedy motel near the interstate, Jeanine solved the puzzle before Vanna had turned more than four letters :  Caligula .

       Let's see...lots of little stuff going on. First off, my housemate and soul-sister for the past four years (Kelly) bought a house and will be moving at the end of December. So, I have a lot of mixed feelings...I am really excited for her, but I'm going to miss having her around. There's nothing better than having a great housemate or roommate. So, I look toward January and being alone for the first time in four years. I'm sure there are may things I'll really love about it, but it's hard to see from this vantage point.   Getting ready for the holidays always seems so laborious, so this year, I'm taking time off from work and I'm going to have fun instead of rushing around. I'm planning to deck my halls on Friday. Phil and I have decided to take a road trip up to Toronto for New Years. We'll be staying downtown and partying for 3 days...which should be fun. However, I'll come home to an empty house....don't get me started. So, I'm thinking about having a mid-January party...something to look forward to after the holidays have passed. Will you come? You are invited...Anyone who bothers to read this is graciously invited. Just drop me an email and I'll send you the details when I have 'em.   While I was visiting Williamsburg (I'll post photos soon) with Trish, my dog Toby developed some wanderlust and ended up being picked-up by a nice couple over in Cleveland Heights. As it turns out, he'd only wandered about a block and a half away, still...my friend Margaret (the dogsitter) felt awful. But, Toby's like his dad and loves to check stuff out!! He's home safe and warm now after an afternoon in a household with 2 gregarious golden retrievers. He hates well-groomed, pretty dogs...they pull focus from him. He hates being upstaged...just like his dad.

       All in all, a very nice weekend. I had my Christmas madrigal concerts on Friday and Saturday evenings (both went well) and Kelly and I had Steve as a house guest this weekend while he recovered (flawlessly I should say) from oral surgery. I worked for a few hours yesterday and caught a few minutes of the Radio City show and Act II of A Christmas Carol. Both look great!! Anyhow, sorry for the lack of writing, but it's been nice taking a few days off...just like last week. Anyhow, I'll get back on the stick soon enough...

        garons endommags (damaged boys)     ten - blue moon     He thought it was just an old saying,  once in a blue moon . But there it was, high above him, peeking down over his shoulder and illuminating the path in front of him. He'd read the definition...a second full moon in one month...very rare indeed. Thus the saying. He walked on the gravel walk, crunching each step...an intoxicating rhythm swirling like southern jasmine after an evening rainstorm. The sound was predictable. It made sense. It was orderly and clean. And Braden liked things that way.    He'd agreed to the vacation months ago, never expecting it to come to fruition. It was a hasty agreement realized suddenly with the arrival of an airline ticket overnight expressed to his office the week earlier. His best friend Marieke was also organized and orderly...so much so that she'd actually planned this vacation over a year earlier, and had planned to take no one other than Braden. And when it came to Marieke, there would be no arguing. There would be no last minute delays, cancellations or rescheduling. He'd even managed to arrange his time off accordingly.     He found himself in Charleston, South Carolina, strolling along the historic boulevards watching tourists, locals and anyone pleasing to his eye. He'd managed to walk alone that evening, Marieke otherwise engaged with a fine young gentleman from Maryland. He thought his name might be Joshua...but he'd not paid close attention. He'd been watching someone else completely. Marieke was introduced to Joshua on the veranda of the hotel, just after the evening cocktails were cleared and guests were ushered into dinner. Joshua was a high school history teacher and soccer coach. At age twenty-nine, he radiated youth and vitality, but was too old for Braden's taste. With the subtle glance rendered between best friends, Braden departed to find his own mischief. At this point she was probably planning on fucking him...and good for her...or maybe better for him. He'd heard stories of Marieke's sexual prowess...and not from Marieke.     Walking along the path from the hotel grounds down to the harbor, he relaxed for the first time in over a year. Pressure leapt from his shoulders and he was dizzy from relief. It was also, effectively, the first time he was really single...not dating anyone and with no intention of doing so. Things were always messy in that arena. Better to be single for awhile and figure things out. He sat on a bench facing Charleston Harbor and looked out toward the dark horizon, barely detectable...a line of blackness where the stars dissolved into the sea. Braden watched as small boats passed, headed to their slips in yacht clubs and private docks. All the people with money, he thought...and did it guarantee them happiness? Well, yes...to a degree it certainly did. Problems are problems no matter what the bank balance is...but perspective is everything, and problems look decidedly different from the bow of a yacht.     Braden wandered to the slips located at the edge of the park a few feet from the hotel grounds. There was little activity, except from a smaller boat near the end of the dock. He heard music as he approached...something familiar and moody. As he approached, someone moved topside to secure one of the lines. He saw the flicker of a lighter and the brief illumination of the most beautiful face he'd ever seen. Chiseled and tan with beautiful lips and high cheekbones, he'd accounted and taken inventory of this face in a single instant. His eyebrows were sandy brown, with sunbleached blonde hair tousled by the wind...Braden thought he was looking at an advertisement for youth and beauty and the high life. He was classic, handsome and boyish. Maybe he'd seen him in a magazine...one with matte pages and pungent colognes. He'd stopped breathing for fear of being discovered. It was too late.   "It's not polite for strangers to sneak about like that."  Braden stammered, "I'm...I'm sorry...I didn't mean..."  "You won't be a stranger if you introduce yourself then, will you?"  "Braden Mackey."  "Never met a Braden before. I'm Thomas."

        garons endommags (damaged boys)     part nine - Goodbye, Baltimore   There were five of them in the rowhouses across the street. Underneath the sheen of public normalcy and personal splendour lives the gaping damage within.     Ben hated saying goodbye. Forever it seemed. From the time he was twelve and Robbie left for Omaha, he'd learned to hate goodbyes, learned to hate the ebb and flow of people in and out of his life. Of course, there was no remedy. The more people he accumulated as friends and lovers, the more he said the word, two wrenching syllables that changed lives, the more he hated the final glance backwards, over the shoulder...the fading steps away. For Ben, there was nothing after goodbye. It just all seemed to shut down. There had been promises of calls, letters and emails, but one by one, relationships faded into leaves of paper...cards at birthdays and holidays, returned and sometimes not. He lost track of the loosing track. How many people was it now? Fifty? Sixty maybe? And what did it matter? He loved all of the friends and lovers...some more than others, and he could find any one of them with relative ease. And just what was it that stopped him? Maybe it was easier to say goodbye once. Yes, goodbye once was better...he was sure of it. He learned this from Adam. He learned it again and again with Adam. With Adam, there was always another goodbye. It's just the way it was.   Ben met Adam the second semester at State, when they were enrolled in the same Biology class...a freshman requirement. Ben spotted Adam as soon as he'd walked into the lecture. At only 5' 6" he might have been easily overlooked, but Ben loved his infectious smile and his short, dark hair. He radiated energy. People gravitated toward him. People wanted to be around him. The women in class flirted and giggled and shot coy glances. Adam caught them sometimes, just smiling and shrugging. During a lab experiment he sat next to Ben.  "I don't know why they do that. It's so embarrassing...I mean, I'm gay, so I really don't care...but I'm sure they'd feel foolish. What do you think? Hi, I'm Adam...I should have said that first."   Ben and Adam dated, fell madly in love and spent the better part of four years together. They'd vacationed together, loved and were loved by each other's families and came to know the intimacy and abundance of true love. There would never be a relationship more impactful, and Ben knew it, knew it deep down inside. At the end, there was an excruciating goodbye. A decision to part ways, pursue lives in different cities, lives with other people. Lives with replacements. It was like the taking of a limb, the searing amputation of a life and love. It all seemed impossible and horrific. There were no breaches of trust, no trespasses with others. In the end, it was just a simple decision to try something new.    Over the following six months, Ben and Adam lived in separate cities...negotiating their ending, apart. Ben flew to Baltimore three times...always looking for a way to repair, restart...to fix the confusing heap of emotions. He'd grown to love and hate Baltimore. It represented the end of the happiest part of his life...at least the small life he'd lived at the age of twenty-three. He hated Baltimore because Adam wanted to be in Baltimore more than he wanted to be with Ben, and that hurt the worst. But, he'd loved Baltimore for the change, for the mere fact that it was different...because it represented intoxicating opportunity. He'd hated that, too. His visits to Baltimore were always electric...emotionally and sexually charged. There were no rules, Adam and Ben behaved as if they were still dating...long talks, sex, dinners and evenings out. It was subterranean emotional chaos. Inside, Ben wanted to cry and scream and hold Adam forever. Outside, he smiled and relished his fleeting time...his weekend reprieve from singledom and his hated new life. At night, they'd fall asleep entwined like they always had...holding each other closely...drifting into a warm, lovely sleep together.    The third visit was the same. There was no difference at all. But something had changed inside Ben, something subtle and quiet. He kissed Adam full on the lips, said "I love you" one last time before heading down the jetway at gate D-12. He was halfway down when he realized he would never come back here...not for Adam. There would be no more fantasizing, no more romantic ideas of a reunion. There would be no more quick weekend trips to Baltimore...it was finished.   The 737 taxied onto the runway, and bolted down the length of concrete before leaping into the sky...banking north, away from Baltimore...away from the city of disappointment...away from his profound sadness. Tears welled in his eyes. And as the gentle hills of Glen Burnie, Maryland, faded beneath him...he said it.   "Goodbye, Baltimore... goodbye ."

         update from the pain management center...     My conservation of movement today seems to have paid off. I'm feeling so much better...it is definitely a marked improvement from last evening. I'm slowly weening myself off of the Advil...I've now switched to grain alcohol. Cheers!

       So, last night, I was all zoned out...a natural response to searing chronic pain, I suppose, and I couldn't think of anything else. However, after a good night's rest, I feel a little more human. I still have pain, but I'm hoping the Advil does the trick (heh-heh, I said "trick"). Sorry for all the whining and haiku.

         a purple haze...      I took some muscle relaxers last night to help ease the pain in my lower back (due to excess Scarecrowing). So, today, I woke in an absolute haze, feeling all floaty-like and slow. It seemed to help me sleep, but my back is still feeling sore. I hope it disspates by tomorrow...

         A letter from late January...      Hello Deidra!    Can you forgive me for taking so long to write a freaking email?! Sorry to have been MIA for so long, but things have been a little wacky. In December, my housemate of 4 years bought her own house, so the entire month was spent packing, reorganizing, cleaning and moving her out. This was an enormous task, but more than that, emotionally very difficult. Kelly was sort of my platonic significant other...someone who knew me on a daily basis better than even my own family. Losing her was a huge blow, but good for us both, in the end. I was devastated to lose her, but so proud of her & happy that she had such a wonderful opportunity to go make a home of her own.     So, it forced me to really reorganize my own life and prepare for a new phase, one that has me managing the household by myself...which isn't so bad after all. Kelly and I speak almost daily and get together every week to catch up. So, it's all very strange and wonderful at the same time...making my own house feel new all over again.     So, then it was early January and I began WIZARD OF OZ rehearsals full-tilt with Jill and Phil, plus handling the tours of STOMP and BEST LITTLE WHOREHOUSE. So, I've been way out of touch, to say the least...and I apologize. I have also been cast as Jesus in JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR...and have been having flashbacks to the time I met you...and those are, indeed, happy memories for me.     I guess I could summarize my feelings as conflicted lately...bouncing between feeling sorry for myself and elated, if that makes any sense at all. In any case, that's what's been going on with me and I really do want to catch up with you soon. I love you and miss you and hope to talk to you in short order. Please give my love to Mark...    Much love,  Todd

        garons endommags (damaged boys)      nineteen     a stranger in the house     He was driving in the dark. There was nowhere else to go but here, into the dark, into the unknown. Corey hated surprises, especially in his new career. Hed been hired to make an appearance way out east, in Claydon, beyond the county line, beyond the sensibilities of anyone mildly urbane. The drive had reached almost forty minutes as he pulled onto Route 44 somewhere in the middle of Crestwood County, somewhere literally in the middle of the dark. There were no streetlights and not even reflector plates running down the centerline. Corey watched the road ahead with intensity, almost the same intensity of learning new choreography or learning the movements of his johns.      Patrice had warned him about indiscriminate hook-ups and unfamiliar men, warned him about the intoxication of fast men and fast money. And he reminded him, above all else, there is the dance. In his own way, Patrice showed the strength, concern and the nurturing Corey wanted, wanted from his own father. But Corey also wanted the intense sexuality, the exquisite physicality of Patrices touch, the animal thrill of succumbing completely to desire.     But, that was somewhere else for now. Now, he had to find the next client, located out in this puddle of blackness, this rural nowhereland. Surrounded by quiet farms and cows and other livestock he couldnt see, he imagined his life in a different context. There were friends and family, lots of family, hed always wanted lots of siblings, and there was somehow a simpler life. There was support and love and laughter. Not the rigid, impenetrable and shallow parents, the insufferable sister and fucking Jesus. It was the church that really got in the waydestroyed what little hope he had of a normal family. Especially now. Especially with their gay, ballet dancer son. Their gay, ballet dancing whore of a son who felt like a stranger in the house. The elephant in the room that no one acknowledges. And wouldnt it just be enough to deliver an unrecoverable blow to both his parents? Maybe an aneurysm. Maybe a stroke or maybe even heart failure. No, not heart failure. Impossible when one has no heart.     And there it was. Hed wished both of his parents dead, or comatose. If hed have believed in a god, he was sure hed have been struck down on the spot. But, Corey believed only in the tangible, in the things he could actually see and touch. He believed in sex as religion, and he worshipped often. And it was Good.      Corey arrived at the address quickly scrawled on an old electric bill. Hed grabbed it as he retrieved his messages from the service. Lou. 8462 Fowlers Mill. The house was enormous. Larger than anything hed imagined for someplace like this, way out in the middle of nowhere. Its outlined loomed large against the night sky. There was only a faint glow coming from a few windows on the first floor.     He stepped up onto the front porch which stretched the length of the house, and wrapped around the corner. He rang the doorbell, which chimed from someplace deep within the house. It was a good 45 seconds before he heard approaching footsteps. When the door swung open, heavy on its own hinges, it revealed a man, no more than 43, towering above him. He was a commanding presence but said very little. He motioned for Corey to follow him inside. The interior was almost all wood, the floors and the walls. He set down his overnight bagwhat he had begun calling his ho bag.      Just show me where you want me to dance for you.     No dancing.     But, you realize, youre paying me to dance for you, right? Thats what youre paying me to do.     I understand. No dancing, even though thats what Im paying for. I want you to follow me upstairs.     Corey followed him to the second floor and down a long, dark hallway to the master bedroom. Beyond grotesque oil paintings and flickering nightlights near the baseboard. But, in front of him was this man, Lou, tall and quiet and sexy. He was of solid build, few words and intense. Corey guessed ex-military. He had short-cropped hair and a permanent five oclock shadow. He was rugged and masculine and decisive. Corey was a stranger here, and he felt it with every step.     Here. Lou pointed to the bed. This is where I want you to perform. With that, he removed his clothes and revealed a physique that rivaled Coreys.     Lets see what you can do.      And Corey went to work, remembering nothing, noting no details and closing himself off from the horror of his own making. He felt as if he was outside of himself looking back at someone he didnt recognize. Seeing a whore and a liar and a failure.      Seeing the stranger hed become.

It's been almost two weeks since any substantial posting and I was starting to get crabby.    While I'm on the soapbox, I'd just like to remind everyone that we all write weblogs for very different reasons. Weblogs are an expression of each individual...so, if you think they're all supposed to be a certain way...you can park it elsewhere, Mary...   My friend  urlLink Rachel   just started her weblog recently...so please check her out...she's sexy, sassy and smart...plus there's fat kittens on her site.

        damaged boys     eighteen     towson     Maybe it wasnt the best idea hed ever had, but it was something he felt he needed to do, and this, quite honestly, was his best opportunity.     It had been nearly a year since hed seen Adam, a year since hed set foot in Baltimore. The fact is, and few people ever knew, Ben did go back. Once.     He remembered the constant partying of the holiday seasonfrom Thanksgiving through the New Year, Ben had been invited to no fewer than twelve parties, and he planned on going to every last one of them. Now in his final year at university, he was immersed in his senior thesis and completing his required coursework. There was little time to come home and visit with friends and family. This three-week respite in his studies was a welcome break from the tedium of his college routine. Although, hed remembered when it was all fun and new and even the smallest thing was exciting. Eventually, these things wear off, and they become uninteresting and, once again, unextraordinary.     But visiting home afforded a wonderful opportunity to meet new people and catch-up with old friends and acquaintances. He arrived at Phillips a few minutes before the party was scheduled to begin. They worked in tandem, readying the house for guestsspending some treasured time alonebefore the impending circus. Phillip liked to mix large numbers of his friends from wildly different circles, so his events were always interesting.    Aaron was a dental student from Toronto, visiting several teaching hospitals in the area where he might wish to continue his studies. Hed been introduced to Phillip through mutual friends, and promptly invited to the party.     There was always an air of expectation at holiday gatheringsthe mystery of strangers and the sense of possibility. Aaron was the most gregarious of all the new people; the fresh faces with stories unknown. Ben found himself immediately attracted to his energy, silly and erratic. Short and shiny, with an impish grin, Aaron had charmed half the room within the first five minutes.    Later, during a raucous game of Truth or Dare, Aaron was dared to kiss someone in the roomand hed singled-out Ben. He marched directly across the living room and planted the most delicious kiss on Bens lips. It was playful and sweet and reminded him immediately of Adam.     Aaron was a totally different animalhe was Canadian. Most remarkably, he was a good twelve inches shorter than Ben and had a generally agreeable demeanor. There were no stormy mood swings or bitter debates. There, of course, was not the love, either.  But, Aaron would dofor now. It was that excitement that surrounds the newness of it allthe kisses, the wordsthe discovery about the other person.     Aaron stayed for three days before returning to Tufts in Boston, but not before making plans to spend a weekend together in Baltimore. Baltimore. Besides the obvious pathos, it was an easy flight from both cities, with low fares. Ben told himself this was why they needed to meet in Baltimore.  And hed believed it. That is, until he landed at Baltimore Washington International, before he commenced a sustained series of flashbacks, returning him to a city rife with pain and sex and the last bits of his broken heart.    How odd, he thought, to be here with absolutely no intention of seeing Adamwithout Adam even knowing he was there.     Aaron and Ben stayed at a hotel in Towson, just outside the city. Towson was a familiar placea place Ben had frequented on each of his trips. Ben took Aaron to the Japanese restaurant where he and Adam shared their last meal. They walked and Aaron talked. Ben disintegrated into past conversations, keeping his eyes open for glimpses of Adam, for glimpses of what once wasfor glimpses of anything he could hold onto.     When Aaron and Ben made love, Ben imagined Adamsomewhere in the same city making love to someone else. Someone other than Ben.    As Ben kissed Aaron goodbye, he apologized silently. Apologized for not really being there. For not showing up, for being collapsed to completely into the shadows of his former life. But, it would be silly to try and explain all of this to Aaron.    Aaron flew back to Boston and Ben flew homeboth with very different memories of the same weekend. Both with hopes for each other, and both with an endless, hollow loneliness.

        garons endommags (damaged boys)      seventeen     fade into you     It was like that song by Mazzy Starthat one that went fade into you . He kept hearing it over and over in his head. The fact was, he couldnt stop thinking about Michael, and daydreaming was deadly at the College of William and Mary. Hed managed to glide through his World Politics exam, but hed not be so lucky in Organic Chemistry. Marcus decided to keep all thoughts of Michael strictly out of bounds during his prescribed study periods. Otherwise, hed failplain and simple. But, he felt oddly complete with himsomething hed never felt beforealways opting to be alone, single rather than depend on someone else for happiness or love or sex or all three. But, Michael was different in every way.    Michael joined him frequently on his jogs through town, and grew to enjoy his silent company. Michael was indeed an eyeful, his dark hair and eyes set off his athletic frame, and his movement more fluid and graceful than many world-class long distance runners. There was also something else that set him apart, a kind of darkness or aloofness that made him seem almost mysterious, intriguing. Of course, Marcus thought, it might have been his European upbringingalways keeping respectful distance. Not wanting you to get too close, ever.     Whatever the case was, Marcus adored Michael. He loved not only his looks, but his intelligence and good nature. Michael was an affable companion, friend and excellent lover. They were compatible completelyin ways that allowed them to have entire conversations without speaking a word. Marcus hated their semester breaks, and even more, summerwhen Michael would return home to his family in France.     Marcus was fascinated by what he called European sensibilityMichaels family made no issue whatsoever about his sexuality, and made it see if it was the most obvious and normal outcome. This was, of course, completely different from what Marcus experienced with his family. His parents glazed over like they were hearing a fatal diagnosis, or realized theyd just lost the hand of Bridge at the country club. It seemed to Marcus that his parents were more irritated than anything else. It was a reality they had never considered for their son, or for their family. At once, his parents retreated into the closetthe one left conveniently empty by Marcus. But, after a few months, the family began speaking about itmaking the requisite inquiries about safety and something about "have you found any special friends lately." After an entire year had passed and all those concerned had realized this was not a passing fancy, more direct questions were plied, jokes were dispensed and the family settled in with the information that their genius jock son was queer. His father, George, was always curious to know when they would get to meet any of Marcus friends, and were they any good at golf and tennis?     Michael would more than fit the bill. His gentile nature and impeccable manners would charm both of his parents, not to mention their friends at the club. Michael was an avid golfer, and worthy foe on the tennis court. He bonded immediately with George, and they spend much of their time together competing.     There was, of course, Michaels enviable pedigreefrom one of the most prominent families in France, and perhaps Western Europe. If George was going to have a gay son, by god, he was going to date within the right circles. And, in this way, George began to see very little difference in the lives of his straight children, and in the life of Marcus.     To Marcus, life became real and surrealnormal in the strangest of ways. And, he was happy, actually happy for maybe the first time ever in his life. Like an accident, or a miracleor both, hed found Michael.

        garons endommags (damaged boys)      sixteen     you only get what you give       Jeanine was furious, Daniel arriving home shortly after nine that evening. Where the hell had he been and why hadnt he the courtesy to call? These were the two questions thrust at him with rapid-fire repetition until he could do nothing else but lie. Lie hard and fast to get her to shut up. At least for now.    "Jennings asked me to sit in on a board meeting with the Chairman, and I couldnt very well say no. Im sorry for not calling. I didnt mean for you to worry."    With that lie confidently presented and accepted, she quieted. But, the chaos inside Daniel was nowhere near quiet. Hed just spent the past three hours prostituting his own morality with a young twenty-something gayboy. Home seemed different, Jeanine looked different, and it was if everyone could tell hed been with Kyle. Concious of this, he did everything in his power to control his body language, to smooth over the rough edgesto throw any suspicious minds off course, to allay fears. To erase any emotional and psychological evidence.     He was sure he still smelled of sex, sweaty, masculine sex that Jeanine was sure to decipher. He jumped into the shower at home and turned the water up as hot as he could take itscrubbing himself of the sweat, the dirt and the sin. Hed showered at the motel before dropping Kyle off at the bus stop, but he didnt feel clean enoughno soap was strong enough to cleanse him.     And, as much as he tried to erase every thought and memory, he couldnt help but to slip back into the bliss of holding Kylethe passion and the sheer animalism of their time together. It all seemed so illicit and dangerous, and Daniel supposed that it was both. And it was more exciting and interesting than sleeping with Jeanine. Jeanine, who just wanted to be with Daniel so she wasnt alone. This was different than all of that, different enough to make him want more. Once again, the guilt crept back and Daniel broke down into tears. What had he done? What filthy, horrible trespass had he committed? He turned the shower dial all the way to "Hot" and the scalding water burned his skin.     Daniel toweled dry and walked into the bedroom. Jeanine was undressed and waiting. He kissed her passionately, the way hed learned from Kyle. His passion and guilt rose up from within, intoxicating him, rendering him powerless against it. He held Jeanine down, kissing her, fondling her and finally forcing himself inside her. The passion seemed to erase away the remnants of Kyle and the seedy motel. For Jeanine, it was a reassurance that Daniel did, in fact, still love her...that he still found her attractive...even when she didn't herself. And so, they continued togetherin consensual denial.     Kyle boarded the 82 westbound bus just shortly after nine. He was exhaustedand desired. He could still feel Daniel, and relished the sensation as he found a seat on the half-empty bus. His mind drifted to thoughts of the motel and Daniels slender, hairless body next to his. He remembered Bradens harsh words and being dismissedright into the waiting arms of his neighbor. Kyle laughed a little thinking how surprised Braden would be to find out Daniel liked to fuck boys, toobut probably not as surprised as Daniels wife would be if she ever found out    "Hey faggot."     Kyle looked behind him. Three thuggish looking guys were sitting in the seats behind and to the side of him.    "Im talking to you, faggot."    "Leave me alone."     "Oh, okaycocksucker." They continued to snicker and Kyle could think of nothing else but to get off the bus. He pushed the stop request button, and moved toward the front of the bus.    When he exited, he walked quickly from the bus stop. He didnt notice the others follow him.     "Wait up, cocksucker."    Kyle felt sick to his stomach. He turned and faced the three men from the bus.     "What do you want from me?"     "I want you to suck my dick, fag."     Kyle didnt feel the glass bottle smash against his head inasmuch as he heard the glass shatter. He heard the cackle of his assailants as they kicked him to the ground, cracking ribs and chipping his teeth on the pavement. He was paralyzed with pain, with fear and shock. He could feel the wet warmth as they urinated on him before running off into the urban shadows.     Kyle could feel the coldness setting in, the numb visitor creeping throughout his body, until there was nothing but distorted, tinny sounds coming from the street. He never heard the footsteps, nor the hurried banter of the passersby who found the crumpled heap of human being near the garbage cansthe strangers that stopped to help, who called paramedicswho saved his life by just a few minutes spare.

       Too bad my recent urges to Blog have been thwarted by the broke-down tech at Blogger. Anyhow, the past few days have been interesting and amazing. I spent Tuesday doing a press junket with Ann-Margret and Gary Sandy, both starring in the current national tour of Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. Both of them have been terrific to work with, and are wonderful in the show. I've been knee-deep in Munchkins this week...what with OZ rehearsals in high gear. In any case, I expect to be back blogging in short order.

        reluctant saviour    I was offered, and I accepted, the role of  Jesus  in Andrew Lloyd Webber's  Jesus Christ Superstar , slated to hit the Cleveland stage in March. It's funny to me, partly because I'm not particularly religious, and partly because my first legit show was  JCS  back in 1988...when I played Peter. That show was responsible for some of my most significant friendships to date. I met Phil and Deidra and many other who have remained in my life since then. So, here I am all these years later, set to play the title role...a role I never imagined would be mine. What I love about the show is the incredibly raw score...it screeches and rumbles, it bellows and jams...nothing else sounds quite like it. And yet, it is a demanding and taxing show on everyone...the kind of show I love best as a performer. I'll be sure to post details as I get them, and of course, notes from along the way...

        from the boy who lives here...     Winter finally arrived today with the first bona fide snowstorm. It was not legendary in size or scope, but it was beautiful...especially since I haven't seen much snow at all. Except for Weather Channel shots of Buffalo. I conjured thoughts of skiing...snapping by boots into the bindings of my Elan skis and hitting the slopes. One of the things I love about skiing is the absolute serenity of it. Outside of the ride up the mountain on the lift, it's a relatively solitary sport. This is definitely something I have to look forward to...    I laugh remembering learning to ski. I might not have ever left the bunny hills without the cajoling of my seventh-grade best friend Charles Kaake...who always pushed me to do more, better and go further. I wonder what ever happened to him. I know he moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana. After that, who knows.     I spent today with Kelly, doing some after Xmas gift certificate shopping. We hit Borders, Bed Bath & Beyond, Gap and the grocery store. It was fun just being together...doing regular stuff. It was our first outing together since she moved, and it was heartening to know that it's still just as fabulous spending time spending money.     Bring the pain...     I'm sorry guys, but I'm going to have to refuse your offers of courtship. The Todd is taking a dating hiatus. It's so funny, because when it rains...well, you know. Here in Cleveland, things can look a little bleak on the dating landscape. However, as is always the case, as soon as I declare "hiatus" boys come scrambling out of the woodwork trying to woo me. Where ya been, boys? Well, I appreciate the attention and effort, guys...but I'm gonna stick to my guns. Not that y'all aren't handsome and adorable and smart and sexy... (timing is everything)     Next...

        garons endommags (damaged boys)       fifteen      shoot the boulevard     Braden returned from Charleston with a mild sunburn and a quiet understanding about love. For once, it finally made sense. His brief encounter with Thomas made him think differently and feel differently. It was nothing like the endless parade of twinks and club boys in and out of his condo. Hed thought love was sentimental and ridiculous and unattainable. But, then there was Thomas, perfect and lovely in every way.     Braden was home, but part of him remained in Charlestonalong the lush green avenues and strident blue-gray harbor. Thomas had surprised him. He was drawn to his silky Southern charms and his impeccably white teeth. He liked the way he tasted when they kissed. His lips like gorgeous fruit, perfect and sweet.     Braden drove along the boulevard through the trendy neighborhood full of gay boys and purebred dogs and Glam-rock boutiques. Here, there was no class. Just daily living. Probably exotic and progressive to those dim rural fags who got excited at the sight of an Olive Garden. But, to Braden, he might have just as well passed it by. Hed traveled the boulevard at least once every day for the past six years, since moving into the city and starting his new life, since Alan died.     No, he wasnt going to allow that memory here. Nohe would think only of Thomas now. There would be no thoughts of dead lovers and suicide and drugs. That was too messy. Death left a traila horrible, disgusting, sickening trail of loose ends and scraps. That was Alan. That was a mess hed long ago reorganized, and filed far, far away. No, Thomas was clean and neat and tanned. He wore crisp clothes in the colors of clay and azure and russet. He flossed. He could fit neatly into Bradens life if only he wasnt 1500 miles away, or off on a boat somewhere.     The boulevard swept through the city  like a long ribbon, curling through neighborhoods. Past apartments and homes, past businesses and coffee shops and car washes, it went everywhere and nowhereit disappeared on both endsone onto the shoreway along the lake, and the other dissipated into an old residential neighborhood with dead-ends and one-way streets.     He passed the Diner where all the trendy boys and their entourages gathered on weekend mornings to rehash and relive their nocturnal exploits over cups of strong coffee and fruit salad. For all the fuss that was made over getting ready to go out, Braden wondered why so many of them didnt seem to mind being seen in broad daylight, unbathed. They smelled of smoky clubs. Their hair covered by baseball caps and do-rags. Some arrived with pillow creases still visible on their cheeks. It was exactly the kind of place Braden would never go for fear of running into someone, anyone. And it all suddenly felt so small. Braden needed out.     Bradens mind wandered back to Thomas, and the memory of him sitting shirtless on deck in the morning sunlight. His gorgeous skin soaked in rays of white-hot light, his sandy brown chest chair and the dark trail from his navel, which disappeared below the towel wrapped around his waist. The vision of it blazed until it was burned and indelible.     But, here was his reality. Here there was no Thomas and no fantasy life on a boat. Here there were messes and disasters and unpleasantness.     And he would, eventually, date all of them.

        garons endommags (damaged boys)      fourteen     burnt     Ben paled as he thought about life after Adam. Somehow, in his core, he knew it would be a very long while before they saw each other again  let alone, actually spoke to one another. It was as if the magic had suddenly run out, completely and without fault. There was no anger or humiliation. There were no hateful thoughts or words. There were no regrets for the trips to Baltimore, the conversations and casual dinners, the parties attended by the new people in Adams life. There was the wistful memory of their passion, the searing physicality of their couplingthe exhilaration of their fitful climax, and the excruciating fall into sadness, the abyss which consumed him afterward, always.     Then, there was also the clarity which came at dawn. The buttery light seeping through the edges of heavy curtains, finding its way to Bens eyes. Things always looked decidedly different in the morning, especially when it was time to go home. The energy was different, less connectedas if Adam was more than ready to return to the sanctity of his other life. And, Ben supposed this was trueafter all, if it had been reversed, he would have been anxious for departure. He would have hoped for few words, too.     Ben thought back over the details of his trip to Baltimore, and filed them away. He would be home in less than an hour, back to the routine of his lifestudying for exams, doing his laundry and flicking endlessly through the cable channels. Somehow this mundane distraction kept him from sliding backwards, into things past.     There was one thing he couldnt erase from his memory, though. An unfortunate choice while Adam was showering. Hed listened to the answering machine next to the living room phone. It did not blink, indicating new messages, but Ben knew Adam. Adam would save any message he thought interesting, or significant. He was rewarded with a seemingly innocuous message from someone named Davidrambling on about the upcoming weeks plans. He thought nothing of it until the message said,   "OK, call me later, baby."   It hit him like a sharp slap across his face. Certainly he wasnt naive enough to think Adam wasnt dating. But somehow, the confirmation of it made him sick with jealousy. This person Adam had failed to mention all the while kissing Ben, sleeping with Benloving Ben. And yet, why should he be surprised? They were, after all, history. But there was a longing deep inside Ben that couldnt let go of Adam, wouldnt stop tugging at himcaused an ache like no other. His lip trembled as the hurt welled within him...tipping over and spilling tears onto his cheeks.    Why had he done that?! He had no need and certainly no use for this informationit only tortured him. And yet, his curiosity got the best of him. When Adam stepped out of the shower, Ben could barely look at him, the shame and jealously welling inside.     Adam asked what was wrong, to which Ben coolly replied, "nothing." He felt sick to his stomach and he knew Adam knew something was wrong, but he could never admit what hed heard. He would never let Adam know hed breached his privacy. He smiled more convincingly and said, "Can I buy us breakfast on the way to the airport?"     Ben was anxious to get some distance between themto settle his nerves, to resort his life and to just think about things.  He couldnt get his mind off David. Had they kissed? Had they slept together? Did he like what David did to him? What was David like in bed? Ben churned the questions over and over in his mind, frustrating himself, stirring his jealousy and making him maddeningly aroused for Adam.     His mind coursed furiously as he disembarked from the plane and made his way to the baggage area where his best friend, Kate, was waiting. Kate was 32, blonde and drop-dead gorgeous. A litigator for a huge firm specializing in environmental law, Kate had enjoyed moderate success since graduating from Marshall in 97.    "Ben!"   "No, dont look at me.Im all red-eyed and bleary."   "Nonsense. You look great. So, how was it?"   "Fine. Its definitely the end."   "How do you know?"   "It just is. Its over."     They piled into the black Jeep Wrangler and headed back toward the city. Kate said, "Im not so sure all these trips to Baltimore are good for you. Promise me youll stop if its torturing you."    "Promise." They rode for a few minutes in silence.     "Oh, and I secretly listened to his answering machinetheres this other guy named David."

       So, last night it took me 35 minutes to go 3 miles. Why, you ask? We got NAILED with an unbelievable Lake Effect snowstorm...first of the whole winter season. Anyhow, I got home and shoveled snow...six inches had accumulated. However, it was all powdery and lovely. Now I want to go skiing!!!!!!!!!!     sigh...

       Weird day at work. We've managed to cultivate an overwhelming culture of panic. Lots of unnecessary freaking out today by lots of different people (I'm being deliberately vague). Suffice it to say, we have way too much work on our plates and we're paying for it now in bundles of stress and anxiety. So, what the hell am I doing updating my blog, you ask? In a word: sanity. I have decided to remain absolutely calm against the hurricane of chaos which has descended upon our cubicles. I found myself becoming defensive and making snarky comments, so I decided I needed to adjust my attitude and maybe everyone else will too. I'm going to work late tonight and complete all of my many tasks so that tomorrow won't be overwhelming at all.  There is no rehearsal tonight, so I'm glad for the opportunity to rest my voice and catch-up with other daily mundane stuff like laundry and grocery shopping. Did I mention that I think I'm going to wear a wig? And blue colored contacts? Yep.

       I think most of my creative energy right now is being expended on rehearsals, thus the extreme lack of writing. However, I expect to be back in the saddle soon...more  urlLink Damaged Boys ...more pithy commentary, etc. In an effort to keep more organized here, I am currently constructing a separate area for posts, links and photos of Apolo Anton Ohno for all you rabid fans, which should be up and running later this week.

        to Chicago and back...     Friday started very early, up at 6am and to the airport by 7:30am. Arrived at Midway a few minutes early, and took the train into the city. I had meetings with  urlLink The Joffrey Ballet  and an impromptu meeting and tour with the great folks who manage the  urlLink Chicago Theatre  (whose marquee you might recognize from this season's  Real World opening credits). After my work was completed, I met  urlLink Brandon  at the hotel and we headed out to meet  urlLink Andrew  and  urlLink Cinnamon  at Uncle Somebody's Hacienda Mexican restaurant before going to see Late Nite Catechism. The show was hilarious, and I'm looking forward to it opening here in Cleveland next year! Next, we had a great sushi dinner at Rise, and then I went to the hotel and collapsed into blissful sleep. For a great rundown of our activities,  urlLink read Andrew's account and see the pics!  It's entry #350.

       So things are shaping up for my trip to Chicago this weekend. My center of operation will be the W Hotel, and I'm planning on seeing  urlLink Late Nite Catechism  (for work...really!) having Late Night Sushi with Andrew, Brandon and Cinnamon and doing whatever else seems fun. I've already said I am going to find the  urlLink Real World  house and have my photo taken in front of it (for work...don't ask).

       I'm feeling a little overwhelmed. I have all this stuff on my desk...and I know, I know...the voices in my head say to just push it all off the desk and into the trashcan. I wish I could do that. There are these frightening towers of paper and other crap...I mean, work...on my desk...looming over me. I just need to focus and get some of it processed through. I have a complete ad plan I need to finish for  Kiss Me, Kate  and tons of work to be done on this new ballet season we're presenting...plus lots of maintenance on the upcoming tour of  Aida  which arrives here in March. So, I'm just feeling a little stressy. Okay, inhale...exhale. Good. Okay, I'm feeling better. Sometimes, you just have to suck it up and take it. Such is life.    I'm looking forward to my visit to Chicago this week...after all, I'm visiting with the folks at  urlLink Joffrey  and meeting the royalty of  urlLink Chicago's   urlLink blogging   urlLink glitterati . I ask you, what could be better?

        at the end of the yellow brick road...     It's weird, we finished up today after a nearly sold-out matinee and hit the whole strike routine. For you non-theatre types, that's when the sets, lights, costumes and all other technical equipment gets packed up and loaded out of the theater. So, you finish your last, show, change out of costume and makeup, meet any friends...and instead of heading off to dinner or a party or whatever, you help deconstruct the very thing you've been working on for weeks or months. It's always a weird time.    Most of us were happy to finish our run, but it's always a little sad to say goodbye. I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to do the show with one of my best friends, Phil, and to have had the chance to work again with Ricki.    I've been on one of the most celebrated journeys a performer can take...a journey in an iconic role, recognizable to 95% of the population...getting to know the ins and outs of a great new character (I was the Tinman once before) and getting to hit the bricks with so many wonderful friends. When I look back over my shoulder, I guess I'll always see Scarecrow, Lion, Tinman and Dorothy (and even Toto) waiting patiently in Oz, at the edge of the Emerald City...waiting to welcome me back. Oz has the most amazing ability to enchant the audience, and how could you not be in love with magic like that? Longing for the very things we cannot see in ourselves, and ultimately finding them, is the magic of this place, and I shall miss it greatly.    Goodbye Scarecrow...I think I'll miss you most of all.

       Matinees will be the death of me.    See, after last night's show and party, I got home at 2:00 AM...hit the sack and woke up at 11 AM...only to have to be back at the theater at 1 PM. So, today's show was great and I have tonight off! Wheee! I wonder what trouble I can get into...hmmmm.  Hope your weekend is fun and relaxing. Check ya later...

       so, the week's flown by and I haven't really made many updates (my apologies to Kelly and other frequent unextraorinarians) but I've been whacked-out on caffeine and staying up way too late at night and rehearsin' and cursin' and lots of other stuff. But, JCS is going very well and I'm trying to be on my best behavior...not going out and getting wasted nightly, not hanging around smoky bars and definitely not huffing glue or turpentine. On the other hand, I am being hyper-vigilant about laughing, staying in touch with friends and drinking coffee and/or Coke. I love Coke.    Yesterday, being all valentiney and whatnot, I managed to accumulate a surprising number of people who agreed (after some cajoling) to be mine...well, for yesterday, at least. Anyhow, it made me realize how many very cool/wonderful people I have in my life. I got to spend time with Kelly last night watching  urlLink The Vagina Monologues  and drinking wine. I spoke with my friend David in L.A. and Lee in Miami...and best of all...a voicemail from Brandon to start my day. Geez guys, thanks for being so sweet.     Heading off to Oz tonight after a quick visit to Dr. Hottie (chiropractor), and then to a soiree at Miss Ricki's (she's our Dorothy). Ciao!

        weigh home     There was the other-worldliness of it, exiting the old movie theater onto Water Street in the center of town, the neon and chaser lights blinking and twinkling off of the wet pavement. Here, at the top of a hill, overlooking the better part of an entire rural county, time stood still for just a moment. The courthouse stood at the center of the town square, brick and majestic in a plot of thick green grass, carefully manicured in the summer by a maintenance staff of three.     And, there were the people of this place, who walked just a little bit slower and took nothing for granted, who lived the country life and let all else come after it. The grocery and the car wash dating back to the fifties were as urban as it got, and there wasn't much thought of the city, or city folk. City folk like me.     But this is of me. I came from a place just like this. With cows and green, green fields and miles of nothing, and tractors and dusty two lane roads. I come from a place of the earth and wheat and organic mirth, the growth of something from nothing. I come from a place where we labored daily, the till and the scythe and the hoe.     There were horses and mules. There were sheep and goats. And my cows.  Sweet Sara and Moira and Della and Katy. I remember the barn cats mewing and weaving between my legs on our way to milk the old girls, getting shifty-legged and restless in their stalls, eager to be let into the fields to graze, to wander. And I wish to be there, too, among the grass and the animals, wandering the fields...returning to the place I once knew.     I cross the street and head toward my car at the end of the block, past the coffee shop and realty office, past the photography studio and the toy store. I head down the steep back road, down off the hill, down into the lush darkness of the quiet valley.     And, even though it's February, I roll down my windows to let in the sweet air of this place. It smells of damp earth and moss and rain, cold rain. It smells of home, back when home was a place like this...

        weekend update     Alright, so we opened  Wizard of Oz  this weekend to a screaming audience of toddlers, and our attendance rocketed to a near capacity crowd yesterday. After the matinee, I had a quick dinner with a few cast & crew, and then rushed off to  Superstar  rehearsal, but not before getting tagged for speeding on my way. Well, I figured that my number was finally up, I mean, I've never gotten a tickets for anything in 14 years of driving. Oh well...at least the guy who stopped me was courteous and professional. He even offered to fellate me, but I said no. Still, he ended up fucking me with a $70 fine. So, I get to rehearsal and sing through the show with the whole cast and suddenly I'm feeling much more, how do you say..."son of God-ish" and I nail "Gethsemane," Jesus' Act 2 rock-aria, just before we wrap at 9pm. Suitably impressed with myself, I wander out into the street to be greeted with the worst snow we've seen all season. Gingerly, I drive home and collapse into bed. How was your weekend?

        garons endommags (damaged boys)       twenty      sans souci     Braden returned to the lonely quiet of his empty row house, lonely to anyone but him. He embraced the stillness and the quiet, revered the emptiness and the solace. There was, invariably, the time when it was necessary to have company, be it family, friends or others. But there was also the time for them to leave, time for the silence and the orderliness. There were two categories in Bradens life, those things that were orderly, and those that were not. It seemed people always caused some period of reorganization in his life.     Relationships were never orderly, clean or easy, for that matter. Sometimes he wondered if it was worth the effort at all. It was much simpler to remain cool, detached and in control. Braden detested the unpredictable nature of human relationships, the brooding, the yelling, the expectations. It was neater to have things clearly explained up-frontno surprises or lies or love. No, love was complicatedtoo complicated.     Braden enjoyed his time alone. But his thoughts wandered to Charleston and to Thomas. He imagined Thomas aboard the sailboat  Sans Souci , face toward the wind and sun, and headed in no particular direction. Thomas had the luxury of complete autonomy over his schedule. He was not bound to the rigidity of a standard workday. Braden calculated a family net-worth well into the tens of millionsThomas wouldnt be needing a day job anytime soon.     He imagined sailing for days together, not worrying, not planning or plotting or schedulingjust sailing and consuming. There would be incredible food and drink, and nights filled with each other, wound togetheran ebb and flow, like the very seawater beneath them, an orderly pairing. There was the crash and retreat, the dangerous undertow of Thomas affection, and Braden could do nothing but capsize into the dream of it, the beautiful sun-dappled fantasy with clean edges and crisp, white linens.     There was, of course, realitya return to the actual life in a faraway northern city. Thoughts of Thomas faded into reminders of appointments and bills and laundry, into the ordinary and consistent. Here, there was hardwood and stone, sharp edges and a cold, contemporary style to everything. And, at once, Braden noticed that the life hed fantasized and the life he lead were polar opposites. Here there was no warmth or light, just the infinite melancholy of marble and speckled granites, the designer furniture and icy chrome.     And, for perhaps the first time in his life, Braden saw himselfa tiny glimpse of the person responsible for this life. And, he realized hed made his own madness, his own subscribed routine. And he alone could change it.     Later that week, when Marcus and Ben returned from the gym, from the secret glances and the fear of rejection from each other, the dawn was barely gray on the horizon. They drove up to the row houses and parked in the garage. Neither of them noticed the sign in front of Bradens, which read,  Metro Real Estate .

       I was reading one of Brandon's recent  urlLink posts  with a lot of interest. In it, he describes coming home and finding one of his drawing curiously relocated. So, he either has a stalker with a key to his apartment, or he's got a ghost...which reminded me of the good old days when I had three of them in my house. Yes, I miss the days of moved objects, strange sounds, ghostly footsteps and a dog that definitely saw and heard stuff I couldn't. But things were great after I bought Ghost-B-Gone! Yessiree...send me $20 and I'll send you the secret to living in a ghost-free environment!

        I only want to say...    Ha! I woke up today in near paralysis. So, I dragged my ass to the chiropractor (my first-ever visit) at the urging of my mother and my friend Phil. Amazing! It really does make a difference! You should have seen the X-Rays! My hips were all way outta whack. Anyhow, after a few adjustments, the sharp pain was obliterated, and I'm left with mild muscular fatigue in the lower back area. Hey, did this suddenly turn into my medical ailments blog? Nah...not really. I promise to get back to the writing soon. It's just tough to write thru chronic pain. But, that seems to be on its way out...   check ya later...

        it is finished    It always comes to this. The final curtain, the last goodbye. It hasn't happened, and yet, I know exactly how it will go...it's always the same. This ending will be bittersweet and cathartic and sad. And when I walk away from that place, it will be a very long time until I go back...and it's merely proximity.

       Wow...incredible week. I owe you all an update (or two or three) at least! Work has been insane, but  good  insane...if there is such a thing. I had some more PR with actors from  AIDA  and one of them, Eric, was a total delight (not to mention handsome). He used to work at Disney with Kristen Willets (now married to Backstreet Boy Kevin Richardson) and Chris Judd now Mr. J-Lo. He indicated that Chris wasn't always necessarily interested in women. My ex-sweetie Lee phoned this week and we had a brief chance to catch-up...he's doing well, slogging thru his residency in Miami and hanging out with his cousin. My best friend Trish arrives in town later this evening to hang out...so I'm really geeked about that! We finally had an amazing lake effect snowstorm last night...and this morning...it's beautiful and unexpected. They tell us it'l be gone by Sunday. Powder is nice while it lasts. Let's see...I'm going to a conference in Charleston, South Carolina in mid April, followed by little more than a week in NYC in May, and several possible trips to Puerto Rico, SF, LA and Ft. Lauderdale. Yikes! Busy season is upon me! Well, hope all is well where you are. I'm heading into the third consecutive sold out week of JCS and can't wait to see all of you at the theatre. I will have CD cast recordings and also videos if you out of towners want to marvel....lol   :::kiss kiss:::

        garons endommags (damaged boys)        twenty-one       walking north     There was the inevitable tabloid news coverage of the entire ordeal...his bad choices aired in front of family and judgemental strangers. Kyle found himself not only in intense physical therapy, but the subject of intense scrutiny. He remembered it vividly, the name-calling, the hate and the violence. It was strange how the words hurt worse than the tissue damage, the broken bones and bruises the color of eggplant.     Hed relived the moment a thousand times over in his head. Hed regretted the whole night. He regretted Daniel, regretted his own low self-esteem, his bad choices and his fear of being alone. He regretted a lot of things he couldnt change. His mother had come right away, of course, and brought with her anxiety, judgement and sadnessas if he didnt have enough of those things. But, she was there at least, and it was better than no one at all. And, when it became apparent he would make a full recovery, she could encircle him with blame, scolding him like a baby. Maybe he needed to hear it.     Kyle missed Braden. No, he missed being with someone, anyone, who could make him feel loved and wanted. And, with that, Kyle turned a corner and started to understand himselfa little.    The weeks of recovery and rehabilitation were grueling, and hed promised himself hed get through it in time for the spring thaw, and a summer full of camping and hiking. He loved the escape from the city, the opportunity to be in the middle of nowhere, responsible only for himself. He kept a picture of the dense green forest in his minds eye to remind him what lay beyond the sterility and exhaustion and pain of recovery.     Kyle dreamed of the swallows alight on the evening sky, and the cool trickle of an unexpected spring deep in the pines. He imagined the rolling hills giving way to the mountains and the perfection of the trails in Virginia and North Carolina. He dreamed of hiking north on the Appalachian Trail and making friends from strangers, and being liked for being himself. When he was in seventh grade, he and his best friend Randy Bicking, planned to hike the entire AT when they turned eighteen. They even plotted where they would have mail drops, where they would overnight and how they might make enough money to pay for the five-month excursion. Hed not thought much about it after Randy moved away at the end of their freshman year in high school.     His pulse quickened. It seemed, to him, that this might be the answera journey all his ownaway from the madness, away from the hurt and the fear, away from the Kyle hed come to hate. It was a way of sorting out the detritus of his life, shifting perspectives and putting distance between himself and his not-so-distant past. At once, it seemed obvious and absolutely right. If he could get strong enough by early April, he could set off to Springer Mountain near Amicalola Falls, Georgia, and start walking North toward Katahdin.

       Hey! Well, it was fantastic! We sold out the whole weekend, and are on course to be completely sold out for the entire run! The audiences loved it and gave us multiple standing ovations...which none of us expected. We were overwhelmed by their warmth and generosity. Yesterday's matinee was cancelled due to a major power outage...one that left my house without electricity all day Saturday. I enjoyed the day off after a long week of seven performances. Tonight, I'll be able to go home and stay there for once...

       Ha!  (Tongue planted firmly in cheek)  I'm still here. Final rehearsals are going well. The orchestra quit two nights ago - in what was one of the biggest and dumbest diva-fits I've ever seen. Apparently, the issues are all ironed-out now and we have them back. Whatever. I'll show 'em what a REAL diva-fit looks like if they just don't sit down, shut-up and play their friggin instruments. Oh, and by the way orchestra freaks...I play the title role...and your bitch-asses better start showing some respect!  LOL. Things I've learned:   1. Glucose-based stage blood smells like cherries but tastes like barf.   2. Strobe lighting mounted 12 inches above your head can induce seizures even if you're not epileptic.   3. There is nothing glamorous about taking your bow drenched in stage blood ( a la  Carrie )   4. Convulsing and writhing in pain whilst crucified on the cross will draw gasps of awe from the audience.   5. I look good in my Jesus-diaper loincloth.

       So, things are good...just a bit busy. I'm in perpetual motion, going from office to home to rehearsal to home to bed and then again to the office. This, of course, doesn't leave much time for anything else. It's the kind of routine where having the chance to watch 15 minutes of television is quite a novelty, and where doing the laundry seems like a lovely idea since it's not part of the daily crush. In any case, things are well, and I'm looking forward to the big gala opening night this Friday.

Thankfully, tech is finished today at 5pm, so I'll have a chance to get home and relax before hell week begins.

        This Jesus-ing is hard work.   I suppose it's not enough that I show up on time, know my lyrics, blocking and the dumptruck-full of directing minutae which has been heaped upon me. No. Above that, I have publicity, interviews and photo calls...and most recently, a wig fitting. Let us not forget the nasty bruising and general abuse to my body which the entirety of Act II unleashes upon me...flogging, beating, crucifixion, etc...All this while incapacitated by this nasty bronchial-cold-sinusy thing which has made it very difficult to sing well. I am looking forward to resting a little tonight at home, organizing my life a little, watching a movie and drinking lots of hot tea. Tomorrow, I'm getting on one of those slick touring coach buses and taking a group of media-types to Pittsburgh to see  urlLink AIDA , which opens in Cleveland on March 12. Anyone want to go with? I have a few extra seats...

        clouds in my coffee...   It was that song  Fast Car  by Tracy Chapman that did it. I was swirling the cream in my coffee this morning when I heard it wafting from the sound system above me. Immediately, I was back in high school, talking to Ken and Matt about being in a fight in downtown Cleveland. It was the day after Thanksgiving, and we were downtown for the Christmas lighting ceremony...3 high school boys wandering around the city. On our walk back toward Public Square, we were approached by two city boys (roughly our age) who announced that they were thugs..."thugs that mug." Well, Ken and Matt were both on the wrestling team, so they were set and ready. However, the only fighting I'd ever done was choreographed as part of  West Side Story . What was I going to do, fend them off with showtunes? In the end, nothing much happened, there was a mini-smackdown on the sidewalk, a brief chase up into the crowded square and a quick disappearance of the "thugs...thugs that mug." We were all safe and uninjured...just a little ruffled around the edges. I'm sure Tracy Chapman would hate that  Fast Car  reminds me of a downtown skirmish, but I'm always startled at how immediately I am transported by music...and there I was...downtown on a frozen November night some thirteen years ago..with the world spinning beneath me.

        page not found .  I hate it when bloggers quit. I don't know, it just seems like every time someone walks away, they leave this void...a void where there used to be content. My friend Charlie, the Blogstalker, is one of the best friends I never had via blogging. He's in New Orleans now... he doesn't update much, if at all, I feel like I've lost him, you know? And, hey, I know people blog for different reasons, so sometimes people just reach the end. I get it. I do. But even so, I'm sad to see my friend Verdezza hit the reset button on his. It's the nature of the beast, and new writers will provide new content, fresh perspectives and maybe new friendships.   I guess it never gets any easier to say goodbye.

         I can't find my flashlight.   It was one of those Maglites...the ones that weigh 5 pounds  before  you load the batteries(I am certain they're made of lead). I think I must have cleverly filed it away somewhere during the move in December and can't unearth it now. I am looking for it because sometime in the past two weeks, my dryer vent has stopped venting to the outside of my house. I realized this when the basement was transformed into a rainforest during a drying cycle last week. There was  actual rain  in the basement from condensation forming on the cold water pipes. So, how do you fix something like that? Well, checking out the dryer vent tubing is a good bet...except it's helpful to have a flashlight. I've snaked it with a spare garden hose...from the exterior of the house and the interior. SO, I have no idea what to do next. However, in the search for my long lost flashlight, I found three hammers. How did I manage to accumulate  three  hammers?? And, it's not like they are 3 different sizes (which might be helpful sometime). So, if you are psychic...would you tell me where my flashlight is?

        if it's Tuesday, it must be Charleston   Pardon my absence. I've been traveling a lot lately. Last week, I visited Charleston, South Carolina, for business. I had an opportunity to really enjoy myself for an extra day or so. Who wouldn't love a city like that? Old Southern charm, lots of European influence, great cultural scene, lots of terrific restaurants and clubs, wonderful shopping and gorgeous weather...not to mention the living history of the place. After spending four days at home, it was time to jet off to Toronto with my friend Phil. We had planned this trip for over New Year's, but Buffalo, New York, got snowed-in, so we decided not to chance it. We are having a great time up here (posting from Canada now) shopping, walking, drinking, etc. It's a nice getaway inthe middle of a very hectic quarter at work. Anyhow, I know it's been awhile since I wrote, but I promise there's more to come...

        Can you ravel?    It was almost a year ago that I was experiencing the end of a short-lived but very intense dating-sitch...lest I actually say 'relationship.' Time always provides perspective...and fodder for gossip queens. Anyhow,  urlLink unravel in 58  has inspired some amazing correspondences with many people across the globe...people I now count among my friends. It's funny...the way universal experiences can make friends out of strangers. So, it's fair to say...I feel totally raveled back up now. But, if you like watching train-wrecks...have a read...and maybe a laugh...and don't worry...I think Dan already read it.

        you know it's been a weird week when your dog looks at you funny...   And he did. After all, I've left him with my parents for about 30% of the past 2 months...but more than that, he can sense when things are a little, well... off . Given the events of last week, I feel pretty good about things, mostly. When I went to NYC, it was for both personal and professional reasons. One of my best college friends, Lisa Steinfink, was getting married to her perfectly wonderful guy, Richard Goldstein (nice Catholic couple)...make that  Doctor  Goldstein (whose sister happens to be Lisa Brenner who had a featured role in Mel Gibson's  The Patriot  kissing Heath Ledger). Anyhow, wedding completed, May 20th was my birthday. I spent a good part of it with  Verdezza  the author of the infamous and now vaporized blog of the same name. Dezz kindly escorted me down to the WTC site to show me what little there was to see. What struck me was how small a space it really is...well, smaller than I thought. We had a nice dinner together...and it was truly one of the nicest birthdays on memory...thanks, Dezz! I forgot to mention it when the news of Bob's death overwhelmed me. I finished out the conference on Thursday morning...and gratefully headed back home that afternoon.    So, Friday begins with this hottie appraiser who has been dispatched by my mortgage broker to case my house. After he leaves, I head into my office to try and dig out from underneath an avalanche of...stuff. The high point is getting to relax with some theatre friends...I had the chance to visit with Connor and Ricki, Phil and Jill, and Chris and Matt. Good to spend time with all of them again (I wish I got to see more of Ricki and Connor...I love them to pieces!). Saturday, I had Bob's memorial service at 11a and Julie's wedding at 3:45p. After enjoying the beautiful wedding and reception on the shores of Lake Erie, I fell into bed, exhausted.    Sunday was spent with the family, extended family in the morning....immediate family in the evening...with shopping for landscaping stuff wedged in the middle. When I woke up on Monday, I didn't even want to venture outside my yard, but Kelly convinced me to join her for breakfast...which was the nicest 2 hours I've spent listening and being listened to...thanks, Kel...you'll never know how much I needed that...but maybe you do.   I visited with neighbors last evening at a block party cookout...lots of new faces and many of the old regulars. It was thoroughly...odd...which is all I'll say about that. There was nothing quite like coming home and locking the door.   hasta...

         I guess this is goodbye old pal, you've been a perfect friend  ...  Monday, May 20,  was my birthday, smooshed in between weddings, meetings and Broadway shows. Happy Birthday to me. Although, I must admit, I am feeling every bit 31 years old. Tuesday, May 21st, I saw the revival of  Into the Woods  currently running at the Broadhurst. It's one of my favorite shows, one I starred in three summers ago...in fact, I started this blog as that run was ending. One of my favorite theatre directors, Bob Stegmiller, invited me to audition, and I had the immense privilege of playing the Wolf/Cinderella's Prince...and using the original Broadway costumes (a rare treat). Bob was also responsible for keeping me working in the theatre at a time when I had no self-confidence, when I felt I had no real talent. In 1987, he plucked me out of a crowd of 250 other people and gave me the role of  Peter  in  Jesus Christ Superstar . It reinvigorated my love for theatre, and inspired a confidence I had long since lost. 15 years and over 40 featured and starring roles later, I owe a debt of gratitude to Bob...for the simple act of believing in a hopeful 16 year old.   I sat in the Broadhurst watching a gorgeous, but absolutely uninspired, production of  Into the Woods  wondering why Bob's magical production wasn't on that stage. For the first time in my life, I actually thought we shoulda been up there...our company was so much more dynamic and energetic and talented... honestly . Ah well, such is life in the commercial theatre.   When I returned to my hotel room after the show, I received a message that Bob had died earlier in the day. He had suffered a massive coronary, and after 30 minutes of attempted resuscitation, he slipped quietly away. Ever since his stroke last week, he'd been improving, but his heart didn't hold out. I'm so glad I got to see him last week in ICU...I'm so glad I could touch him, talk to him and make him chuckle about his cute gay nurse. I will miss his amazing presence and his incredible spirit. Thank you, Bob, for always believing in me. Thank you for taking a chance on this kid. Thank you for your friendship and love.  Namaste  and Godspeed.   Sometimes people leave you halfway through the wood...  Do not let it grieve you, no one leaves for good...  You are not alone...  No one is alone...   (Stephen Sondheim,  Into the Woods )

       Sometimes things just get weird. Like yesterday. I find out that a friend of many years has suffered an apparent stroke and is in the ICU at a local hospital. Talk about a sudden shift in perspective! I don't know too much about his status, other than he's paralyzed on the right side of his face...which may be temporary. I am planning on going to visiting hours this evening to see what I can find out.     update   Well, I got to spend about 8 - 10 minutes with Bob before the nurse kicked me out for not being "immediate family." Apparently, the steady stream of folks up to the ICU has made the unit a little testy. So, they kindly gave me a few minutes and then booted me, ever so politely, out of the ward. Bob has very little use of his facial muscles right now, but the docs are hopeful for his recovery. More later...

        garons endommags (damaged boys)      twenty-two     if I was the one you chose...    For Marcus, nothing seemed to matter anymore. He was listless and indecisive and unsure. From outside glances, his life looked perfect, ideal. To Marcus, it was far from that. His life had become complicated and mundane. His work, no longer a source of stimulation or interest, slipped into neutral. He coasted on his own knowledge equity, relying on his good relationships with vendors and customers. He lived in the ether, floating from meeting to meeting, not quite in a fog, but disillusioned in a cloud of his own despair. His routine was merely a track, guiding him forward, or arguably, in circles. And it all made perfect sense to him. There was every reason to feel lost and nowhere, without anchornot caringbecause no one really understood what it was like to be him. And that was, perhaps, the loneliest revelation of all. Not that having someone care was some sort of cure-all. Sometimes people cared too much, or cared too much about the surface things. He was surrounded by lots of people all the time, but no one really knew him.    How is it that Mister Successful could be suffering depression? How could it be that Mister Handsome was alone? What was wrong with him? Why do we measure success by varying degrees of misery? How can you measure happiness or satisfaction if you barely remember the flavor?    His heart ached. He longed for some simple, deep satisfaction. He also knew hed have to find his way out of this very dark forest and into the light. And, like most other times in his life, hed likely make the journey alone.     Marcus remembered being in elementary school and worrying about forgotten homework assignments, or forgetting to study for a test or looming science projects. Just thinking about it churned his stomach, stirring ancient anxieties. His teachers would hate him. He would fail. He was a bad person. But, it was always his mother who would sit on the side of his bed and talk him through his academic demons, using logic like a sorceress to calm a jittery fourth-gradertalking him through it until there was some resolution. And, there always wasa reasonable end. It was from those nights that Marcus learned about solving his problems, thinking things through. And, even though he couldnt see the light at the end of the tunnel, he would, eventually.      He missed Michael. He missed the way things used to be. And, even though he refused to allow himself to live in the past, it was ever more difficult to escape. Michael was the one person by which all other lovers were measured. No one had yet managed to eclipse his love for Michael. Not that he hadnt tried.     Things were different now. There were many years, and many miles, between them. And when college ended, and it was time to choose paths, their lives diverged. And it was not because theirs was a fading love. It was practical. It was foolish to delude themselves with romantic notions of being together. At the start of ones life, one never imagines theyve had the good fortune of finding their great love, their one true. No one thinks that. Endless possibilities lie ahead, a future riddled with exciting, incredible new people. The problem is, by the time you realize your good fortune, too much time has passed to even fathom finding your way back.     Marcus knew he had missed his one trueand that was the root of this stark, emotionless reality. And, he stood in his life, still and silent and hoping for Michael, wanting to be chosen, knowing he had waited much too long

        Happy Mother's Day, Mommy!   even though I know you don't actually read this...happy day, anyhow!  So, in the midst of Hell Week at work, I decided I needed to get back to my athletic roots, which, if you know me from way back, you know that means running. I have always worshipped my big sister...so, when she started distance training, so did I. She made the Cross Country team, so did I...etc. Anyhow, running was always a great source of exercise, discipline and endorphins. I also have always relished the sense of accomplishment that accompanies running any distance. So, I've recently hit the trail with a novice training program...working toward running the distances of 6 to 13 miles (what I used to run regularly). Already I am sore, but you can't buy the serene bliss that accompanies the training. I forgot what great mental focus it brings...such clarity. Anyhow, that's what I'm up to...

        le bodegay   Le Bodegay is the name of St. Maarten's one and only gay bar (at least, when I was there). I loved the sign because even it was sorta in the closet. It read: Le Bodega   y. In any case, since my work cubicle is sounding more and more like a gay bar, what with all these diva remixes pumping nonstop (thanks to Mixmaster Brian Sayre), I figured I may as well start charging a cover. I don't have a kick-ass light show yet, so for now, I'll flick the fluorescent lights on and off to the beat...I may even invite DJ Moby or DJ Skribble to sit at my credenza and pump out tunes, MTV-style, yo! I'm not sure how my superiors here will take to my scheme, nor am I certain that I will be able to obtain the necessary liquor license. Well, whatever...the point is: if you stop by and hear the thump-thump thumpin, I wanna see some dancing...that's right...go on and bust a move!

        damn, it's Monday...   What the?!? Wasn't it, like, Saturday the last time I checked? I spent yesterday running a few errands and keeping up with the gardening while my parents are on vacation. Little does my mother know, but I've managed to kill everything at my house except two pots of petunias. I think everything is safe...I am a competent waterer.   Yesterday, I went to see the movie  urlLink My Big Fat Greek Wedding , which was one of the most humorous and touching movies I've ever seen! If you haven't already, get your ass to the theatre and see it! And no, I didn't go see it because Joey Fatone is in it (for like, 20 seconds).

        garons endommags (damaged boys)      twenty-three     into the wonder     Ben was tired of feeling injuredemotionally injured. Things never seemed to work out. If there was hope, it always seemed dashed in the end, usually with some bizarre twist. Like an episode of  The Twilight Zone , complete with Rod Serling narration, Ben watched his life unfold with a sense of fascination and horror. Why were simple things so difficult? Why was it nearly impossible to achieve a degree of normalcy and serenity? Hed watched Marcus become more and more closed off from the world, obsessing, no doubt, over his past with Michael. Why did he all but disappear every time he became sullen and swollen with nostalgia, grasping pathetically at some idealized vision of the pastcompletely unclouded by reason and sanity?     Thats partly why he was so excited to visit Tuck and to hang outgossiping about friends, dishing about men and catching-up on the latest from the bar scenesomething he had long since abandoned. The weekend party would be just what he needed to get his mind off of his everything and his nothing.    Tucks new place was only ten minutes from Ben, located right off Shore Road and nestled between some old-growth trees and the endless rocky coast of Lake Erie. It was the sort of high-rise condo that looked like it didnt quite belong - nothing over three stories did. Tuck was one of those new money fags who had the best of everythingat least it was stuff that looked pretty. Including whomever he happened to be bedding at the time. His life was like some glorified combination of Martha Stewart Living and the best of Crate and Barrelonly the colors were more muted and subdued, which seemed ironic to Ben, since Tuck was neither of those things.    Benjamin, darling, weve been waiting for you. I want you to meet Indio, I told you about Indio last week, remember?    Indio was exactly the club twink Ben had imagined, complete with a boxed blonde dye-job, multiple piercings, tattoos and bad vocabulary. He gave them two weeks, max.      Ben surveyed the room with raptor-like eyes, sharply scanning everyone in the room, looking for exes or potentially embarrassing encounters. So far, so good. With a keen awareness of the attendees, Ben meandered through the comfortable, over-decorated rooms, noting with some delight, the apparent absence of any real taste.     That is when he spotted Sean, making his way down the hallway toward him. Sean smiled to brightly, with such familiarity, that Ben thought he might already be acquainted. As Sean moved closer, he was relieved to see that he was, indeed, a total strangersomething very unique and very intriguing given the relatively small size of the gay community. Sean didnt walk so much as he ambled. He was comfortable and confident and smiling at Ben. Looking directly in his eyes, sparkling with possibilities. Not even a hint of psycho drama queen anywhere.  This was good .     Hi. Im Sean. Whats your name?   Ben.   Nice to meet you, Ben. I was just about to leave, but seeing as youre so handsome and actually willing to talk to me, Id love to buy you a drink.   Ben smiled and said, theyre free.    I know, Im kidding.   Ben laughed and relaxed a little, enjoying the unexpected encounter with this dark and handsome stranger. Someone new, he thought.  A totally blank slatethe best place to start. They chatted eagerly for nearly an hour until Sean announced that he would be leaving with the friends who drove him, but could they please keep in touch? A proper date, perhaps?    As they exchanged numbers, things looked a little different to Ben, which is not to say better, exactly, but interestingfascinating and intriguing.    Im sorry I have to bolt, but they are my ride. I wish I could stay and talk to you, get to know you a little bit.   Well, well have to do that sometime over dinner or a drinks or something.   That would be perfect! Ill look forward to hearing from you.     There was an awkward and burning moment where there might have been a kiss, and then the odd, sinking resolution of a polite handshake.    With that, Sean disappeared into the sea of well-dressed and over-cologned men.    Ben stared right into the face of new possibilities.    Finally, there was something other than Marcus.

        from seven this morning   Toby lept across the sealcoated drive toward the wet morning grass and in one swooping, giant loop, made his way back to the passenger-side of the car and lept in without effort. I'd packed my things last night in order to ease departure and reenter my life in the city and at work, and to finally see my house for the first time in five days. I had mixed feelings about leaving. Given the circumstances, I would never have expected to have so much fun spending time. Certainly, parts of it were difficult...both emotionally and physically, but his daily progress was a true inspiration and a reminder about simple gifts and quiet miracles. I left him in a better place than when I first took over a primary caregiver...he's bounced back to his old self, while ready to leave some of it behind...a little at a time.     It's almost 10am and I'm flying through piles of paperwork and unanswered emails...astounded at how fast everything returns back to the way it was...  a restoration of my simple and comfortable routine.       Well, at least for today.

I am going to go spend a few hours this afternoon with my dad, so we can celebrate Father's Day together. I know I am biased, but I definitely have one of the best dad's around. And no, I am not kissing-up, he doesn't read this thing...   Talk to you all later. Much love, and thanks for stopping by!

        notes from the scene of recovery   I'm approaching my first twenty-four hours being on call at my friend's house. He's back from the hospital and progressing nicely. We're not sleeping much...he because he can't get comfortable, and me because I'm on alert & not sleeping deeply. On the bright side, he's in his own house and I'm glad to be able to help out during this very tough transition...although it's turned me into a bit of a mother hen. Toby is with me and we're making the best of a difficult situation. It is lovely to be out here in the country in all the lush greenery. I am getting caught up on some reading and have started to work on some writing. I must admit, it's hard to concentrate while keeping your senses on high alert! I'll keep you posted. In the meantime, keep both of us in your prayers...him for healing and me for patience.  Blessings...

        dating flashback   Back in the day, when I was a flaming heterosexual, I dated this great girl named Mary for about a year and a half. Mary and I met one summer while we were both working at  Sea World . Things were going great until she ran up to me crying and all upset one day. She said, "Why?! Just tell me what's wrong?!?!" And I was all like, "What are you talking about??" And she said, "You know!" And I said, "No I don't. What the hell are you crying about?!" She went on to tell me that there was a note attached to her timecard, a note supposedly from one of my friends at work saying I didn't want to date Mary anymore and she should just move on and not talk to me about it...and that I didn't want to discuss it. Of course, I had no idea what was going on and it became clear that someone was meddling with our relationship. How f*cked up is that?! In any case, Mary and I stayed together for another year before she moved away and I realized I was gay...which was more shocking than any forged note on a timecard.

        bounce right back   I visited my best friend in the hospital tonight. He's had a bit of surgery and made it out to the other side with flying colors. I didn't realize how stressy I was feeling until I received the phone call from his parents letting me know he'd come through okay. It seemed as though all of my anxieties were lifted in that moment, and only then did I realize how nervous I was.    In my short 31 years, I've had too many lessons about mortality, and too many friends leave this place prematurely. So, faced with the seriousness of any surgery, I guess I was fretting a bit more than I thought. But, it brought it all home to me once again: the fact that the little stuff  just doesn't matter . My friend is an extraordinary pigment in my life, and no matter what happens elsewhere in my life, that friendship is something way more important than spending time worrying about, well, stupid things. And while I understand that I am merely human, and thus prone to weird behavior like worrying and self-doubt, I am also a good person (insert Stuart Smalley joke here) who deserves only cool shit to happen to me. So, to life, I say:  bring it!  (especially if it's loads of cash and/or scantily-clad soccer players).

         INTO THE ETHER... and other stories    this week:    Teflon Self-Esteem  or  The Bermuda Triangle Boyfriend   What are you supposed to feel when your date from last week goes M.I.A.? I never mentioned it last week because, well, I just didn't. I guess that after the whole Dan debacle was chronicled and published last year, I wanted to be a little more careful in how I approached the dating scene in regards to my blog. In any case, I met a really sweet guy last week...we'll call him "Rick." Rick just walked up to me, a complete (but totally hot looking) stranger, and handed me an ice-cold Corona (my drink of choice that night) and introduced himself. I have to admit, I am a chickenshit when it comes to the whole introduce-myself-to-a-stranger thing, so I was impressed with his chutzpah! As it turned out, he was a completely charming and handsome, if not a tad shy, person. Anyhow, we exchanged numbers and went our separate ways when the bar closed.    We made plans to hang out on Wednesday last week. It was a casual, low-key kind of date...just talking over a couple of drinks and hanging out. The whole evening was relaxed and fun...we had a great time together. We spoke on Thursday and talked about getting together on Friday. Friday came and went with no word from him, so did Saturday and Sunday. So, the fun little unexpected date once again goes rancid. Whatever happened, I hope he's not lying in a gutter somewhere sick or dead. Ah well...    Whatever...  As my friend Trish says, "Where'd he go? Doesn't he know that you'll have another boyfriend in like, ten minutes?!"   As soon as I learn anything, you can bet I'll lay it all out for you right here... watch this space.

I didn't sleep much last night and I'm dreading going into this one...I just hope to stay awake. I'm sure  they  hope I stay awake! Anyhow...   On the homefront, the flowers that I planted in my front window boxes are dying. Mystery. The flowers on the side of the house are fine...and in the half-barrel and various pots. However, the vinca and the black-eyed Susan are languishing...turning many dark, unhealthy shades of  dead . I don't know what to do...along with the decorating gene...I somehow missed the gardening gene...the one that allows you to accomplish any landscape scenario with some degree of fabulosity. In any case, as the front boxes are wilting, I have to come up with some replacement plan... thinking ...

        Dr. Tom doesn't live here anymore.   Remember last summer's frustrating romantic adventure with Dr. Tom? If not, check the archives...there's plenty-o-bellyaching about it...I just don't feel like linking it at the moment. Anyway, today was move-out day...he's headed back home to Kansas...so that's that. I have no idea who my new neighbor will be, but I'm thinking he may be less messed-up than Dr. T. I do wish Tom well, though...   So, my worlds collided a little this past week. My "L.A. Boyfriend" David, who was the former best-friend of Lee (ex-love of my life), ended up at a party with a certain unnamed minor celebrity (with whom I had a short fling last year). David knew about UMC, but UMC doesn't know that David knows. How entertaining is that?!   Kelly and I are attending a political fundraiser tomorrow evening at the Tree House. Gee, the last time we went to a fundraiser there, I ended up kissing a straight guy (on a drunken dare)...and so did Kelly. Drinks and politics are a very strange mix. She, at least, got a couple of dates out of it...my guy went home to his wife and kids.   After the fundraiser, I have to scoot out to an acoustic performance of some of the material from  urlLink The Sissy Show . Sounds like a goddamned busy day....

         wade into the river    I'm sorry I didn't say anything sooner. I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to say to you...    Last Wednesday, July 24, one of my grandmothers died...Grandma Stuart. My mother phoned me in New York to say that she had passed quietly away in bed at 11 that morning. The reason I didn't know what to feel or what to say has to do with a deep family rift that occured well over twenty years ago...a rift that fractured our family, and ultimately split my father's siblings along a complicated and painful fault. How are you to grieve for about a person you barely knew? How do you mourn a shadow, a faint memory of someone significant? I don't have answers to those questions. I didn't know her...and I wished to have known her as an adult, that we might have talked and enjoyed each other's company.    There will be a memorial in August, bringing back together the family for the first time in decades. And while the years of hurt and anger won't just wash away, maybe we'll find some shred of something, some level-headed connection to help mend what is threadbare. Can we, together, span the crevasse? Rebuild a bridge that was burned long ago?  Connect ? I know that I am ready to wade into the river...and try.    Goodbye, Grandma. I have not seen you, I have not known you...but I have not stopped loving you.  I hope there is peace where you are...

        questions...   How is it that you can adore someone totally undeserving of your adoration?   How do you survive an entire summer with hormonal teenagers?   When does what you're doing become an obstacle in the greater scheme of your life?   When do you become your own biggest obstacle?   Can you overbook your life to disinclude any meaningful human relationships?   Have you already done the one really interesting thing in your life?   Do you prefer blueberry or banana nut muffins?

       This past week reads like  urlLink  The Great Gatsby  , although sometimes I'm not sure if I feel more like Nick Carraway or Jay Gatsby. No, I haven't moved to West Egg, but I did have to jet off to NYC to tape a television special this week. We're doing a half-hour about our upcoming Broadway season, and had interviews with people from  urlLink The Producers ,  urlLink The Full Monty ,  urlLink 42nd Street  and  urlLink Disney's The Lion King . In between all of that, there were walks around the city, people-watching and meetings, there was shopping and dining at all the best places. There was ash-colored scenery and train rides from Penn Station, cocktail party invitations from mysterious strangers and secrets. Never before has a trip to the City been more intriguing, participating in the day-to-day life, rather than scurrying around to meetings and performances...seeing only the night time. Here, I was amidst the day people, rushing around to work, believeing myself in someplace new, entirely. It was at once familiar and enthralling. People scuttling up and down subway stairs, past 125-foot high advertisements, not blinking...not connecting. There were vendors and peddlers and beggars, there were accountants and actresses and worried television producers. And it was all there at once and completely inconsequential to me. As I shifted through the rush-hour herds at Penn Station, I felt quite like Nick Carraway, heading away from my Manhattan enchantress toward the more sensible, the more regular West Egg.

If you find yourself anywhere near Chagrin Falls between now and August 17, stop in and check it out! You won't be disappointed!! I'll try and post a pic or two when I get them.

        garons endommags (damaged boys)      twenty-four     the space of two houses     No one would take note of the orderly row of townhouses which had sprung out of fallow fields of urban blight, disrespect and hopelessness. Where once there were working-class homes and yards and porches, there came the demolition machines, and years, if not decades, of emptiness. Lots plowed under by the city, barely leveled so that one could still make out the outline of the house, and the sinking earth where once stood foundation and cellar. In these times, grasses and wildflowers grew in season, inviting butterflies and birds to alight there. There were sedge grasses and buttercups and dandelions. There stopped hummingbirds and bees.    In the months before construction, the field where two houses once stood was filled with rural life, condensed and reconstituted in the city. Here, this land was perfect and regenerated. Serving a purpose. Then came the clearing of the land, the leveling and the digging for a new foundation. In the space where two houses stood, there would soon be five units, five very narrow townhouses, sharing one structure. Shoe-horned onto the block.    Daniel stopped almost daily to watch the progress of the construction, noting the changes and the obstacles. Hed watched with pride as his new home was built brick by brick. Springing forth from the brown field of the old, came the glittering new, perfect and exactly as planned. It fit his personality, it fit his dream and his schedule to own his home, and to be master of his tiny universe.    Daniel watched as if in slow motion, the arrival of his neighborscasing each of them. He and Jeanine thought they were progressive enough to live in the predominantly gay neighborhood, never fully realizing that they would be the only practicing heterosexuals actually in the building. Braden, Ben, Marcus and Corey were all gay.    In the weeks since his indiscretion with Kyle, Daniel had grown more silent, more inward and detached. He thought back more frequently about the days before their arrival, and everything that had changed since.    He had no idea how to approach Jeanine, what to say or even what to think. His actions were beyond his own explanation. It seemed that not saying anything made it a little less true each day that passed.    In the intervening weeks, Braden sold his unit and Corey was conspicuously absent. Or so he thought.    Jeanine had been staying up at night, unable to process he husbands growing disconnection. She was at once unsettled and perfectly securesecure in the idea that there was someone else. Within the thousand different ideas racing the circuit through her brain, she would never guess Kyle. But she had noticed Corey.     She wouldnt have if shed been asleep next to her husband or making love to him. Since she shared her nights with silence and the kitchen table, shed noticed Coreys comings and goingslate. Very late. There were never men coming home with him, but she quickly exacted his extracurricular activities with a twinge of horror and fascination. She would talk to him. With at least one decision made, she could sleep again, and joined Daniel beneath the covers.    She smoothed the quilt over her, clearing the creases and folds until there was nothing but the perfect flat fabric covering her body. At least she could control that. At least she could keep something clean and smooth and under control. With no kiss or murmur, she fell into the gray haze called sleep, and escaped for one more night in a line of a hundred just like it.    And the distance between them grew as large as the space of two houses.

       sorry for the lapse. I had my friend Trish out for the holiday weekend and have been running around getting into all sorts of trouble. Okay, not really...but we've definitely had fun! So much so, that I seem to have come down with a particularly nasty summer cold. Yes, it's the same cold I get every summer around this time. Last night's list of symptoms and ailments included a 101 degree fever and dizzy spells. It doesn't get better than that, folks! Anyhow, today is TECH day for  FOOTLOOSE  and I'll be spending all of today in a darkened theatre. More later...

        from the unextraordinary email box:  a note from Marc J.     Tod, in the end, all you can do is keep writing. Whatever you do, don't stop. I know it may not feel like it, but people are reading and thinking about the things you post. I suspect they're feeling more than they're thinking, cos I think you tend to make people feel and react, sometimes without knowing that's what's happening. Anyway, I just thought you should know.     -Marc J.   people actually read this thing?!

        whither must I wander    If you try to be clever and funny all the time, you and your blog will burn out and go away. As we can see by my blog's longevity...I am neither clever nor funny all of the time. Alas, I have seen many good men and women come and go. I was pondering my blogging and/or lack thereof lately, and it's interesting to note when and where spurts of writing activity kick in. I haven't yet figured it all out, but from my perspective, it's interesting.   2002 was the year of the move. So many of my friends, family and exes all packed their shit up and hit the road for new homes elsewhere. This year, I sent off Kelly (not too terribly far away), Dr. Tom, Dan (unravel in 58 fame...watch out those of you in San Diego), Steve...and, well, you get the picture. I bet you can think of someone who packed it up this year. Weird...but I kinda like how people drop what they're doing and  shift .  urlLink Andrew  mentioned that his best friend Brandon is going to move to San Diego (hey, I know this guy that just moved there...), so that counts as another friend who is moving. It all makes me ask, can we change our lives by changing our location? Are we a nation of Jimmy Buffetts? Changes in latitude, changes in attitude?    I have grown used to saying goodbye to people...and I mean that in the least melodramatic way possible. I'm used to it, I just am. Sometimes we want everything to remain the same, and sometimes we want everything to change...and some of us are stuck somewhere in between. Either way you look at it, I suppose it's good to stir it up a bit. I guess change is change, but it's not always a solution, or more accurately, the total solution. Many times, it's stop-gap until we get to the root of what's really eating us. Change tends to peel back a few layers, like a sticky bandage on a wound...revealing sometimes the painful, sometimes the scarred...and sometimes the healed.   So, you are travelers, journeyers...go find what you seek, that mysteries may be revealed.

       Toby's been a bit under the weather, so he went to the vet today. 42 bucks later, he's got this FABULOUS Elizabethan cone collar to keep him from chewing his lower extremities to smithereens. What's funny is the fact that he's a 7-pound dog with a HUGE plastic collar on...he looks akin to a satellite dish...and he's REALLY clumsy. I feel half bad for him, but the rest of the time, I'm laughing hysterically at him loping around with this enormous plastic hoo-ha. Quite entertaining! Prognosis: he'll be back to normal within 72 hours...at which point, the collar can come off. Until then, he's my low-tech in-home entertainment system.

        notes from Fawn Island   My journey began in Cleveland on Friday afternoon. I spent lunch with Kristin (from JCS and Footloose) and then headed to Bridge House to retrieve Toby and my personal effects. The drive was estimated at 3.5 hours, give or take 15 minutes for construction projects blooming like wildflowers along the turnpike. Eric phoned my mobile for the first time as I edged slowly forward in the first bit of construction hell a few miles outside of Detroit (Rock City). I was already running late. By the time I reached Eric's house in Washington, Michigan, it was 6:23...I should have been there by 5pm. We were never going to make the 7pm ferry, so we would aim for the 8pm. We gathered Toby and my weekend bag and loaded into an enormous white pickup truck, almost as wide as it was long. The drive to the St. Clair River was only 45 minutes. We crossed the main part of the river quickly, and met the Fawn Island Ferry shortly thereafter.    Fawn Island rests in the middle of the river. It is Canadian territory, but with clear views of both the American and Canadian shores. Fawn Island is the summer residence of maybe 30 families and a large assortment of purebred dogs. Toby and I fit right in...Toby being purebred, myself being Canadian...somewhat. There is no commerce on the island, just housing. Each cottage/house is rigged with everything you need: electric, water, sewer, telephone lines...so it's not  that  rustic...but you are, after all, on an island in a river (much like La Grande Jatte in Paris).    Michelle is one of my best friends from home. We met when we worked together at Sea World, and became even closer when we attended The Ohio State University for several overlapping years. We won State titles in Speech & Debate together, and we lived together for two years. All of this puts her into a category of intimacy not many others share. Eric, her fiancee, is a wonderful guy...they met at law school at MSU...not long after she decided she probably would never meet someone and get married. I guess when you finally give up the ghost...that's when you get it. Anyway...   Michelle and I have not spent any real quality time together...largely due to my crazed schedule, but not for her lack of trying. This weekend was an important step for me, as I move toward reclaiming my life from my almighty schedule...to do things I wanted to do, not because someone was counting on me being there (even though she was) it was definitely my choice to go. And you know what? It made a difference.    I am tired of being places because I am expected there. If I continue to do that, surely I'll die with a booked agenda. Believe me, a booked agenda does not a life make. It just makes you  busy . I miss the loss of my own free choices, and believe me, I'm not blaming anyone but myself. I must start saying no without the looming guilt. I want to go places because I  want  to, not because I think I should. Did everyone else learn this in Fifth Grade?? Was I sick that day? Was I tending to something that needed tending?   Spending time with Michelle and Eric reminded me of living with Michelle. Actually, it reminded me separately of living with Kelly and Leisa, too. These were times when anything and everything we did seemed like a special event. We could be watching a movie or doing laundry, but it was somehow special or interesting because we were doing it together. Does that sound weird? I think about watching the Sunday night lineup, and I remember that it was more of an  event  when I was living with Kelly. It was something to look forward to...to talk about while we prattled on about our mundane chores. With Michelle, it was always the chatter about what we were doing, or what crazy workloads or classloads we had. Somehow it was all interesting and delightful. And perhaps, most importantly, it was not lonely. I think the isolation and introspection one has when living alone can loom large and silent in the room with you. Simple things are dull again.    Spending time with Michelle reminded me about myself a little...things I had forgotten. How is it that one person can color your life so much? How can the experience of sitting in the same room with someone be so vastly different than sitting in the same room, watching the same TV program by yourself?    We can't go backwards, but we can make different choices. Tonight's choices: mow the lawn, do laundry and clean up around the house. Certainly not glamorous, but I did them joyfully because I knew that somewhere in West Park and somewhere in Michigan, two of my friends would be doing almost the same things...and we'd watch the TV programs separately, but together...   And I can smile and remember what is was like lending an ear or sharing a bottle of wine...

        going there   Life keeps getting more and more interesting. Last night, I had the chance to meet a friend of Kathy's, someone who may be joining us on the next leg of  The Sissy Show  journey. Beth is of the pretty and talented variety, and I think she could add a lot to our show. As we prep for what seems to be an ambitious fall season on the road, an opportunity to perform Off-Broadway seems to be looming in the distance. I'll share more about this as it gels. How funny to make my New York debut wearing a dress...not exactly how I'd imagined it...

       Christmas in August.  We're a little late this year, I guess that's an understatement. Each year, my friend Marge and I exchange Christmas gifts months after the actual holiday...a silly tradition born of overcrowded holiday schedules and family commitments. So, tonight we exchanged gifts at a lovely little restaurant called Zin, near Shaker Square. I received a lovely sweatshirt and fleece pullover, plus some Starbucks coffee, candles and gift certificate to Pier 1. Not bad, eh?

       It's weird when you have a little distance from things. Perspective shifts and you feel a little more grounded, perhaps. It seems like more and more time is programmed, which is no one else's fault but my own. I am looking forward to a much needed trip to a cabin in the Canadian wilderness...on Fawn Island. Toby and I wil head up there on Friday to spend time with college friends this weekend. I can think of nothing better...a little rest, relaxation and reflection...

        Goodbye, Bomont...   Well,  Footloose  has finally come to an end. 300 costumes to get filed away under "miscellaneous '80's" and giant yellow and purple sets to be dismantled. As we closed the show, I couldn't help but think about the countless closing nights I've experienced on that stage, and many others...and the thing that always surprises me is...how  similar  they are. There's this odd mix of brooding and excitement, plus the mundane chores of striking sets, cleaning the dressing room and saying goodbye.    I had a good time this summer...it was time well spent. I dedicated my work on the show to the memory of Bob Stegmiller, who, at the time of his death, was still arguing with me about doing the show. He wanted me in it, I didn't. In the end, I succumbed...and had an amazing 8 weeks with the show as stage manager and as one of the handful of adults in the show.   I learned to love teenagers, for all their quirks and hormones, and I loved remembering being 17 or 18...and  just  like them. Maybe that was the whole point of the exercise. Maybe we see ourselves in looking back, a little. I recognized myself...an awkward teenager coming to terms with his sexuality...and I winced a little.    Today, I'll run a final show-related errand: I must return the roller skates we borrowed...and then it's totally over for me. I am not sure how many of them will actually stay in touch, but I hope that they do. After all, this crusty old stage manager is going to miss them. A lot.

        crossing the divide   The memorial service for Grandma Stuart was this past Saturday at St. Andrews, a lovely rural church nestled somewhere between Kirtland and Mentor. It was the scene of our first ever family reunion in over two decades. I am overwhelmed by the time I spent with my family, people I knew, but seem to have only just met. I have a better understanding of myself and of my place in the world because of it. I can't relay how absolutely extraordinary it was to be with them. We are learning. We are familiarizing. We are laughing and crying. Together. Huge family rifts don't mend overnight, but we've made gigantic steps forward. The service was beautiful and heartfelt. Afterwards, we took a family portrait, the only one in existence...made more meaningful by the fact that all surviving family members were present. Then, my Uncle John decided to invite everyone over to his house on Sunday, so we could spend more time together. Remarkable...people really were wading into the river. I know all of my cousins and I felt absolutely high after spending time together, and vowed to keep it together this time around. In between the laughter and games and remembering, there were tiny green chutes...evidence of the thaw...and the promise of spring.

        from the  Melodramatic Journal Entry  Department (circa 1994)   They take form and devolve, like apparitions, figments I could barely remember. But, like the scent of it, some things we never forget. I remember when you were here, in this life, and we'd run toward the lake and sing as we crumpled under the weight of our own laughter, in the grass. We'd stain our knees and cuffs in verdant hues, the sky our floor...and the meadow, our ceiling. There was no end to it then, an endless train of nights and mornings, hitched together with purpose. We were foolish and reckless then, never anticipating change or death or vanishing or the simple end of it.    Like infinity, you skate an elegant figure eight in and out of me, and the tunnels and burrows have become slick and hardened, letting you pass through without sticking, quite without notice at all. Would I glance or glare? In one moment, you want my face to flicker recognition or absolution or hate, but I cannot do it. And I look blithely away, toward something...anything else.   No, you are not a part of my reconfiguration. I left that a long time ago and I have no interest in building something out of rot and mirage. I am constructing the new oasis from sky and grass and laughter. I am a construction of ages old love and memory and bitterroot. There are things I cultivate, and things I discard. There are no questions without answers, and so I move forward, toward everything I fear and everything unknown.    I wasn't that I didn't love you...

       Jury Duty does not give me great comfort or faith in our judicial system. It's slow. It's clunky. It needs streamlining. It is not the best that it can be. I worry about the quality of the decisions being rendered when I look around at the folks sitting in the jury pool with me. If I ever had a jury trial, none of these folks would be considered my "peers." So, we almost made it to our 4pm dismissal time, but one last judge asked 16 of us to come in again tomorrow at 9 to go through the screening process. I am hoping to be screened out of service. Perhaps I'll be found to be too smart, too handsome, too accomplished at critical thinking...who knows. Wish me luck...I can't take that little green room any more. BLEH!

        jury summons   I'm not sure if I'm supposed to even mention it, but I am going to jury duty today at 1pm. This is interesting to me because, after all the elections I voted in, I've never been called to jury duty... ever . So, I get to see the inner workings of our justice system. I wish I could blog from there, but  I'm sure  that's a no-no.

        somewhere in the past year...       I remember thinking how excited I was when the weather turned nice last spring, and that I couldn't wait to hit the trails for a summer and autumn full of hiking and biking. Now here we are, at the end of summer, staring into the gullet of autumn, and I have yet to hit the trails...even once. I know it may not seem strange to the casual reader, but understand that hiking and biking are among my most favorite activities, and the fact that I have denied myself, really bothers me.   I know we're all busy, but when is busy...too busy? How can you avoid overbooking yourself so much that you don't notice until, well, you're overbooked? There must be some early warning system available. If there is, I have yet to recognize it.    Slowing down is a good thing. I am excited that  Guys & Dolls  opened last night and will close after only 4 more performances, leaving my schedule blissfully open for the first time in months. I am eager to get back out to the National Park and hit the trails. I am eager to get back into my gym routine with Kelly. I need to get back to the things I used to do...if only to ground myself a little. I feel like I am living in a life that feels so totally foreign to me. Does that sound odd, or do you know what I mean?   Anyway, somewhere in the past year, I've lost sight of it and managed to ramble busily everywhere else but inward. From my vantage point today, all I can see is a much clearer schedule, no looming commitments to anyone other than myself...and that feels pretty damned good. I need some time to work on me, to figure stuff out and make a plan. I guess when you wake up and you're 31 and you have almost everything you could want, maybe it's time to focus on new goals, new dreams and do a lot of deep soul searching about...something,  anything . I think satisfaction is terminal...and boring. Who wants to sit around sated all the time? It's nice to experience every so often, but if you don't leave the plateau, you're dead.   See ya 'round...

I need a phone call   Maybe I should buy a new car  I can always hear a freight train  If I listen real hard  And I wish it was a small world  Because I'm lonely for the big towns  I'd like to hear a little guitar   I think it's time to put the top down      I need a phone call  I need a raincoat     Words & Music by: Adam Duritz

        karma chameleon    I guess some things do come 'round again to bite you in the ass. I talked to a friend today who said, before he moved to San Diego, Dan ( urlLink unravel in 58 ) was fired from his job at an ISP for, ironically, being on the internet, or misusing it or whatever. So, he'd been unemployed for about a year, traded in his high end automobile and headed west toward true love...or something like that. Amazing. See, interesting things happen to interesting people.

        brittle choices    Do you remember what you wanted to be when you were little? Or even what you wanted to be when you started college or vocational training, or whatever? I went to Ohio State as undeclared, even though I knew I wanted to do something, anything, with theatre and/or broadcasting and/or writing. As it turns out, working in entertainment marketing and public relations is a damned good match...but that was more or less accidental.   I've been thinking a lot lately about my friends who have found themselves, somehow, not quite where they expected. Friends who made it through law school, but not past the bar exam. Friends who have had major professional accomplishments, but have nowhere else to go. When we find ourselves at the end of the sidewalk, what's the next step? Do we hike backwards toward some other opportunity, or do we leap into the abyss?    Is it practical to dream? When you are over 30 years old, is that allowed? Or are we supposed to walk down some predisposed pathway toward the banal, the mundane, the ordinary?   I think when we were in our late teens and early twenties, possibilities seemed endless and we were less likely to limit ourselves. Where, exactly, do we lose that perspective along the way? I venture to guess that most of those opportunities are still available to us, even though we can't see them, or sense them like we did when we were younger and stupid (and I mean that in the nicest way possible).   What's to say me and my thirtysomething friends can't consider ourselves undeclared, like that first semester at college? Why can't we just hit the reset button and see what happens? Are we too defined by choices we made at twenty? Do we get another shot, or are we too far gone?

        garons endommags (damaged boys)      twenty-five     pluie dans le nuage     The unit sat empty for four months. The windows remained dark and lifeless, much like they did when Braden lived in those rooms. Everything remained as hed left it. The furnishings and accessories were all there, it was all for sale, and it was better that way. Better to say goodbye to all of the old belongings, the old way of living. He was in a new life now. A life where there was no use for chrome and stainless steel. A life where there was warmth and light. He would not decorate his new home to reflect the month of November.     Braden visited once more to make final arrangements and walked through his former home. He was careful not to switch on the lights or to draw attention to his presence there. He didnt need the neighbors to notice. He didnt need to explain his absence. He didnt want to look into their questioning and judgmental eyes. No, best he should keep quiet and not attract anyones undesired attention. He walked through this place he formerly called home and wondered aloud if anyone had actually ever lived there. It was as if hed barely left an imprint, nothing remotely traceable to him. No evidence that this place was of him, carefully crafted and controlled. In the end, hed designed himself right out of it. There was no proof of life here. If anyone had asked, no one would know that Braden was ever here at all, and all at once he was reminded why he needed this movewhy he needed this total transformation.     As he walked through the living room, he noticed a dark coin on the floor. He examined it: an old penny dropped by one of the prospective buyers, no doubt. It was not his, and if there was luck in a found penny, the luck was not his. He left the copper disc on the floor where hed found it. Someone else needed it, not him. He locked the door behind him and slipped down the block before anyone had noticed he was there at all.    Braden was done with his life in this city. Braden was becoming someone else, someone who liked shades of gray, and shades of satisfaction and maybe even happiness... maybe . Charleston was home now. Charleston had colors and warmth and people stewed in sea and sun. Things smelled of rain in the sunshine and of clean cotton. Things were perfect and exhilarating and undone.    Ben and Marcus noticed it first. They were returning from the gym when the sold placard stared garishly red at them, plastered along the upper length of the For Sale sign.     Corey had seen them in and out of the unit several times recently, the woman and her son. Sandwiched by the straight people, he thought.    Daniel and Jeanine were introduced to the new neighbors by the realtor, Maxine. Jeanine liked them. It would be nice to have another woman in the row of townhouses.    Ellen and her 18 year old son Ryan moved into Bradens old place on Saturday. The large moving trucked pulled up, and within five hours, had completely unloaded the sum total of their lives into their new home.    Ryan liked the sleek interior, the contemporary feel, the sense that he was urbane and special and living in the city. He was eager to start school in the winter quarter, just after the first of the year. Even though hed be living on campus, this would still be an amazing place to call home. It was a far cry from the 19th century farmhouse theyd owned when living in Wallingford. Hed surmised that this was the perfect place in which to start over, and hed wanted that more than anything.    Ryan, your soccer stuff ended up in my room, do you want it in your room or do you want to take it down to the storage room?    Ill take it downstairs. No need for reminders of high school now. All of his championship team memorabilia could be stowed safely away.    Ryan took the large box down the steps into the clean cement-floored storage room just off of the garage. He paused and looked through the box. There were trophies and plaques, soccer patches not sewn onto his varsity jacket, certificates and photos. He looked at the photo of him and his best friend James after their Districts victory. They were both so high on the win, happy to be on the best team, happy to be together. The photo caught them in the middle of laughing, arms casually flung around each other enjoying the moment. Ryan smiled as he switched off the light and took the photo upstairs.    He missed James. But it hadnt been the same since the whole gay thing happened. It had been months since theyd even spoken, but it probably was for the best. In time, maybe, but for now, well, life had to move on. And, for the first time, he didn't cry...there was no more rain in the cloud.

        in the end.     There was the ending of it. I know he didnt see it coming, and I think thats why Im doomed to never see it coming (my karma being what it is and all). Or maybe its because you can  never  see it coming, barreling down the tracks at you like a runaway locomotive, ready to derail at the slightest anomaly.     I began to wonder why it always ends that way, with someone utterly and completely surprised. Then again, sometimes we do see it coming and we look away, until that horrible moment of impact.    The airlines and other passenger carriers have the NTSB to conduct post-disaster investigations. But who do we have? Wouldnt it be helpful to have an impartial investigation conducted on the details of each romantic disaster?     There are those times when I know it was my faultfor whatever reason. And I look back and hope that I didnt do too much emotional damage, although I fear I may have. I always end up wondering how theyre doingeven years later. But the danger of actually finding out is like opening Pandoras Box. In the end, it seems like youve unfurled the welcome mat. Then what do you do? Be a jerk again? No, better to leave things alone and hope theyre okayfrom a safe distance.    Negotiating ones way around ones former significant others is tricky, at bestespecially if you happen to live in a small to medium sized city like Cleveland. After awhile,  theyre everywhere .     Best to try and end things on a civil, if not friendly, note. This brings me back to my initial thought: how can you achieve that if its going to be a horrible surprise in the end, anyway?    You cant.    You just have to plow forward, knowing youll be seeing all of them again. Not to say it doesnt make you seriously consider relocating to another city altogether, but why should you have to move?  They  are the ones who were stupid and didnt see the end coming. Stupid people should move away.  Far away .    Then, I guess, that means that I should move away, also. After all, Ive been stupid, too. In the end, wed all just be moving around trying to avoid the uncomfortable, inevitable truth: were all flawed, and there is no escape. The way karma works, youll only end up running into them anyway.    So, you might as well stay put, stupid.

        almost said hello.    this time, it was the New York I've always wanted to visit...    If you want to know the truth, I've never been in love with this city...which is why I think the natives think I'm one of them. This is not to say I don't love the city, I'm just not  in love  with it. You must know there is a difference.    I dressed for the evening and headed toward the theatre district...trying, at all costs, to avoid the inevitable throng of tourists along Broadway and pulsing in large globs around Times Square. It's so much easier to just take 8th or 9th down,  then  cross.    I get these headaches when I come here. I think it's due to my constant lack of hydration. I'm terrible at remembering to drink water and such when I am home, and I'm worse when I'm on the road. This time, however, I remembered to drink lots of it. So much, in fact, that I am in the midst of what I believe to be the most extensive restroom tour of midtown Manhattan. I've made poor beverage choices on past trips. Not that the beverages were of low quality, but rather...it speaks to my inability to stop ordering them when I'm well past... quenched.  This trip, I've consumed numerous bottles of water at every turn: in meetings, at parties and even now, as I type this. The bottle of Volvic gleams pale blue on the table next to me and I am compelled to imbibe.   I wake up at 3 in the morning disoriented and cold. The air conditioning has been pouring out all night and the room has chilled down to a frosty 62 degrees. The thin cotton blanket and crisp sheet cannot keep out the cold. I stumble from bed onto the cold hardwood floor and click the AC off. Then, there is the requisite visit to the bathroom...me hungover on water.   When you walk here, people don't look at you...much. Except for me on  this  trip. It seems everywhere I walk, people look and I see glints of recognition and then dismissal...as if they were disappointed I wasn't the celebrity they'd thought. Wandering here, almost twenty people have almost said hello.   Tonight, after the theatre, I walked along the sidewalks stuffed with glassy-eyed tourists clutching Playbills and wandering aimlessly along Broadway. Have you ever seen a sidewalk packed like sardines, and if you walk at the seam, between the two opposing sides right where the traffic meets...you can move, rather than wait for the cattle ahead of you.    There might be love in this city, but I doubt it. No one looks happy. Not even the pretty people. Not even the pretty people seem very pretty anymore. Maybe they've just given up. Maybe they're just tired of all the effort it takes  being  New Yorkers.  There is no mystique here...only movement. And  that  is the one thing that  never  changes. In the end, she was well behaved and gracious, and for that, I have nothing but thanks.    adieu.

       Dear Sis,  I am currently writing to you from the all-too-chic Hudson Hotel on the edge of the Upper West Side and Hell's Kitchen. I don't have enough black in my wardrobe...that's what I've managed to figure out while here.    I met with Philip tonight and handed him the new CD. He seems quite excited AND excitable...which is how people should feel about our show. I think he has quite a good surprise awaiting him upon his first listen...    Again, you've done remarkable work with the new recording. I forgot to remind you to put the new Cowboy TV vocal on...the stale old boring one is still on this version. Are we gonna change it? Do I need another new take?    Ah well...   Hope all is well with you. Much love to you and Lucy!    Cheers,  Todd

        meetings are fun.   Here in Manhattan, everything is more fun than in the boring, old provinces. Even meetings. We're about 25 people, in all, huddled around a marble conference table in a beautiful room somewhere deep inside Lincoln Center. We talk of successes, disasters, ticket sales and swap ideas, strategies and jokes. But more than that, when the meetings are over, we are in one of the most amazing cities in the world...everything at your fingertips. Even though things get rocky every now and then, sometimes it takes trips like this to pop me out of the rut...get me away from the maelstrom if even for only a few days. Things look just a bit better from this perspective. And that's good.

       Well, I survived the family vacation in Virginia...even two rides through Sniper Alley on I-95 in Maryland and Virginia. I'm reporting live right now from NYC. I'm here to attend a conference and see a few shows. I saw Kathleen Turner and Jason Biggs in The Graduate tonight...it was quite a disappointment. Both of them seem to have merely a limited bag of acting tricks when it comes to this particular play. After twenty minutes, the show became a distraction from my inspection of the clever and smart technical design. That's never a good sign...   The city's alive with people enjoying the brisk fall weather. I will be meeting with one of the potential producers of the Sissy Show's NYC production. Oh, and I wanted to let you know that the newly recorded and mastered cast album is an amazing leap forward! Quite a fun listen! I'll let you know when it hits the market.

        where is angelique silva?    Today, after a particularly grueling day at work, I arrived home to an odd bundle of garbage strewn about in my yard. It was in the section back near Bridge Court, a quaint red brick alley that runs directly behind my house. At first, I thought the neighborhood dogs had managed to drag a whole trash bag out of the can, but as I approached, it looked more and more like... homework.  The bag was, in fact, a black backpack which had been torn, leaving the workbooks and papers scattered around. I don't understand how the backpack came to be there, but I gathered up all the papers and books and the tattered sweatshirt and piled them onto my side porch. The homework papers and quizzes revealed that the bag and its contents belong to Angelique Silva. From the looks of it, Angelique is in 4th or 5th Grade, and is an  excellent  speller. She achieved a 32 out of 32 on this week's quiz. Nonetheless, I wonder what has become of her, because, by the looks of her belongings...she was either really pissed off, or her bag was stolen. At any rate, I hope she's alright...

        little satisfaction to be had...   Not to be too maudlin, but it's been rough lately. It seems there is an interminable amount of drudgery and unhappiness to cope with here at work...and if that sounds really dramatic, well, I guess  it is . The point is to try and reverse the evil curses that have befallen you. There's no way to tell if you've been hexed, cursed or fallen victim to voodoo spells. I am fairly certain that I'm suffering from all three. October is the month to deal with these types of things and I am fairly certain that someone out there can offer me some sage advice. How does one un-curse one's self? How do you get to the root of an Amish hex? Do you do the voodoo undo done unto you? Weird forces are at play in my life right now...dark clouds have gathered and a chill wind blows...

       Things seem weirdly different to me right now. Not in a bad way...just  different.  Perhaps it's the fact that I am finished with my insane rehearsal and performance schedule. Maybe it has to do with the busy season setting in full swing at work...effectively numbing me from my own boredom. I sat at my office today quickly ticking off the things on my list...feeling efficient and productive, but I was also thrilled to not have to bolt off somewhere else at 6pm. I could concentrate on my work and not worry about discharging myself at the prescribed time. Whatever it is, it's a welcome change. I am enjoying having my time back under my control. I told you a few weeks ago that I was working toward regaining control of my schedule. It's been like containing a wildfire, but slowly, my time is again my own. So, that's all fantastic, right? Well, what about the humorous and inevitable battle with boredom? Learning to slow down becomes the challenge...not meeting each impulse to busy myself. My life has been busy, cleverly tying moment to moment with various events and people, but there was always a through-line, something else to move onto...and that's not been the best way. Sometimes, you have to get off of the train. Sometimes, you have to walk to your next destination. Sometimes, you have to let life happen to you. You have to let people happen to you. Sometimes, you have to stay where you are and let the world go on spinning around you. Kinda scary. Kinda necessary.

       OK, OK...so I was a little wound-up when I wrote that last post. Forgive me. It's been a wee bit stressy around unextraordinary.com these past few days...our host was hacked, bumping us offline for 3 days, and I wanted to get on and update the whole court situation. AH well...   Friday, I was seated on a jury for a minor traffic offense trial. The charge was minor, but the trial was fascinating. The City of Cleveland had the burden of proof, and we as the jury, felt very strongly that they did not prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the verdict was  not guilty . I enjoyed my time listening to and deliberating the case. I still stand behind my statement that the system is clunky and needs streamlining and have already submitted several suggestions, like...give each member of the prospective jury pool a pager...which would allow them to be anywhere within a 10 mile radius of the courtroom. People could go to work (if it was close enough) or shopping or to the library... anything  but sitting in that little room for 8 hours. You would have 30 or 45 minutes to report back to the court, and if you didn't, you'd be found in comtempt.  Anyhow...it's good to be back...

        garons endommags (damaged boys)      twenty-eight     went unsaid      There were three of them, scattered about the country as if God had thrown them like dice. And, it seemed, for awhile, as if none of them would ever find home again.     Connecticut Avenue sprawled out for blocks in front of him, as it did every night on his walk home from work. Hed take the subway to the M Street stop, and hed walk the rest of the way. Tonight, the stars were sprinkled across the winter sky, brilliant and winking. Hed thought it strange to see the stars so well in the city. He couldnt ever remember seeing them here. But, there were many things he hadnt noticed in the months since hed moved there, in the months his brother had been found dead in Los Angeles, a victim of depression, asphyxiated. Matthew had completed law school, passed the bar and was already working for a prestigious L.A. firm when the depression deleted him from the world. Outwardly, there was nothing to notice, except for the success and the drive and his accomplishments. Hed worked hard all the way through his undergraduate at Wake Forest and at Stanford, completing his law degree. His family was supportive, but never knew the whole truth. They never understood himcompletely. Everything had seemed fine until the phone call at 4am from his roommate Thom, explaining the horrific details, collapsed their world into oblivion.    Matthew was a good soul. He inherited his fathers sense of duty and mission to those less fortunate. He took special care of those ailing and afflicted by HIV and even spent a summer on the African subcontinent assisting in clinics, if only to offer moral support, or a hug or a smile. There, hed met Thom who was a direct services manager for UNICEF, stationed in Addis-Ababa, Ethiopia for a year.    By the time Matthew had finished his summer, they were madly in love with each other and dreading the enormous distance between them. They vowed to remain in touch. And they did. So, when Thom finished his tour of duty, hed relocated to the west coast to be with Matthew. It was there that Matthew first began his life as a gay man, living with the person hed loved more than anyone else, ever. It was there that hed begun his terrifying and lonesome battle with depression, a battle hed lost one night in November.    Michael was living at the opposite side of the States, having moved to D.C. from New York, where hed worked in the French Embassy. Hed been transferred to the Office of Consular Affairs in September, before Matthews final, wild descent into suicide. It was more complicated than he could imagine, not that hed ever wanted to imagine his brother dead. More than that, Matthew was his twin, a part of him, and he was terrified that whatever got to Matthew would be quick on its heels to devour him as well. It made for fitful sleep and worrisome days. And, he was tired of talking about it. Tired of explaining it over and over. Exhausted from the grief, sleepy from the late night and endless tossing and turning, haunted by his brothernever knowing if it was real or imagined. Hed thought of happier times, simpler times, when there was life and lovewhen there was Marcus.    His walk down Connecticut Avenue seemed refreshing and different. Something had changed within him, and it was indeed welcome. There was a sense of emerging, a sense of regaining himself and his life. If only the pieces could come back together as quickly as theyd fallen apart. There was the challenge. And, truth be told, Michael was not good at all with puzzles.    Adam had managed to find his way to Miami, seemingly, by chance. Hed always claimed Seasonal Affective Disorder, but Ben knew better. Adam was always dissatisfied with the way things were, with the status quo. If he was in Cleveland, it was the weather or Midwestern mentality. If he was living on the West Coast it was complaints about the cost of living or the accumulation of freaks. When he lived on the East Coast, there was nothing but distain for the attitude and the verbal sniping.    Somehow, hed managed to find a sense of peace and belonging in Miami. Maybe it was the club drugs. Maybe it was the clearly defined sense of purpose: his medical residency or maybe it was truly the one place there was nothing wrong. Ben suspected that it was a matter of time until there was something wrong with Miami, but for now, Adam was content. And that was no small matter, indeed. It was Miami where Adam seemed to do a lot of growing. Hed made realizations about his past choices, about his past life and relationships. And more, hed shared these revelations with Ben.     Maybe they were supposed to be together after all. Maybe it was just one big waiting game, speckled with failed relationships. Both of them regarded their years together as the best overall, and it always went unsaid what seemed to be obvious to Ben.     There were ten years and four different cities between them, and maybe fifteen different lives. There was no one who had remained so regularly in his life, no one who had ever loved him like Adam. More and more, he was convinced hed met, lost and then become almost a brother to the great love of his life. Nothing seemed clear. There were no obvious choices to be made. No bold steps to be taken. So Ben did what he knew besthe waited.    Adam doubted he would ever have the pure and total love of someone like hed had with Ben. There were too many failures since then. He and Ben were wildly different people than the boys they were ten years ago. Adam had believed in true love, and at 22, had found it in Ben. But, it was ever elusive. He thought hed collided with it once or twice since, but there was no doubt from this present perspective that it wasnt even close. Oh, hed wanted it to be...maybe even willed it to be, but it wasnt, and it vanished each time like being startled out of a long, sleepy dream. In Miami, hed managed to find a bit of himself, and looking back, didnt like everything he saw. But, that was the way it was; there was nothing he could do to change the past. He could only look ahead toward some distant horizon, out where the cruise ships and sail boats fell out of view and off of the planet. He wondered about things. He thought of Ben up north and smiled. And he waited.

        garons endommags (damaged boys)      twenty-seven     jump in the lake       He didnt know why it hit him just then, but Ben remembered it like he was back there, back in high school and pining. His stomach felt like it did then, knotty and tight, like he would vomit his affection for the entire world to see; and he could think of nothing more horrifying.    Ben remembered working at Hicksons the summer before his junior year at Kenston. Hed hated almost everything about it. Hicksons wasnt exactly just a gift shop; it was also an old-fashioned sweets shop, Christmas store and restaurant. It was a cluster of turn of the century farm buildings that had been converted into this odd assortment of shops. At 16, Ben was truly the lowest man on the totem-pole with duties ranging from push-mowing the 2.8 acres of grass, to washing the steps and cleaning the bathrooms.     Somehow, his first taste of real work didnt suit him, even though he was good at it. There were the women shoppers always gawking and clucking and chattering. There were co-workers, but none who did what he did. He was the heavy laborer as far as everyone else was concerned. He lifted and toted and reached things on the upper shelves. Once, hed managed to break a grotesque Royal Dalton mug of some sort. The faces bulged and stared out from the shelves until they were purchased.    When he started the job, he was trained by the person he was replacing, an eighteen year old senior named Wade. Wade went to school in the next town over, but Ben knew of him. Hed seen Wade play soccer. Wade diligently explained every last detail of the odd jobs that would be foisted on Ben. He told Ben that he was leaving because it was too difficult to find enough time for school, soccer and a part-time jobso the job had to go.    Wade stood just shy of six feet tall. He had nearly jet black hair which was cropped short. His frame was lean and defined; he sported an end of summer tan and a mouthful of perfect white teeth which glinted every time he smiled. Ben was instantaneously smitten, and while he did not understand yet that he was gay, he knew he was infatuated. He was as enamored as he was in the second grade with his summer camp counselor, Leif. Leif was gorgeous and tan and sweet and smelled of clean linen. Ben was seven and knew nothing of sex, but he wanted nothing more than to be with Leif, to sit next to him, and to love him as much a seven year old couldlike he loved his chocolate lab, Checkers.    Ben flushed, embarrassed. This was ridiculous. He was sixteen and had no use for elementary school crushes. But the more he tried to dismiss it, the more he wanted to be around Wade.    Ben rode his bike the three miles to work, and every day passed the subdivision where Wade lived. Now that the school year had started, Wade was busy with soccer and other extracurricular activities, living the most exciting life ever, Ben imagined. On more than one occasion, Ben rode his bike through the subdivision, hoping to catch a glimpse of him coming or going. Wades house was a large white colonial with new landscaping and a winding asphalt driveway leading up to the garage. No one ever seemed to be departing or arriving. In fact, it barely seemed a family lived there at all.    Eventually, Ben quit his job at Hicksons and his crush on Wade tapered off. After college, Ben heard that Wade had graduated with honors from the Naval Academy at Annapolis and was now stationed in San Diego, flying helicoptersand married.    There was this theme in his life, wanting the unattainableyearning for what could never be his, and it always stung, like it was new and fresh.     Ben walked down to the shore in the evenings after work, to think and to rearrange things in his mind. He walked along the edge of the gentle surf, lapping at his bare feet. Marcus was no different than any other crush or infatuation. He would never have Marcus, Marcus was impossible. There was no other option but to live next door and participate in this odd little friendship that was fragile and impenetrable.    Ben wanted to wash it away, rinse the residue of childishness, of unrealistic desire, of rejection. He removed his clothing and folded into a neat pile on the beach, ran into the lake and dove beneath the surface, where the quiet and the cold cleansed him, soothing past injuries, past foolishness.

       So, I hit the trails again yesterday. I decided I was long overdue for a hike in the woods. This time, however, I was not alone. Toby (my 13 year old, 8 pound Papillon) decided he needed to go with me. I couldn't avoid the pleading looks he was shooting me as I gathered my hiking gear. I finally crumbled and brought him along for the short 5 mile hike in the Brecksville Reservation of the Metroparks. He was an amazing little trooper! He dropped into a very Zen-like place and kept pace with me the entire time. Mind you, there was a light, but steady, drizzle the entire hike. By the end, we were both drenched down to the bone and he looked really silly. You've heard the term "drowned rat," right? Toby looked like a wet guinea pig. Poor thing. The amazing thing was the incredible beauty of the woods on a wet Autumn day. We saw three deer...one was a multi-point buck we startled deep in the more wooded section of our hike. He was majestic and gorgeous and perfect. It was one of those moments you can never really describe. It was amazing to hit the trails...because it's less about the hiking and more about the things you figure out along the way. That's the true beauty of it...

        garons endommags (damaged boys)      twenty-six     something beautiful      Corey was looking backwards, maybe for the first time in his life; he was considering the choices hed made, wondering if it made any difference at all. He often thought not. But today, sitting in a holding cell in the county court house, there was nothing to do but consider. Hed been sitting in the little mint green room for six hours, since hed been processed and booked. There was little left to do but make the telephone call to his parents, and to wait to make his appearance in court.    He met the john in the Market Square area of town, normally a safe and discreet place for such transactions. It was well lighted and highly trafficked. It was not the typical place hed make the connection. This, perhaps, was his major mistake. If hed only suggested a meeting among the warehouses along the wharf. If only hed insisted on a reference, or somethinganything, he might not be in this situation.    It was true that most sex workers are arrested at least once, if not many times in the span of their professional careers. Corey had stupidly bet against the odds. He was, after all, a legitimate entertainer, and being legit, felt he could fly just beneath the radar. Hed been stupid about this, and greedy.     Corey was escorted down the hallway by a bailiff when the court docket was set for the day. Hed be seen by Judge Mathis. Ironic, really, because hed voted for him in the last election. At least, he thought so. There were too many judges to keep track of in the city, but Corey was sure hed voted for this guy. Not that it would help him here.    Something clicked inside of him. He could see out of his eyes, like lenses at the end of a tunnel. It was like he had retreated inside of himself. He could see everything going on around him, but it was distant and loping. There was the bailiff and the clerk and a large assembly of other people like him and their families.    His father had all but disowned him when hed come out to them in college. The shock of the prostitution charge would most likely destroy what was tenuous, at best. No, there would be not revelation to his parents about his legal matters. Better to keep that safely tucked away for as long as possibleforever, if possible.    The judge asked him for his plea. He looked at the floor in front of him as he declared his guilt. Corey received a two-thousand dollar fine and 100 hours of community service and a terse admonition. He was processed and released within an hour.    When he reached the outside, it was gray and drizzling rain. He relished in the freedom hed taken for granted only a few hours before, and promised himself to figure out a better way through life. If there ever was a red flag, this was it. He was determined not to let it pass without action.    Inevitably, there would be the police blotter and the court records, all a matter of public information. Would most people put together that he was a dancer with the ballet company? He was not a principal dancer and, most likely, would not be noticed by most people. This time, it paid off not to be a celebrity, no matter how small.    Corey returned home just as Jeanine was getting ready to leave for work. He tried, unsuccessfully, to avoid her gaze. Shed been watching him lately. He knew she suspected somethingall the coming and going at odd hours, contrary to his fairly regimented rehearsal schedule. She knewsomething. And shed most likely find out when the report was published in the blotter. Then theyd finally have something to talk about. He waved and darted into his house, locking the door behind him.    Here there was nothing but space. Here, there were no walls painted institutional green. Here, there was no one to look at him or judge him or buy him. Here, there was only Corey. Here was a place to reconfigure the pieces, to sort and discard and organize into something new. Something beautiful.

       So, my sister did it...she and Nick are now legit. We saw them married yesterday amongst a small group of family and close friends. It was the first time I was able to meet his family...and just in time, really. I awoke today to the news of Nick's father's passing in the middle of the night. Obviously, the family is in so much emotional turmoil...between the heights of celebration to the deepest depths of grief. I haven't spoken to either Jen or Nick today, but I feel just awful for them both. Please send them all the prayers and good thoughts you can during this difficult time.

       Weddings are fun.  Really.  My sister did it right: she announced she was getting married about a week and a half ago...and the big day is tomorrow. After the initial shock that there was no time to plan anything, it slowly dawned on us in a positive light that  there was no time to plan anything.  Suddenly, there was nothing to get all bent out of shape about. The wedding would happen and fast! There is no time to bicker over anything...and by the time anyone gets worked-up over anything...the wedding will be a pleasant memory. So, I say,  way to go, Jen!  See, this keeps the focus on what's important about their union...and keeps the focus off of caterers, flowers and The Electric Slide.

       Point of note:   -do not light candles on the same table on which you plan to wrap gifts.  -do not panic when you lose control of your car in a horrific holiday snowstorm...ride it out like you're skiing.  -do not try to fake excitement at receiving the world's most hellacious gift from a well-meaning friend or relative (how else are they gonna learn?!?).  -do not listen to Christmas carols on Dec. 26. They all sound sugary and out of tune.  -do not laugh at your dog when his license and nametag get stuck in the heating grate over which he was sleeping and he wakes up strangling himself.

       Just sometimes, there is less to say. Back from a few days trip is always good for shaking up the psyche a bit. I'm not sure if it's the travel, the partying, the exhaustion or a combination of all three, but I always feel like I return to a familiar life that doesn't quite feel like the one I left a week earlier. It's kinda like looking through colored cellophane...everything is where it was...it just looks different. A bit unsettling, really.    Has anyone ever figured out why it's so easy to find boyfriends/girlfriends when you go on vacation?   For the first time ever, I managed to finish all of my holiday shopping well in advance of the holidays, and I must admit feeling a certain level of smug satisfaction mixed with the dawning horror that I feel like an adult when I pull crap like that.   One day in the office to catch up of five days of absence. I'm guessing that there will be 250 to 300 emails waiting for me when I open Outlook...pray for me. With any luck, it'll be a barrage of junk email solicitations for Viagra, home loan refinancing and penis enlargement...three things I am currently not interested in...

        missing you, poodle.    Dear Poodle,   I received your xmas update letter today and loved reading all about your travels and such! Life here at good old PSC about the same since we last spoke: busy, crazy and insane. These are three qualities everyone should look for in a workplace.     My dog, Toby, continues to be cute and has honed his skills in the flirtation department, often scoring me loads of phone numbers from both men and women. I love that dog.     I was excited to hear about your trip to Europe and would love to know more if you ever have the time to chat. I've always wanted to go backpacking there!      RIVERDANCE THE SHOW had a very good week here at the State Theatre in November, although, I must confess, it looks very different from the original...and I feel it lost it's electricity.  This is most likely due to the fact that you weren't there...but that's just my humble opinion.     Working on STONES IN HIS POCKETS at the moment and planning my next great adventure (I'm writing, writing, writing for the project development team at HBO). Keep your fingers crossed!     When you have a moment to catch your breath and get caught-up being off tour, give me a jingle and we'll chatter. All my best!    Love,  Todd

        garons endommags (damaged boys)      twenty-nine     ...and then everything else happened      I suppose I should have seen it coming. Everything was as it should have been, Jeanine was finishing the baking and the housekeeping; and for the first time in history, I believe everyone had managed to reply. We were expecting over thirty people for an evening of holiday cheer, something our house needed desperately. Jeanine and I were not quite on the same wavelength anymore, and there was no easy way to remedy the situation. Things were shifting, glacially, toward disintegrationand we both knew it. I wish I could say I saw an easy fix, but I didnt. I wasnt even sure that our marriage, our union was what I desired anymore.     During our college years, it had seemed the natural way of things: Daniel and Jeanine getting married, having a family and living happily ever after. The truth is, Im still not sure its the right decision for anyoneafter all, its never just your decision is it? No, there are always others involved, families, friends and anyone who can muster up an opinion seems to have input. In the end, its a marriage of expectation. And that, my friends, is a marriage built on a foundation of sweet, frothy meringueliable to dissolve at any moment, crumble at the slightest change in temperature. Impenetrable to the gaze, but destined for collapse and consumption.    And what did they know anyway? Yes, they all had opinionsmarry Jeanine; youll be better off with a smart girl like herlook at those childbearing hips. Truth?  I never wanted kids, but it seemed like something we were expected to do. Do you want to know something else? Im sterile. I cant have kids. Its like God himself saying, Daniel, you are a horrible role model and not worthy of procreating.      Jeanine was devastated, of course. But, in my heart, I think she was relieved to find out that it wasnt her fault, it wasnt her failingit was mine. It was something I could never undo or fix. It was permanent failure. Of course, she never said anything like that, but I could see it in her. I could imagine the conversations with her mother describing my genetic inadequacies, my flaws, my defects.     In the end, I suppose I dont really care. All of this is much easier to carry off without baggageminiature versions of ourselves. And why, for Gods sake, would we want to bring more of our miserable selves into the world? That, I could never understand. I think only the happy, successful people should be allowed to reproduceso we dont get a world full of angry, depressed people like us.    Anyway, everything in our charade was going along fine. The invitations were complete, the holiday gifts were purchased and the house was trimmed like Christmas in Vienna. We were expecting guests and family and then, everything else happened.    I saw him outside the window, crying. He was looking at Bradens door like he couldnt believe hed been tossed out the door like so many before him. Id seen him there looking so helpless and fragileso feminine. Something in me justsnapped.     Anyway, is this bothering you? I said to him hello. And I kissed him. And in one instant I knew I needed to be with him. It was so strange because I had never felt that way about anyone else before, not even Jeanine. Isnt that weird? I pushed him up against the garage door and kissed him hard, forcing my tongue into his warm mouthtasting Velamints and cigarettes. It felt like Christmas. Fucking insane, isnt it? Me, kissing some eighteen year old street rat that Braden discarded like the trash he was.    No big deal, even after the motel and all that. Its the first and only time Ive ever done anything like thatI mean, Im not gay, but we had sexand all I could think about was how amazing it felt and how much I hated this stupid piece of white trashand how much I loved that he wanted me.    Anyway, it was like the first trash day after Christmas when everyone throws everything away, right? So, whatever that wasI got it off my chestso I could move onfocus on being a husband to Jeanine, a good employee at work and a respectable member of the church.    And, I think it helped, too. Jeanine and I started screwing like rabbits and I threw myself into overtime at work. I wanted to show them that I wasnt a loser. I even accepted a position as Deacon at church. Now, I dont think about it muchalmost like it didnt happen. Still, there was my lifeand then everything else happened.    Did you hear about those faggots? Yeah, they want all those special rightslike, to get married. Imagine that, fucking up the institution of marriage. Fucking faggots.

       extraordinary, really...  I spent a few precious hours with my best friend from high school. Jennie was my constant companion for the better part of four years, excluding summers, when I had declared that we were only school year friends. I was weird...well, weirder back then. Jennie has lived in the UK for about eight years now, and I get to see her infrequently. Today, we roamed through the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum here in Cleveland. It's gotten a lot better since I first toured it several years ago. It was significant to me because Jennie and I spent a lot of time working in the radio business during high school, and a lot of our personal history now adorns the walls of the Rock Hall. Spending the time together was like peeling back an onion, until we stood there like we were somehow sixteen. Jennie's completely unique and intriguing effect on me is almost indescribable...you'd have to experience it to know what I'm talking about...but we envelop each other so completely, it's as if there was no one else on the planet. She's going to travel a bit here in the States and then end up back here in late December. We have a date to spend more time when she's back.  I can't wait!

       God, it's been way weird 'round here lately...all trippy and busy. With Jim's departure, we're all catching the slack. Plus, we're putting THE LION KING on sale in a few days, which is more work than you might have thought. In the midst of all of this, I've been promoting a wildly successful run of  urlLink Sing-A-Long Sound of Music  which is a trip and a half. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and go! It's a cross between Halloween and the Rocky Horror Picture Show with a few beloved showtunes tossed in for good measure. Truly a riot! I had the pleasure of spending Tuesday with Charmian Carr, star of the original film (she was Liesl, the eldest...16 going on 17). She was worth the 20 hour day I had!

       Anyhow. I'll suffice it to say that it's been a trying week. There's been all sorts or organizational upheaval around here, and things are starting to settle. My boss resigned and vacated the premises on Wednesday, and we've all been floating in limbo for a few days. It's not starting to feel normal yet, but maybe sometime next week. I got all kinds of off schedule with my routine this week, which has me feeling a wee bit out of sorts. My writing's been delayed, workouts rescheduled and life is just one big, fun question mark.

       Howdy!  I was trying to explain websites and blogging to my 95 year old grandmother last evening.  Her head exploded . She kept saying, "Why would anyone want to do that?!" and "What do you get out of it?!" Nothing like being put on the defensive by granny. The notion is so inconceivable to her that she just had to plain give up on thinking about it. I suppose, though, she'd be able to better grasp the concept if she would actually get  on  the internet at some point. Trying to explain data suspended in the ether is very difficult...and nearly impossible to understand. Anyway...I'll keep working on her.

       That Monday. You remember. It was snowy and cold. People were freaking out about how stormy it was. All I could think about was how I was going to have to get out and shovel my entire walk, front and side porches, and make some sort of attempt to clean the city-owned sidewalk in front of my house. I lucked out, as the snow was light and I made short work of it. As I was finishing up, Jon stopped over. It was the first time Id seen him in over a year, and even though he was bundled beneath all of those winter clothes, that same warmth radiated through all those layers. It reminded me why I had fallen in love with him all those years ago, and in just one instant, it all came crashing back to me. And then I remembered, I had fallen in love with the person I wanted him to be. In that one moment, I was back there, three years ago and infatuated. At once, I felt silly and ridiculous, like an awkward seventh grader. He said it was good to see me, but all of that seemed to be happening in slow motion, like I was detached from the conversation and watching it from five feet away. When I managed to return to myself, we were talking about our jobs, his recent MBA and our families. Before he turned back and walked across the street, he said it was good to see me and that he hoped to see me again soon. I smiled and agreed, knowing it might be months before I spoke to him again. As I walked back toward my side porch, I thought only of that summer, waiting and hoping with unrealistic expectation that I might be delivered, once and for all, from seventh grade.

       Howdy!  Last night, I tried explaining the internet and weblogging to my 95 year-old grandmother.  Her head exploded.  The notion of the internet was so enormous, so vast, that it was nearly impossible to get her to wrap her mind around the concept. When we talked about blogging, she said, "Why on earth would anyone want to do that?!" and "But, what do the people who visit the site get out of it?" Hmm. I told her that absolutely all bloggers are egomaniacal and that all of our collective readers are dirty voyeurs. That seemed to click with her. She said, "Well, I wouldn't do it." I said, "Yes, you would." She said, "No." I said, "Yes." She smacked the side of my head and we were effectively finished with the discussion. But, I now have no greater wish than to bring you  GrannyBlog , the innermost thoughts of a 95 year old ex-flapper girl. I guess I'll have to keep working on that one.

       We here at unextraordinary.com are starting a brand new project which we have been calling, in all of our research and development meetings,    Romancing the Steve  . It's an investigation of the dating habits of a wide range of men across the spectrum of sexual orientation. We began wondering why all of our fabulous female friends were single...and then we started wondering why  we  we still single, and decided to do a little digging. Just why is there wide-spread singledom? Why are perfectly perfect guys going undated? Whose fault is it? Why should we succumb to the pressures of coupling? Why won't that total hottie just go ahead and ask me out already?    We are in the preliminary stages of our research and writing, but we're looking forward to publishing our first profile soon. If you're a dude and think you're "normal" and would like to be profiled in our series of articles, please contact us via  urlLink email . Who knows, we might get you a date...   We here at the unextraordinary.com research labs will bring you quality data, indices and results galore...complete with easy to understand charts and graphs, so stay tuned!!

        river   The photograph  imperfect though our smiles were as we boarded that raft and set sail into the Nantahala with rapids to be forded and miles to discover from backwards to future tense, dreams and disappointments swallowed in eddies lapping at our prickled flesh  we overturned in the smooth quiet waters above silky unseen boulders, feet touching, slipping from moss and slime redirecting our course toward some swirling angry pool begging us forward we clutch and claw the rubber hauling ourselves over and inward heaving our water weight aboard back just above the thin slice of boat, resting and breathing laughing at our own soggy misfortune, waiting for another turn dizzy and silly  some of those hours floated by green and gray beguiled, we watched the shore slip past in an endless ribbon silky and raw and it was unreachable and unstoppable as we gurgled past our own present an odd circus we watched from the river, an audience rushing downstream in the weight of the water sifting us and sorting us through rocks and channels; bobbing up and licking the sky; sinking with us toward rounded pebbles and gravel bottom  there is no end, only departure from Nantahala and we wave goodbye with paddle and knapsack, with scraped knees and chipped teeth wading in the calm toward the flat, toward the dusty and the dry watching as we pass, knowing we will never again return

        exploding chocolate milk.   weird story...  Right. So, there I was just innocently tapping out an email on my laptop when all of a sudden, my half-consumed glass of chocolate milk  explodes . Now, I had poured it over twenty minutes earlier, and it had been sitting right there on the desk the whole time. Why would it just explode like that?!         function VoteWindow() { url="http://vote.sparklit.com/wait.html"; options="toolbar=no,scrollbars=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,"; options+="resizable=yes,width=469,height=430"; window.open(url,"pollwindow", options); } // -->                   Exploding Chocolate Milk          What caused the explosion??        High radio frequencies in and around laptop & transformer   Ghosts, definitely ghosts!   The milk was just too damned cold, Todd!   Freakin' cheapo TJ Maxx kitchenware...totally!

I don't offer tutelage in kissing anymore...the seminar has been defunct for a year or so.

       Todds Rambling Journal-like Thoughts on SLC      Saturday  Flight from ClevelandI arrive bleary-eyed and late for the days races. Checked into the Homewood (not Homestead) Suites  whoops! Grabbed the nearest taxi and shot off to the Olympic Oval in Kearns, Utah. I was greeted by Noelle outside of the building, and it was the first time wed had the opportunity to meet in person. Everyone keeps asking me what it was like to meet Noelle after a whole year, but it was delightfully uneventful, which is to say, as natural and comfortable as could be. The person I met was exactly the person I expected. Of course, it was momentous for me to finally meet my Ohno Zone significant other... she was as intelligent and sweet as I had imagined, immediately disarming and looking quite like she just walked off the set of a Dove Soap commercial.       I was overwhelmed just being there. Having the opportunity to watch Short Track live and in person was so exciting, and to do it with so many wonderful fans was a total bonus! I couldnt believe how many Zoners were there cheering on Team USA and speedskating, in general. It was the first time that it dawned on me just how enormous the Ohno Zone had becomea fact that would become more and more evident as the weekend progressed.        Having arrived in time only for the relay, I managed to get the lay of the land, maneuvering around the Media area and meeting lots of enthusiastic fans. Without any sort of mental preparation, Noelle managed to introduce me to Stephen Gough, Yuki and Apolo. Imagine me (one year later and feeling a wee bit ridiculous) face to face with Apolo and Yuki and hoping to god they didnt think I was some freaky, bizarre, over-the-top fan who, at the age of 31, should be well beyond antics like setting up fan websites. I probably was feeling a little self-conscious. NoI definitely was. Sometimes, even though you know its going to happen, you just cant believe it actually will. And, there I wasright there with Apolo, Yuki, Noelle and Stephenmy head almost exploded. If I wasnt so wickedly exhausted, I probably would have had a stroke. Alas, my cooler head prevailed (because the rest of me was asleep). Everyone was extremely polite, but it was evident to me from the beginning that Noelle was the real celebrity hereknown and loved by allI was feeling quite lucky to just stand next to her. Hi, umIm with her     That evening, I was graciously invited to attend the Olympic Anniversary party at Rice-Eccles Stadium, home of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 2002 Salt Lake Winter Olympics. It was at this party where I had the chance to meet so many Ohno Zoners. This is the part where I start to get all mushy Imagine setting up this website and never really knowing what would or could happen. Yet, here were all of the people who Id know online for a yearand, do you know what? I couldnt have dreamed of a nicer, better bunch of people. I remain completely impressed and quite entertained. Some of yall are hilarious! I cannot tell you how incredible it was to meet everyone, and I was completely overwhelmed with the warmth and love everyone showed me. Suffice it to say, all the Zoners made me feel like a million bucks that night! I felt like I won the gold medal!    Sunday   This is what Im talking about! A whole day at the Oval watching short track!! Does it get any better than this?!? I loved seeing all the hyped-up fans supporting not only Team USA, but all of the wonderful teams in attendance.         If youve never seen it live, theres nothing like it at all! Its exhilarating, exciting and unbelievably entertaining. Some people make the comparison to NASCAR, but I think its WAY more interesting than thatNASCAR drivers at least have a whole car around them when they crashnot so when youre zooming around the ice. Speaking of crashes, Noelle and I were witness to one spectacular crash involving Juffermans from Netherlands and our own Derek Grey. The impact occurred right under Noelles nose which was both a bit of a shock and oddly thrilling. It looked like Derek had been cross-tracked, but got the DQ anyway. Check out my pre-impact shot of Noelle, dutifully snapping pics.         I still cant get over how much fun 5 hours rink side was! I wish I could go to short track events every week! After Sunday, I became more committed to the idea of supporting speedskating as much as I could. Sure, Apolo will always be a focus there, but the more we can do from the Ohno Zone to hook new fans and new audiences, the better off the whole world of speedskating will be!         Of course, Apolo winning the gold in both the 1000m and 3000m was worth both the trek and the lack of sleep! Do you remember what it was like to watch the races during the Olympicswhere you were somewhere between nauseous and drunk?!? You cant imagine seeing it unfold in front of you, live! Noelle was absolutely right, I came to SLC an Apolo fan, and left as a huge fan of short track!        After the days events, I had a chance to spend some more time listening to Apolo give interviews downstairs. He still amazes me with his grace and determination. I dont know many other 20 year olds who have as much poise. I was well aware that both Noelle and I had the honor and responsibility to represent the Ohno Zone in a professional and respectable manner. After all, we were down there with the likes of NBC, The Seattle Times and APwe had a job to do, and Apolo, Yuki and Team USA expected us to do it well.        Highlights, anyone?   + First, and foremost, meeting Noelle in person was one of the most significant events of the SLC weekend and in my own OZ history. Noelle, you know I can never thank you enough for being my partner in thisI love you.    + Meeting the other webmasters was amazing! I loved spending time with the folks who really understand that, no matter how big a labor of love, running these sites is a lot of endless hard work! You inspire me.   + Meeting Apolo, Yuki and the rest of Team USA was, of course, a major highlightand one I shall never forget.   But the most important highlight (and I tell this to anyone who asks) of the weekend was meeting some of the people who make the Ohno Zone such a thriving and wonderful place. To finally see the faceslike meeting long, lost family members, was an experience I cannot put into words. It was, by far, the most profound part of this whole journey.

        Salt Lake City:   Way too much to report right at the moment (I'm too far gone sleepy to do a good job). Suffice it to say, it's been amazing. I have so much to write about & will syndicate my SLC stuff over on Ohno Zone as well. Yes, I got to meet and hang out with everybody. Apolo's a great guy...

       Things:  I often see movies later than everyone else. Typically at 2:30am, I'll catch something I meant to see in the theatres month earlier. I just saw  urlLink The Mothman Prophecies  the other night...and I have to admit that I'm still a wee bit freaked out. I decided to read the non-fiction book the film is based on...and it's pretty freaky, too. Nothing like being creeped out at bedtime. Usually this just happens when I'm in a doomed relationship. Anyway.   One of my dear friends has lost another loved one to suicide. This is one of the most difficult losses someone can have...I know because I've lost two people this way. I wish there was something more I could say or do, but suicide always leaves everyone at a complete loss for words. There never is understanding...always the looming question mark. I knew her friend, and I adored her. While I didn't have much contact with her in the past few years, I will always remember her as a soft spark of happiness...warm and sweet and always moving. She was beautiful and loved.  Namaste , Wendy.   Where do we go from here?    I know my dear friend will weather this storm like she has so many others, but it just doesn't seem fair that she should have to. I know it's all for some higher purpose, but that doesn't create much solace right now. Any good thoughts and prayers would be appreciated.   As for me, I'm remarkably okay! Life and work and play are all at an enjoyable and manageable pace for the moment...and I can be nothing more than thankful.

       A few things...  1. In shock re: Columbia. Way back in 1981, it was this spacecraft that ignited my imagination and fascination with space flight. It also made me realize (early on) that astrophysics would probably not be my major.  2. Kelly's Hagan campaign reunion party was last night...so much fun!!!  3. Lion King's first ad hits tomorrow's paper. The madness begins...  4. I will be flying out to Salt Lake City next Saturday morning to meet up with my Ohno Zone team and other speedskating glitterati.  5. House/Dog sitting out here in the country for my friend Phil.   more later...

        winter wheat    I've been given a tremendous opportunity to revise and revive the one-act thesis I wrote at OSU...the one in which my friend  urlLink Andrew  appeared. I expect that I will be able to improve the dialogue vastly, and add another act...develop the characters appropriately. Still, for what it was...I am still very proud of it. It's a dream to have the chance to breathe life into it once more.   Excerpt:    Kim : What about you?! What about  your  life?   Becky's ghost : There are no answers you'd understand. This isn't about my life. It's about you living  yours .   Kim : I've forgotten how.   Becky's ghost : No. You haven't. This is a new day. This is life. Hold it to your heart and never let it go.     Mrs. DeWine  (flashback):   There is a field across the street from the house where Becky grew up...  a field in which she imagined dreams...where she made memories to last her lifetime and beyond...  A field whithered and dead under the January snow...   The hope and promise of a spring yet to come.  The tiny green chutes burst through the snow, bringing with them new life...   The winter wheat grows...  Through the icy days, it grows...  The green, the life...      Becky's ghost : When the winter comes, and the field across the street turns green...   Remember me.

        weird spring   My yard is an ice rink. Seriously. After the massive thaw yesterday, my lawn was sopped with water, and a 2 inch layer of water puddled over much of it. After the re-freeze last night, I woke to the the sight of Nancy Kerrigan and Brian Boitano rehearsing on my new lawn/pond/rink. If you ask me, they have a lot of work to do before going out with Discover Stars on Ice this season. At least, after what I saw. Granted, they had some issues with the neighborhood Great Dane, but still...

        thoughts.   It's weird. The notion of home is so finite. But there are a few degrees of home, to be sure. The place at 8462 Rockspring Drive is where I spent my first 22 years, so that's home, right? So is the place where my parents live, even though I've only actually lived there for 5 months. Of course, there's the apartment I rented in Columbus, Ohio, on East Frambes, and the one I rented when I moved here to Cleveland in 1995...that one was on Clinton. So, they are all home, in a sense...at least, I feel that way toward those locations. But. There's this place I live now, this house I purchased five years ago...god, I can't believe it's been 5 years, and I was thinking (on my recent jaunt) how much I couldn't wait to get home...and what popped into my head is  this  place. This place from where I am currently rambling on from...not to end a sentence with a preposition...anyway. So, this is home. I sometimes walk through the rooms, looking at everything like it's not mine. Somehow, it's all still strange and wondrous and new. And, I'm here and it's snowing outside and I'm warm and safe and happy with most everything. It's good to be home.

        that's sooooooo gay.    So, after seeing Greta's show this past weekend, I learned that she and her cohorts perform weekly at  urlLink The Grid . Every Wednesday, they do a cabaret/piano-bar type of show. Apparently they rehearse and perform a new show weekly! I am going to go check them out tonight...if you are interested, they do their sets at 6pm and 7:30pm. I'll be there enjoying the discounted cocktails and free tacos! Woo-Hoo!!! So, please join me tonight if you wanna! I'd love to see you!

         come and knock on our door...      Okay, so I've been a little quiet this week, but it's been a bit draining. What with all those interviews, a show opening and tons of stuff to do at home...it barely seemed like 7 days. I like when the week flies by...I do. So, a couple of things to list:   - My friend Greta's show premiered spectacularly in Cleveland this weekend!  Those Seven Little Words: I Love You, So You're Probably Gay  opened at Cleveland Public Theatre to packed houses. Greta developed the show during her time in NYC, and recounts her many tales of romantic dead-ending with guys who end up, well,  gay.  She was backed-up by Drew Rothman on drums, Charles Eversole on keyboard (and Musical Director), Mike Caraffi and Eric Unhold on vocals. I really hope the show can find a great weekly following at a wonderful small venue. If we are all lucky enough to have the show produced here again, promise me you'll go!   - Kelly's been hard at work organizing her world. She gets the award for hardest worker, that's for sure. She may be heading out west to seek her fortune and happiness there, and if there's anyone who can do it, it's Kelly. She's got this amazing ability to keep moving forward, no matter how challenging things get. Anyway, change can be really exciting, so I'm hoping she's all out there and settled by next March...so I have somewhere to stay when I go to the Oscars. Then, she'll be a part of a very important cadre of friends I have out there. Maybe I'll have to move, too. I'm having visions of Venice Beach and reruns of  Three's Company.    - One more quick note. I managed to locate a college friend this week.  urlLink Chris  was my freshman year roommate, and one of the most talented and humorous people I knew at OSU. We have yet to catch up on the phone, but I am looking forward to covering the ten or so years between us.   - Along with hiking and biking this season, I've added running to my outdoor repertoire. It's painful. My high school cross-country days all come flooding back. My muscles don't recover as fast as they once did. I can't run the distances I used to...not even close. But, I will persevere. There is nothing quite like the endorphine rush when I'm done. In the end, it's a great stress reducer and another great reason to be outside!!    Well, I'm off into the wild outdoors. Catch you back here soon...

        Broadway baseball play hits home     It's always puzzling (and slightly disturbing) how straight guys love to put on tight uniforms for each other and parade themselves out in public, swatting each other's asses, grabbing their own crotches and spitting -- all for the love of ... sports. Not that I'm one to complain. That gooey-yet-musky feeling of male bonding and camaraderie you get when you watch a play about sports heroes is strangely missing in "Take Me Out," which recently made its upwardly mobile move from off-Broadway to the Great White Way.  urlLink Full story click here

        Be all that you can be...just don't be  out ...      U.S. Army dismisses more gay linguists   David Ryan Alexander, Gay.com / PlanetOut.com Network    With 15 recent discharges, the Army continues to dismiss gay and lesbian linguists from the military, bringing the total to 24, with a majority trained in Arabic and Korean. "Our nation faces a serious shortfall in the number of trained professionals who can speak and decipher the languages critical to our national security," said C. Dixon Osburn, executive director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN). "The continued firing of lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans who are trained in those languages underscores the detriment of 'don't ask, don't tell' on our nation."    Cathy Glover, an Arabic linguist, was discharged from duty three weeks ago. In response to the nine linguists discharged last fall, Glover had written a letter to the local Monterey Herald newspaper, in which she revealed her sexual orientation. Soon afterward she was dismissed.     "During this war," she said, "the military is more reluctant to discharge homosexuals then they are in peace time, and this is a double-standard that doesn't make sense -- they say we need you during this war, but as soon as this war is over we're going to discharge you."     An editorial in the Washington Post on Wednesday called the practice of discharging gays and lesbians, "self-destructive and unjust. The military cannot afford to brand as unfit for service qualified men and women who wish to put their talents -- whether those lie in combat roles or languages -- in the service of their country." --------------------------  OK,  are we homos like Kryptonite to the US Armed Services?!? Explain to my how you can bolt fearlessly into enemy territory, risking life and limb, and still be so petrified of us? Are straight men terrified that we might employ their own tactics of seduction for use on them? That's clever. Wanna take down the whole US Army? Route your local Pride Parade into a military base...

        as I was saying...     It's been rough these past few days. Not that spewing out personal details seems to help any, which is why I'm not. I am enjoying the conference and my friends here. Anyway, I guess it's just a low moment. I am prone to the cycles. It will soon pass. God knows I've been down this road before. Tomorrow, I will finish up the conference and head up to L.A. Visiting David, Mark and Deidra will be wonderful, and just what I need.

          live from Costa Mesa       I made it out to Cali in one piece, and no worse for the wear. My direct flight from Cleveland was actually about 15 minutes early. I was jonesing from the lack of coffee - I don't like drinking coffee before and during long flights - and so my first stop was for a small cup of joe to ward of my looming and predictable travel headache. I always seem to get headaches while traveling. I used to think it was because of dehydration or something, but it matters not if I drink lots of water...within ten minutes of landing, I'm sprouting what can sometimes be a very nasty migraine.    I have to admit that it was nice to step outside the terminal and see sunshine, green and palm trees. It has this automatic calming effect. I didn't see much, if any, of L.A. today, as I was immediately whisked off to Costa Mesa to prepare for the conference. I've walked around the "compound" here...it's gorgeous. The hotel is built adjacent to a lagoon/lake around which there are restaurants, condos, apartments, etc. There is a wonderful winding pathway that meanders in a large loop around the lagoon and other properties here. I am sitting here at the desk in my room with the patio sliding doors open and a lovely evening breeze wafting through the curtains.    Tomorrow, we begin the conference in earnest. It will be so good to see some of my favorite colleagues from around the country. So, there is positivity. I no longer feel that, er, doom I mentioned on Monday. Suffice it to say, there's a lot going on right now that I haven't mentioned here. I thought I'd do an experiment and see what it was like to not spill the beans about everything. Anyhow, things are looking up, kids! Special thanks to my friends for always listening and for always being there. Kelly, I can't thank you enough, baby!     Well, since I'm in beautiful California, I'm off to go find some guys...I mean, take in the scenery.    Ciao!

        travel sick.    So, I am getting ready to leave for L.A. on Wednesday. All I can say is that I'm leaving feeling like there are more than one or two strands undone...things incomplete. I hate that. I have projects at work to shepherd through...things to organize at home and this overall sinking feeling. Typical. I chalk it up to travel anxiety...not fear of travel, but a consciousness of the stresses involved when moving your life back and forth over a period of days and locations. All I can do is brush it off. Once I'm actually in Cali, I'll feel like I can manage all that's left to be managed in Cleveland. But, when I travel for work, it seems things get effed-up more easily. Ads get misplaced, or worse, don't run at all. Articles get bumped from the Sunday Arts section to oblivion and someone somewhere along the way has a complete and utter meltdown because I'm not where I usually am. This, combined with the fact that I will have over 300 emails to deal with, makes me nauseous about work travel. I know,  doom, doom, doom!  But, truthfully, that's what happens, consistently. So, am I excited to go to L.A.? No. But I am excited to see my friends and spend some quality time, even knowing what'll be waiting for me upon my return. I am not feeling terribly grounded at the moment, so we're talking emotional   magnification  , baby!   I'll be alright. Check me in like, a week.

        Take me home.   Did you ever have about half the weekend you'd expected? I don't mean cut short...more like cut short on expectation and return. I had one of those weekends. I have to remind myself to not collapse myself into desired outcomes...you set yourself up for disappointment almost every time. But, shouldn't we have high expectations for ourselves and others?   I've been doing some minor organizing this weekend...straightening up and such, and I've come across a fairly hideous collection of music from my high school and college days. Some of this may be forgiven in light of the fact that I was a budding homosexual at seventeen. I had not really developed a sense of style or taste. Some would argue that I still haven't (You know who you are...and you can shut up this very instant!). Besides my breathtaking early collection of musical theatre recordings, I found Technotronic, SNAP! and MARRS. Ugh. What was I thinking? Do you suppose I could get anything for them on Ebay?!?

        My horoscope...dead on!     This is a good day to do some grounding activities, Todd. You could feel drawn to spend time outdoors. It would be good for you to connect with Mother Nature right now. You'll feel relaxed if you can go for a long hike or a stroll around the neighborhood. Don't keep yourself locked inside when the Earth is calling to you! If you like to garden, today could be the perfect time to do some planting, mowing, or weeding. You might feel a conflict between your public persona and the private you. If you are usually very outgoing, you might feel tired of acting this way. Don't allow yourself to be pressured into performing all of the time. If you're usually the center of attention, it might be best to stand off to the side. With Mercury sextile Uranus, you need some time to be introspective. Try to gather your thoughts.

        Nashville defeats gay rights bill     A three-month fight over a proposed antidiscrimination ordinance in Nashville ended Tuesday with a narrow defeat of the measure. Vice mayor Howard Gentry cast the tie-breaking vote to kill the proposal after the metropolitan council deadlocked 18-18. The ordinance would have protected gay and lesbian employees of the metropolitan government. The proposal had drawn heavy opposition from conservative religious groups, including the Southern Baptist Convention, which had threatened to move its 2005 national meeting from Nashville if the ordinance passed. "The community has been blessed tonight by the action," the Reverend Paul Durham, pastor of Radnor Baptist Church, said after the vote.    Supporters had amended the ordinance in hopes of gaining approval, changing it to apply only to metropolitan government employees. An earlier version would have protected gays in the private sector in Davidson County. "The council has sent a message to gay and lesbian employees that they are not willing to recognize gays and lesbians as citizens," said Rhonda White, a resident who urged the ordinance's passage. But Gentry said the ordinance wasn't needed. "In my research I have not determined that there have been adequate number of complaints...to justify passing a law when discrimination hasn't been proven in metro government," he said.

Hmmm ...     urlLink  'Don't ask, don't tell' discharges decrease      via Gay.com   According to a report released on Tuesday, the number of gay and lesbian personnel discharged from the U.S. military last year dropped to the lowest level since 1996, suggesting that commanders may have eased enforcement of "don't ask, don't tell" in preparation for war with Iraq.

        updates   If you're a regular visitor to this site, I apologize for the sporadic posting. Life in the analog world has kept me quite busy as of late. Work continues to be completely challenging in every facet. Non-work life of late has run the gamut. I've been able to  urlLink spend some quality time in my beloved outdoors...albeit swampy . I am eager to hit the trails on my new bike and give it a real breaking-in. I keep looking forward to the warm days ahead when I might be able to do some serious hiking. Somewhere in the back of my head, the Appalachian Trail is always beckoning. I keep thinking how awesome it would be if all of us working swells had 6-8 weeks of vacation we could take every year. Anyway.    This past weekend started with a tour performance of  The Sissy Show  at Slippery Rock University in Pennsylvania. After a grueling trip back and forth, I spent the remainder of the weekend with Trish, who was in visiting from Philly. We had lunch with our friend Phil, and a relaxing evening with Wyatt at the Market Avenue Wine Bar. But the real reason she came in for the visit was to see Bon Jovi at the arena last night. I have to admit, it was a terrific show!   So, right. I'm heading back to work now, but wanted to peek out and say hello. Have a good one...

        Landslide.     I love flying on days like today. There is nothing in the sky but clear blue, and the sun illuminates the landscape for miles. Today, we were treated to a Northeastern take-off, which put us way out over beautiful Lake Erie. On cloudless, sunny days like today, Erie is as jewel toned and gorgeous as the waters of Cozumel. When I was just a child, I used to daydream about crossing Lake Erie on a canoe, never really understanding just how long that might take. From Cleveland, it is only 78 miles to the other side, and even at 29,000 feet, you still cant see Canada.     It seems odd to be leaving at such an odd juncture. Grandma is slowly recuperating in the hospital. After two or three cases of acute pneumonia and various other maladies, this 96 year old war horse is ready, I think, to come home. Yesterday marked two weeks at Metro General for her.     I found out on Friday that I will not be promoted to the Director of Marketing and Communications at work. I wasnt really surprised, but definitely feeling a bit rejected. In reality, it means I can focus on new and exciting projects coming down the lineand hey, Ill probably find even more of those. Still, its never easy to be passed up for someone else. Like in human relationships, we are left asking, whats wrong with me? Nothing reallythe answer is much more complicated and vague.    I suppose this is one of those watershed moments where you stop and take stock while youre standing here stuck on the steps of the palace. I think this trip to NYC will be more fruitful and beneficial in so many ways, if not to repair my bruised self-esteem. This years watershed moment times nicely with my birthday, tomorrow, May 20. Last year, I spent time on my birthday in NYC visiting the WTC site and enjoying the company of a few of my friends, whom I only see on my travels to their wonderful city. This year, Ill be in meetings and lunches and cocktail parties, Broadway shows, after-parties and dinners. Ill think about how lucky I am to be so fortunate. Ill be happy to have made it to 32, no worse for the wear. Ill remember my friend Bob who passed away a year ago this Wednesday.     Sometimes its the change in perspective thats needed. From 29,000 feet, things look better already.

        Blogstalker     This time, I actually get to meet my dear, sweet friend Charlie. Weve known each other for a little more than two years. Hes been a bright spot in my life since I met him though weblogging. See, weve actually never met face to face. Sure, weve talked on the phone, emailed, and instant messaged, but weve never been in the same room. Two years ago, I deferred meeting him, as we had only been reading each others weblogs and, well, he does have the name stalker in the title of his blog. I had visions of being locked in a shady one room apartment while being forced to read old stagebill bios. As it happens, Charlie turned out to be one of the sweetest, most lovely people in all of Manhattan. He then promptly moved to New Orleans. Now, hes back in NYC and I cant wait to actually see him. Last year, I had the pleasure of meeting my weblogging friend, Jeff (late of Verdezza fame) and this year, Charlie will be my personal birthday gift.

       To say that I am exhausted would be an understatement. But, here I am...back at my desk, dutifully plowing through the piles of work. I had a really interesting day at the hospital, and I am looking forward to having a moment to describe it to you. Grandma is still hanging in there..I think she's bored more than anything else.    Phil and a couple of other friends are in the process of auditioning for  Joseph/Dreamcoat , which would make for a fun summer experience. Although, I have to admit, at the moment I'm not feeling too much like it at all. We'll see how I feel later on...   I am committed to bringing Greta's show  Those Seven Little Words  to the stage at Playhouse Square. When we get this thing up on its feet, I hope you'll all come and spend lots of money on tickets, drinks and show-related merchandise! I'm going to be rich, I tell you! Filthy, stinking RICH! Oops, was that my outside voice?! Sorry...   Look for more details here very shortly!!

        wandering near the end of the road...    I woke up today to news of my grandmother's hospitalization overnight. She's going on 96 and remains my favorite person on the planet. She's doing much better, but today was tough on both of us. She's in a hospital just down the street from me, so I was able to spend the entire day and evening with her. I witnessed an amazing change in her over the course of my visit. I walked into her room just before noon, and was confronted with a terrified and pale woman not sure she would live to see sunset. She was frightened and alone...and my heart broke into a million pieces. The only part I could fix was to ease her fear and to just be there...so at least she wasn't alone while waiting to find out what was wrong with her. It turns out that she had a bit of pneumonia which caused an irregularity in her heartbeat. It caused her heart to race, while at the same time decreasing her oxygen levels. So, once the docs explained that her heart wasn't damaged or failing, you could almost see her reinflate. They are treating the pneumonia and observing her for a couple of days. I had a really amazing day with her and was so thankful I could be there when she really needed me. I left the hospital and immediately fell to pieces on my drive home. I was at once exhausted, joyful and terrified. As a rational human being, I know she's 95 and can't live forever. As her grandson, I can't bear to see her in pain or terrified or sad. But I do know that I can only be present...in the moment with her. I can take away the lonliness. I can ease her fear. I can love her, as I always do, completely, every day. In return, she does the same for me...as she has for over thirty years.   And we find our way through this place...together.

        it sprawls out before us    I can't believe how gorgeous it is outside at the moment. I am slamming this entry out before I dash out to spend the balance of the day on the trails. Toby and I are heading out into the wilderness to hike, and we won't be back til sundown. Funny things happen when we go out hiking. Sometimes it's Zen-like, sometimes it's like food poisoning...either way, we're out of the house.

        it's not like you asked for a list    There is something to be said for domesticity! Last evening, I stopped at the market for a few groceries. When I arrived at home, I helped my friend Margaret with some of the decision-making about the landscaping going on in my yard. Perhaps "landscaping' is too strong a term, but she is cleaning, planting and shaping my whole yard and so far, it's looking brilliant! While she was doing that, I busied myself in the kitchen preparing a quick, summery dinner of fresh salad, guacamole and turkey burgers. We watched bad cable television for the remainder of the evening and were treated to an amazing show of thunder and lightning. Somehow it was a nice balance to the bar-hopping shenanigans of late.

        updates.    The Lion King had its first performance last night. It looks like everything went off without a hitch. I ran into an old friend from high school while in the lobby last night. Since I went to a smallish school, I tend not to see people very often. I always find myself unexpectedly thrilled to see them. Not that I had a bad time of it in high school, but I never thought that many of the people there had much use for me. No one was ever mean or nasty. No one ever gay bashed me. But, I never had a strong sense of connection. Running into Mickey last night was so much fun...even just to say hello. It gave me hope that maybe we're all just a little older, wiser and nicer. I know...oh look at Todd wax nostalgic...he never does that. All I can say is that is was wonderful running into someone so intertwined with my past. Mickey and I went to school together from K thru 12. Maybe there will be the chance to keep in touch. Who knows.

        urlLink  .      For those of us who live here, and for those of us who were raised in this great city...the time is now to take action! We have lived with our pervasive and stifling citywide low self-esteem for too long. The time is now to wrench away the slow, plodding, backwards conservatism that is clotting the arteries of this city's cultural and economic cardiovascular system. Are we a city of gray-haired ex-banking executives and sports team owners? Are we a city of doomsayers content to watch opportunity after opportunity slip away to other regions, states and countries?    Let me ask you this:  what have YOU done to help revitalize our home, our city, our Cleveland?  Unless you are proactively seeking solutions, you may as well be a part of the brain-drain. Go ahead and move somewhere else...the rest of us don't have the time or energy to combat your negativism and doubt. Those of us who believe we can move this city forward must focus every bit of energy toward that goal. In the coming weeks and months, we must seize every opportunity to support Cleveland...in every decision large and small. We must keep industry, culture and housing both viable and attractive options. We have an overwhelming wealth of underutilized talent and capacity. We must keep work in our city. We must develop and create and support. We must be heard. Write something. Say something. But more than that,  do something .

        moving day    Very good news! Grandma is leaving the hospital today, transferring over to an assisting-living/rehab clinic for another week or so of therapy. I am so happy for her...she's been at Metro for almost 6 weeks. Progress does not come quickly for a 95 year old woman, but to her credit, she meets every challenge with tenacity and spirit. She still has a long road ahead, but she is healthy enough to be released from the hospital...and it's a relief for all of my family.

        A gay soiree...    Its not like the words gay and Tony awards never appear together, but this years kudofest was particularly homo heavy. The gay festivities started off with a nationally televised kiss between  Scott Wittman  and  Marc Shaiman , partners in both love and songwriting, who won the award for Best Original Score for Hairspray. We are not allowed to get married in this world, I dont know why, but Id like to declare in front of a million people, I love you, and Id like to live with you for the rest of my life, said Shaiman. Shortly afterward,  Joe Mantello  thanked his boyfriend, playwright  Jon Robin Baitz , when he accepted the award for Best Director for his work on Take Me Out. Then  Denis OHare  thanked his boyfriend as he accepted the award for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his performance in Take Me Out, which won Best Play for openly gay dramatist  Richard Greenberg . (The play itself is the story of a baseball player who comes out of the closet and features more unclothed men onstage than Naked Boys Singing.) Hairspray won eight prizes, including Best Musical. Any play with  Harvey Fierstein  (in or out of a dress) qualifies as gay, but the Tonys recognized several members of one of the queerest creative teams ever to mount a musical: in addition to Shaiman and Wittman, there are director  Jack OBrien , book cowriter  Mark ODonnell , and costumer  William Ivey Long . (Other gay men in the wings include  John Waters , who wrote and directed the original film, and choreographer  Jerry Mitchell .) The play, which tells the story of a pudgy teenager named Tracy Turnblad who integrates a TV dance show back in 1962, is about inclusiveness, as ODonnell said last year when the team was honored in the 2002 Out 100. The outsider-becomes-insider story was made even sweeter when  Marissa Jaret Winokur , who won Best Actress in a Musical, proclaimed, If a 4-foot-11, chubby New York girl can be a leading lady in a Broadway show and win a Tony, then anything can happen.

        Birds in my window.     Sometimes you just stop. Ever been stuck in your own personal quicksand? According to the clinicians, I am depressed, well at risk anyway. They say this because I checked a few too many of the options on the diagnostic exam. And, do you know, I think they might be right. I think we under-diagnose the condition. I didnt really think about it as a possibility until, after two weeks of not feeling like myself, I realized I didnt know how to get back. But, the one thing I did know was how it all happened. I looked at the lineup of stressors in my life and heard the bell go offhow could I have missed it?!? Why is it that we push ourselves to be perfect and happy all the time, and then, conveniently, pretend not to notice when things go south? So, what do you do? For me, the answer was to make proactive choices about my mental and emotional health. Instead of standing still, I choose a direction. For me, where there is motion, there is hope. Where there is motion, balance may return.    I have this daily reminder of the continuity and simplicity of life. A pair of sparrows has built a nest within the wall of my house near one of my bedroom windows. During the fierce winds and storms of this past winter and spring, one of the wooden siding planks came looseleaving a small triangular holelike a door ajar. Its funny, because I thought of it as a nuisance at first. There is this hole in my house, between the siding and the interior wall. I hear them in the morning, fluttering around that impossibly tiny space. They fly back and forth to the maple tree in the front yard. Sometimes, when I stand at the window in my pajamas, they fly out of the nest and hover in the air, looking at me through the window, no doubt trying to make sense of their curious human neighboreven while I try to make sense of their curious human neighbor.     Things change daily, and today, things are good! Look, I am only sharing this with you because I believe people should talk about it. I am not looking for sympathy, and there is no reason for you to be concerned. Sometimes, it's impossible to be shiny-happy people. And that's okay. It just seems we never hear about hitting bottom, or swamping around in the quagmire. So there.    And...I used both 'quicksand' and 'quagmire' in one entry. Ha!

       These have been some of the most interesting and insightful days in recent memory. God knows I have been thru many, many weeks of pre-production and rehearsals for shows, but they were never shows I was producing, or personally responsible for, financially. I received an amazing education, and I am pleased to say that the investment of time, money and other resources seems to have paid off both figuratively and literally. I am so proud of the show, and my dear friends Greta, Chuck, Mike, Eric and Andrew deserve every accolade, every laugh and every ovation. THey are terrific and I am lucky to be along for the ride. What's more, the really wonderul people of Cleveland (other than the crotchety old critics) seem to have embraced the show, and are voting with their time and with their dollars. Many thanks to everyone who helped promote the show. We've got six performances left, and more if you want 'em!    Grandma is having an incredible few days in hospice. She is comfortable and serene, and pain-free. While it is heartbreaking to witness her final days, there is a sense of joy knowing we have had every opportunity to say what we needed to say, and to hear what we needed to hear. My grandmother and I are particularly close, more so than most, I think. She helped raise me, from just a few weeks old until I was 13, she lived in our house and was a part of my daily life. I know we are in her final days, and the call could come at any moment. Until then, I spend every available minute with her, enjoying her, and celebrating her astounding 96 years.    Does it seem a bit overwhelming? Absolutely. Am I surviving? Yes. Thank you for keeping our family in your thoughts and prayers. I'll speak to you soon, friend.

        People Are Noticing...    Producing a show is an amazing education! There are challenges and triumphs galore on the road to opening night. And, it seems that we've built up some nice momentum. We've drummed up quite a bit of local press, and have even done pieces for TheaterMania.com and will be the lead story on Playbill.com this Friday! Talk about doing something interesting in Cleveland and other people around the country taking notice!    Tonight was our first tech run in the theater space, and I was immediately reminded why I have such faith and praise for this show. Quite simply, it's brilliantly sung, charming and humorous. Even rehearsal was worth paying for. I woulda sold tickets if I could have...   So, getcher tickets now (we only have 100 seats per show) before they're all gone! Wouldn't it be cool if we had to extend?!! Well, let's get thru opening week, first. At any rate...wish us all the best! The critics are coming, the critics are coming!!!

        Sweet Afton   Robert Burns    Flow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes,  Flow gently, I'll sing thee a song in thy praise;   My Mary's asleep by thy murmuring stream,  Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.    Thou stock - dove whose echo resounds thro' the glen,  Ye wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den,  Thou green - crested lapwing, thy screaming forebear,  I charge you disturb not my slumbering fair.    How lofty, sweet Afton, thy neighboring hills,  Far mark'd with the courses of clear winding rills,  There daily I wander as noon rises high  My flocks and my Mary's sweet cot in my eye.    How pleasant thy banks and green valleys below,  Where wild in the woodlands the primroses blow;  There oft as mild Ev'ning weeps over the lea  The sweet scented birk shades my Mary and me.    Thy crystal stream, Afton, how lovely it glides,  And winds by the cot where my Mary resides,  How wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave,  As gathering sweet flow'rets she stems thy clear wave.    Flow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes,  Flow gently, sweet river, the theme of my lays,  My Mary's asleep by thy murmuring stream,  Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.

       God, it's August. Hello from a rather frazzled and over-caffeinated human being. Let's see, to summarize:   1. Work (pre-season, break-neck pace)  2. Hospice (Grandma's still hangin' in there)  3. Rehearsals (A Chorus Line is shaping up)  4. Everything else (overwhelming)   7LW has the week off, so I am having my nephew over for the weekend...a little family bonding time. I'm looking forward to doing normal stuff like seeing movies and playing miniature golf...anything to distract this tweaked-out brain.  ;)

       So, we relaunched our new website at work. Rachel headed-up the project, and I think she did a great job! It's been months of meetings selecting a vendor, then many more months executing phase one. It's still nowhere near where it will be, but it's a vast improvement over what we had, which mercifully, is deep sixed. We're still fixing bugs and broken stuff, but check it out:   urlLink playhousesquare.com

        crack copter   They were buzzing around the city tonight like oversized flies, circling and shining their halcyon search lights. They tend to dart around the airspace in my neighborhood with regularity. Their beams have even swept across my lawn and house, looking for whatever. Every time I see them up there I can't help but wonder what they're doing...my curiosity gets the best of me. Kelly and I started calling them crack copters because we assumed they were looking for drug activity...but who really knows?

        words spoken   Lately, I've been speaking. I was asked to make a toast at Michelle & Eric's wedding last week, and even though I am a veteran public speaker, it still made me nervous. Isn't that weird? My mother would also like for me to say a few words at Grandma's memorial service this Sunday. I think Grandma is now the world-record holder in delayed cremation. Let's see...she passed on August 9, and today is...  Well, the memorial service is the 28th...small private affair. Of course I have a zillion things to say, but when the moment comes, I wonder if it'll be tough. I want to be able to say something sweet and significant to her memory without choking up and becoming a giant mess. I'm sure it's possible...but not probable.  When I was house sitting for my parents this past weekend, I had to mess with their answering machine (I thought I broke it) and found that my mother has saved lots of messages...most of them adorable verbal missives from her 8 year old grandson. I was skipping my way through them and ran across the voice of my second grade teacher, Mrs. Munn, who just passed away this past month. Then, a message or two away was the voice of my grandmother, calling in from the hospital asking how the doctor's appointment went for Marissa and Zachary (two of her great-grandchildren and my niece and nephew). It was simple, but amazing to hear her voice...captured on tape. All at once, it was if she was there in the room. I shut off the answering maching half alarmed and half thankful that Mom had saved it.  They are just words...but they were her words...and they reminded me about her sweet, ever-vigilant and loving concern for all of us. Thanks, Mom, for not deleting that...

        why i write/don't write...   When we all started this, years ago in my case, blogging was, for me, a simple way to write and to keep writing. Blogging was relatively unnoticed, flying under the radar of mainstream  anyone . What I loved was the sense that only people who had similar interests might stumble across the site. I didn't feel the pressure to produce or be "on" or to say anything in particular. As time progressed and more people started to blog and pay attention to blogs, I found it more and more difficult to say the things I wanted to say. Unextraordinary.com has always been a place where I felt safe saying almost anything...it was a place where I felt it was okay to be melancholy, provocative, silly, newsy and everything else. Maybe it still is, but I gotta tell you, it's weird sitting down to write anymore without thinking of the eyes out there reading...and I hate to think I've edited myself because of it. But, things change and I've had to adapt. I think I have been spending a lot of time trying to figure out just what the hell to do with this blog anymore.  Look, this has never really been an issues blog, nor has it delved into politics or anything of that nature. Sure, you have a sense of my leanings and my beliefs, but I refuse to become simply a site made up of other people's content...that's not what drew me to blogging. Sure, there will always be linkers and content-grabbers, as well as blog pundits and observers, that's just not me. I never wanted my blog to resemble anything close to a job, nor did I really want an audience of expectant consumers...I did that for awhile with 'unravel in 58' the ultra-personal look at the rise and fall of a dating relationship via exchanged emails, and also with the 'my big gay life' series. After a few months, I felt the near constant pressure to produce. It became overwhelming. I stopped writing. That's not good because, after all, this site was set up for me, first and foremost.  I know what you're thinking. You think all of us with blogs and websites must be completely egomaniacal, and maybe we are...a little, but I am not doing this to be noticed. I am doing it to participate in the process, to continue workshopping and developing my skill. This is not to tell you to hit the bricks. No. By all means, read away. I can't promise you anything. Nor should I. I can't promise you that I'll be here or that I'll always be honest. Some things gotta stay personal. In the meantime, I'll be off somewhere observing, thinking and having a life (which I do have, actually). Less time in front of a keyboard is good.    Absence makes the heart grow.

        Somewhere Over Florida     I havent really had much time to take stock of whats been going on in my life this summer. Sure, I know Ive been thru lots of major changes. Grandmas passing has been tough on me, of course, but in the midst of all of that, some really wonderful things blossomed. I get going, trying to write stuff down and it all comes out icky, so I delete it, or dont even write it at all. I can hear every last one of my writing teachers and mentors screaming, nooooooo! Theyre always saying that you should just write, no matter how crappy. Anyhow, Im sitting on this flight back from Tampa, sitting next to what appears to be some oversized, overweight football coach from some rinky-dink college or high school. So far hes kept to himself, which is better than the lady sitting next to me flying down here. She apparently was illiterate, and couldnt see that her boarding pass was for the middle seat, not the window seat, which was supposed to be mine. But, she was old and I thought I should respect my elders, especially one with special needs. So, I sat in the middle next to chatty-Cathy from Charleston West Virginia, with her Appalachian accent, and with illiterate Betty on the other side. Soon, they found themselves involved in a discussion togetherright over my airspace. They served us this little rolls with a slice of turkey and wilted lettuce and they had those little bags of baby carrots instead of peanuts, which I thought was very creative. Todays flight, however, I didnt even get my own can of soda, much less a bag of peanuts. The catering standards on these flights vary wildly, apparently.    So, I have a few anxieties about flying into the remnants of Hurricane/Tropical Storm/Tropical Depression Isabel. It looks to have stalled-out over Cleveland, which means a harrowing landing once again into Hopkins Airport. It wont be my last, Im sure. The great thing about attending a conference for about 27 hours total is that you get to dart in and out, do all the fun stuff, and get home before youre miserable, bored, insane or some combination of all three. I helped plan this conference and I was the first to leaveha! However, I have to be back at work tomorrow morning for an open house event we have every year. So, this being the only flight to Cleveland today, I had to be on it.     I will be glad to get home this evening. Ill be able to relax for a bit. I am picking up Jeff and taking him to the airport tomorrow morning. Hes headed out to a work-related conference in New Orleans, which sounds way more fascinating and interesting than what I just attended, but he has to stay down there for five days. Bleh!

        the ohio & erie canal towpath    On Sunday, Jeff and I rode about 30 miles along the Towpath Trail, riding from Valley View down to Peninsula and back. It was an ideal day for biking: cool, sunny and clear. The miles seemed to slip by like water, and we were at the turnaround point in just over an hour. There were no major wildlife sightings this time, but I have seen coyote, deer, quail and lots of other varied animals, birds and the like. However, we did see a lot of people wearing spandex and lycra that shouldn't. Anyway, I usually do my long distance rides alone...so I was thrilled to have company along for the journey.

        My life in fast-forward...    Until this week, it's all been a blur. Rehearsals. Shows. Grandma. Work. Now, I actually have some free time and I'm loving it. It feels almost foreign, but wonderful. It's nice to have no obligation to be anywhere after work. I can just catch up with my friends, nap, go out...it's all there. This weekend I have to help my friend Michelle prepare for her wedding which is next week. It'll be nice to catch up with her before the total chaos of the wedding hits.

        backwards toward new    They take form and devolve, like apparitions, figments I could barely remember. But, like the scent of it, some things we never forget. I remember when you were here, in this life, and we'd run toward the lake and sing as we crumpled under the weight of our own laughter, in the grass. We'd stain our knees and cuffs in verdant hues, the sky our floor...and the meadow, our ceiling. There was no end to it then, an endless train of nights and mornings, hitched together with purpose. We were foolish and reckless then, never anticipating change or death or vanishing or the simple end of it.     Like infinity, you skate an elegant figure eight in and out of me, and the tunnels and burrows have become slick and hardened, letting you pass through without sticking, quite without notice at all.  In one moment, you want my face to flicker recognition or absolution or hate, but I cannot do it. And I look blithely away, toward something...anything else.    No, you are not a part of my reconfiguration. I am constructing the new oasis from sky and grass and laughter. I am a construction of ages old love and memory and bitterroot. There are things I cultivate, and things I discard. There are no questions without answers, and so I move forward, toward everything I fear and everything unknown.     I wasn't that I didn't love you...

        don't feel like you have to perform... just talk  ...   That was one of my lines from the script of  A Chorus Line . We finished up the run  this past weekend. I was sad to see it end, but not for just the usual reasons. No, this time there was more. ACL was the place I went every night this summer while Grandma was in the hospital and in hospice...it was my escape and my relief. Of course I miss my friends from the show, and will continue to see them, but there is always that sense of finality...a parting of ways...like breaking up.   But there are new diversions and relationships to explore and develop, and I am excited about what new things are in store. I remain resolute about returning to blogging. I managed to miss my August 10 Blogaversary...I'm three years old now! I feel like grandpa in a pack of excited/slick up-and-comers...but I am so thrilled to see blogging  finally  take off 'round these parts. There are some amazing Clevebloggers...I would suggest clicking on that Brewed Fresh Daily link to visit a few. Check them out...they're really wonderful, some of them...

       Reruns. A reintroduction to the series...so we can pick up where we left off...   (damaged boys)    twenty-five    pluie dans le nuage   The unit sat empty for four months. The windows remained dark and lifeless, much like they did when Braden lived in those rooms. Everything remained as hed left it. The furnishings and accessories were all there, it was all for sale, and it was better that way. Better to say goodbye to all of the old belongings, the old way of living. He was in a new life now. A life where there was no use for chrome and stainless steel. A life where there was warmth and light. He would not decorate his new home to reflect the month of November.  Braden visited once more to make final arrangements and walked through his former home. He was careful not to switch on the lights or to draw attention to his presence there. He didnt need the neighbors to notice. He didnt need to explain his absence. He didnt want to look into their questioning and judgmental eyes. No, best he should keep quiet and not attract anyones undesired attention. He walked through this place he formerly called home and wondered aloud if anyone had actually ever lived there. It was as if hed barely left an imprint, nothing remotely traceable to him. No evidence that this place was of him, carefully crafted and controlled. In the end, hed designed himself right out of it. There was no proof of life here. If anyone had asked, no one would know that Braden was ever here at all, and all at once he was reminded why he needed this movewhy he needed this total transformation.  As he walked through the living room, he noticed a dark coin on the floor. He examined it: an old penny dropped by one of the prospective buyers, no doubt. It was not his, and if there was luck in a found penny, the luck was not his. He left the copper disc on the floor where hed found it. Someone else needed it, not him. He locked the door behind him and slipped down the block before anyone had noticed he was there at all.  Braden was done with his life in this city. Braden was becoming someone else, someone who liked shades of gray, and shades of satisfaction and maybe even happiness... maybe . Charleston was home now. Charleston had colors and warmth and people stewed in sea and sun. Things smelled of rain in the sunshine and of clean cotton. Things were perfect and exhilarating and undone.  Ben and Marcus noticed it first. They were returning from the gym when the sold placard stared garishly red at them, plastered along the upper length of the For Sale sign.  Corey had seen them in and out of the unit several times recently, the woman and her son. Sandwiched by the straight people, he thought.  Daniel and Jeanine were introduced to the new neighbors by the realtor, Maxine. Jeanine liked them. It would be nice to have another woman in the row of townhouses.  Ellen and her 18 year old son Ryan moved into Bradens old place on Saturday. The large moving trucked pulled up, and within five hours, had completely unloaded the sum total of their lives into their new home.  Ryan liked the sleek interior, the contemporary feel, the sense that he was urbane and special and living in the city. He was eager to start school in the winter quarter, just after the first of the year. Even though hed be living on campus, this would still be an amazing place to call home. It was a far cry from the 19th century farmhouse theyd owned when living in Wallingford. Hed surmised that this was the perfect place in which to start over, and hed wanted that more than anything.  Ryan, your soccer stuff ended up in my room, do you want it in your room or do you want to take it down to the storage room?  Ill take it downstairs. No need for reminders of high school now. All of his championship team memorabilia could be stowed safely away.  Ryan took the large box down the steps into the clean cement-floored storage room just off of the garage. He paused and looked through the box. There were trophies and plaques, soccer patches not sewn onto his varsity jacket, certificates and photos. He looked at the photo of him and his best friend James after their Districts victory. They were both so high on the win, happy to be on the best team, happy to be together. The photo caught them in the middle of laughing, arms casually flung around each other enjoying the moment. Ryan smiled as he switched off the light and took the photo upstairs.  He missed James. But it hadnt been the same since the whole gay thing happened. It had been months since theyd even spoken, but it probably was for the best. In time, maybe, but for now, well, life had to move on. And, for the first time, he didn't cry...there was no more rain in the cloud.

           excerpt from  Where Birds Gather ...   Awake the past three fall mornings lying next to the gently breathing, warm, warm man pale with dreams and sweetened by the naivete morning brings. His arms around me - keeping me from moving - from leaving him. The very sweetness of his soul slips forward with every drowsy breath rendered. Sometimes, when he's deep in sleep, his lips form shapes and he utters garbled, unintelligible sentences...as if he were at once speaking to me in code, and muttering secrets meant not at all for my ears.   When morning blooms and we both stumble ungraciously into consciousness - when reality retaliates for all of the stolen moments, we are thrust into a coldness - bright light silvery and gray. There is no warmth here - no comfort, no embrace. Only quick morning ablutions and a swift retreat to schedules, oxfords and work. But, in those moments when it is still, when it is still darkness and quiet...asleep with him, afloat in the warmth...I memorize this.

        work swampy   I need help getting myself organized at work. I am so swamped, it's crazy! How are you supposed to deal with an average of 100 to 150 legit emails a day, phone calls, meetings, etc.? Where are you supposed to squeeze in the actual work part? I'm starting to think that the benefits of email are directly linked to the drawbacks. We seem to have higher capacity, but at what expense? I hate walking around feeling like every time I open my email box, I'll be buried in an avalanche.  So, today I will focus on work related to three main projects: 1.  urlLink THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE  2.  urlLink CHICAGO  3.  urlLink BROADWAY SEASON CAMPAIGN, Flight 2   If anything arrives in my inbox not related to those three items, will be reprioritized as "later." Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with work swampage?

You're likely to have a lot of energy to pour into creativity right now, dear Taurus, and if you work hard and don't lose sight of the business side of the arts, you could find yourself moving forward. Don't be surprised if you should suddenly meet just the right person to give you just the right advice!

       notes from a windy day...  Up early this morning. More gusting and noise kept me from the sleep. That, and a certain 25 pound Maine Coon who kept pacing and purring. Impossible to sleep. Rose at 4:50am to a dark and blustery morning. Cold too. Freezing. Took a walk down at the lakeshore. Watched waves at 10 feet crash over the breakwall and sand whip up from the dormant beach and fly toward downtown. Returned home to pot of fresh hot coffee, slumbering pooch and the start of the day, just dawning pinkish gray.

There are a million little details to track, tons of ticket requests and lots of television and radio shows to service with guests and promotions.

        My letter to Governor Taft   Dear Governor Taft,   As an intelligent and compassionate human being, I am flummoxed and exasperated at the passage of the "gay marriage" ban. I am disappointed in my fellow Ohioans who are obviously small-minded and bigoted. In a society where single people now outnumber married folk, the special protection of the "institution" of marriage seems inappropriately lopsided. Are we not compassionate enough to offer all citizens of this great state the same opportunities and benefits? How is it that we can legislate discrimination and hate?    I have been extremely vocal on this point and remain completely committed to an Ohio free from discrimination. Protecting the institution of marriage from a non-threat is ridiculous.   I know you have stated you will support this piece of bigoted legislation, and for that, I am extremely disappointed in you as Governor and as a human being.  Respectfully,   Todd R. Stuart

       So proud to be a Buckeye...    Ban on gay marriages clears Ohio Senate    Columbus - A divided Ohio Senate approved a bill banning gay marriage Wednesday after a lengthy debate about religion, civil rights and health insurance benefits for gay couples.   The bill, approved 18-15, declares that same-sex marriages are against the "strong public policy of the state." It would prevent Ohio from recognizing same-sex unions, regardless of where they are per- formed, and it would prevent the state from extending the legal benefits of marriage to unmarried couples.   urlLink Full story

        Rear View Mirror ...  Are we always on the precipice of change? I tend to think so. Change isn't always pretty or convenient, but it's definitely not a bad thing. I think, at times, it is the sole force moving me forward. If you can't move toward change, why move forward at all, right? The status quo is boring at best, and usually suffocating the rest of the time..so we plunge forward.  For me, there were equal parts sorrow and joy this year. I said hello to my niece, Marissa, and from May to August...a very long, devastating goodbye to my grandmother...a woman of incredible depth, intelligence and love.   I said goodbye to my dear friend Kelly, who moved to Providence, and even though she's only a phone call away, it's not like having her around the corner. She will always be a sister and mentor...and I will always long to have her closer.  And, in the darkest, most desolate hours of August, love took root...where now there was room.   It seems I have more clarity now, a gift for surviving and thriving in the past twelve months. More often than not, things did not turn out as I had wished, but the insights received far outweigh what I thought I wanted.  I continue to look inward to affect change on the outside.

        Unscheduled Pick-Up Services  or   Alley Shenanigans    This week, my detatched garage was burgled again. Before you get hugely alarmed, let me explain that I live in an urban area, and my garage sits off an isolated alley where lots of bored teenaged boys seem to congregate and think up plans to gain themselves riches at the expense of the neighbors who are lucky enough to own property that backs up to said alley.  So, my side door was crowbarred open, and my broken-down, piece-of-junk lawnmower was taken. Now, normally, I might be upset. However, since this past summer, I have been meaning to get rid of the lawnmower. The heap of metal and mechanics stopped functioning in late spring. I wasn't sure how one went about throwing out a lawnmower (it was definitely beyond repair). Well, it seems I don't need to worry about it now. Conveniently, it was removed from the premises without cost...well, except for the broken door which I need to fix.  Shortly after I got to my office this morning, I managed to find out that the proper disposal of heap-o-junk lawnmower might have cost me well over $250 in disposal and environmental fees. Hmm. So, you're telling me that if I can repair my door for less than that, the robber teenagers have actually saved me money?  Hmm.  Look, no one likes getting their stuff taken. It sucks. But maybe there really is a silver lining in this cloud. Yeah, I gotta fix the door...and getting that coordinated and paid for will take just as much time as taking the lawnmower to the dump, but at least I don't have to deal with going to the dump and shelling out $250 smackers.  In the meantime, I've moved my skis and a small handful of other minor valuables from the garage (including my car for now) in case the boys get any more bright ideas while I am getting the door replaced.  I have to commend the quick response of the Cleveland Police Department. Officer Jeff Swit was really great, taking down the basic information, encouraging me to install a particular type of door and promising to increase cruisers through the alley on all three shifts. This thirteen year veteran of the Ohio City beat made me feel immediately at ease.  It is so easy to get discouraged when things like this happen, but it makes me redouble my efforts to increase safety and awareness. I love Ohio City...it is my home and I deserve to live here without feeling terrorized and violated.   In the end, there are inherent risks about living in any given place. I chose to live in an urban environment and have never regretted my choice. I love my neighborhood. I also know that I need to remain vigilant, along with my neighbors, and do everything I can to keep my property and the entire community as safe as possible.  Just wanted to share my own tales of the city...

        Where Birds Gather...  Part One:   First Ill Try Love   There was the immediate sense that something was workingand working well. Right off the bat, hed asked me to jump out of a plane with him. Of course, how could he know of my abject terror of rinky-dink planes and my Rain Man-like knowledge of aviation disasters? I was at once appalled and smitten. I was being served-up that one, glimmering opportunity where you meet the person youve been waiting to meet.  Here he was in front of me, not knowing the grueling number of dates Id been on in search of something a little more comfortable, a little more balanced and real. That didnt really matter, of course, but it was his easy manner and charitable warmth that gave him away. This was something different, something valuable. I could see it already, but could not verbalize my observationit was much too soon. There would be time.  The world was slowing down. Like an extended run on The Scrambler at the county fair, life had been whipped into a nauseating froth, a completely dizzying and complex cycle of months and hours that felt like months. Then, as I gradually slowed, my eyes trained on him. I remember him reaching toward me, but I couldnt stop the spinning then. I had to wait. And when it stopped, he was there for me, waiting to introduce himself.  I had seen him earlierbut I hadnt known it was him. He walked out onto the patio of a local bar with two of his softball teammates, and the room stopped. Everyone turned to get a good look. He was amazing, the kind of person who youd figure was way out your league. Besides that, he was probably one of those typical pretty-boys who spent too much time drinking designer vodka and dancing shirtless at those thump-thump dance clubs.  Whoever he was, he would take a back seat to the end-of-life process surrounding the death of my grandmother. There was nothing more important than honoring her life and her memory. There was work to be done on the inside, swollen with grief and sorrow. There would be reflection and a letting go that no one is truly prepared to undertake. I would wallow through all of this, the hard work of this, and he would be there, waiting and not certain how to support, let alone console, this person he hardly knew. And yet, he tried. And that was the miracle of him...and it spoke volumes.  I remember stumbling through the first dates, waiting for him to see the clutchy and hapless me. The one youd want to run away from. The person youd avoid calling, or youd call at home during the work day and safely leave a message saying how you didnt think it would work out. That guy never appeared. Instead, I remained distracted and coolnever worrying about what was going on between us. It allowed us time to breathe, to fit together.  We were already talking when it happened. The time had come in hospice, and Grandma was slipping away. I was consumed with caring for my nephew, trying to make his world as normal as possible, until the inevitable would break-in and change all of that. We shopped for toys, lunched on cheeseburgers and saw a matinee. He helped me pick out new tires for the car, exercising his passion for all things auto.  I was in the middle of a rather ambitious round of Monopoly with my 8 year old mini-mogul land baron when the telephone call came. She had stopped breathing. It was finally at an end. She slowed, quietly and softly into her last breath. I nodded as I processed the news into packets of details to be filed away. We would leave immediately and go to her, to be with the family, and to grieve with my mother who watched my grandmother exhale.   And somewhere between the tears, the abrupt end of Monopoly and consolation of an eight year old boyI too, stopped breathing.  -Todd Stuart

        A Letter from Georg: Accidental Correspondent   Good day, my American friends.  I live just to the north of you in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  In the province of Ontario it is now legal for queers to wed.  We were all shocked when the legislation passed, and there are politicians trying to overturn the ruling of course, but for now this is our reality.  I've been with my man for fifteen years (we were very, very young when we met!), but we've decided to hold off on making our union legal...for now.  For us, it's simply not a big deal.  Having said that, I'm glad that the option is there for those who do choose to get married.  When I was a young boy growing up gay in small-town Ontario (I thought I was the only one!), I never thought this day would come in my lifetime!  It seems that things are slowly getting better for my brothers and sisters.   I'm writing to let you know that it is possible to make change - you just have to be willing to work for it.  You have some serious opposition in America, so it won't be easy for you, but I believe that you can win.  Be strong, be focused and be patient.  Keep up the fight!   Yours in Toronto,  Georg.

        Do I seem concerned?   Well, I am! Something has clicked inside me...barely audible...but I cannot bear any more of this hyper-conservative rhetoric. I used to be able to roll my eyes and drop it...but I find it impossible to do so any longer. There is an increasing acceptance of discrimination against the GLBT community, and I find that completely alarming.  If you are a fair-minded person, what have YOU done to stop the disrimination to the GLBT community? If you have stood by as this "defense of marriage" legislation has passed in Ohio, your apathy makes you complicit. This stunning (or not-so-stunning) legislation is just one more reason why young, talented and creative minds are leaving Ohio and other locations where discrimination has been legislated.   I may not want to be "married," but I know I do want to be able to share benefits, hospital visitation and inheritance rights, among many other basic rights. This has never been about special rights...it is about EQUAL rights.  I am seriously pissed-off right now.  You should be, too.

        urlLink Bush Supports Cohabitation of Unwed Lovers, by David Rothschild - Democratic Underground   As I was thinking about Bush's drive for a Constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, I became intrigued with a question that is never asked: what should two gay people do, if they do not get married?   Conservatives always argue about what gays should not do: they should not be able to marry, adopt, share benefits, visit each other when they are sick, have power of attorney, inheritance rights, joint custody, sex, or any of the multitude of things that constitute a heterosexual marriage.   Yet, conservatives never give good advise about what they should do: continue to live as unmarried lovers, attend religious conventions and be healed, be imprisoned, or be publicly branded? If conservatives are going to fight against marriage for gay families, they need to offer alternatives.

        garons endommags (damaged boys)     twenty-nine    ...and then everything else happened      I suppose I should have seen it coming. Everything was as it should have been, Jeanine was finishing the baking and the housekeeping; and for the first time in history, I believe everyone had managed to reply. We were expecting over thirty people for an evening of holiday cheer, something our house needed desperately. Jeanine and I were not quite on the same wavelength anymore, and there was no easy way to remedy the situation. Things were shifting, glacially, toward disintegrationand we both knew it. I wish I could say I saw an easy fix, but I didnt. I wasnt even sure that our marriage, our union was what I desired anymore.  During our college years, it had seemed the natural way of things: Daniel and Jeanine getting married, having a family and living happily ever after. The truth is, Im still not sure its the right decision for anyoneafter all, its never just your decision is it? No, there are always others involved, families, friends and anyone who can muster up an opinion seems to have input. In the end, its a marriage of expectation. And that, my friends, is a marriage built on a foundation of sweet, frothy meringueliable to dissolve at any moment, crumble at the slightest change in temperature. Impenetrable to the gaze, but destined for collapse and consumption.  And what did they know anyway? Yes, they all had opinionsmarry Jeanine; youll be better off with a smart girl like herlook at those childbearing hips. Truth?  I never wanted kids, but it seemed like something we were expected to do. Do you want to know something else? Im sterile. I cant have kids. Its like God himself saying, Daniel, you are a horrible role model and not worthy of procreating.    Jeanine was devastated, of course. But, in my heart, I think she was relieved to find out that it wasnt her fault, it wasnt her failingit was mine. It was something I could never undo or fix. It was permanent failure. Of course, she never said anything like that, but I could see it in her. I could imagine the conversations with her mother describing my genetic inadequacies, my flaws, my defects.   In the end, I suppose I dont really care. All of this is much easier to carry off without baggageminiature versions of ourselves. And why, for Gods sake, would we want to bring more of our miserable selves into the world? That, I could never understand. I think only the happy, successful people should be allowed to reproduceso we dont get a world full of angry, depressed people like us.  Anyway, everything in our charade was going along fine. The invitations were complete, the holiday gifts were purchased and the house was trimmed like Christmas in Vienna. We were expecting guests and family and then, I saw him outside the window, crying. He was looking at Bradens door like he couldnt believe hed been tossed out the door like so many before him. Id seen him there looking so helpless and fragileso feminine. Something in me justsnapped.   Anyway, is this bothering you? I said to him hello. And I kissed him. And in one instant I knew I needed to be with him. It was so strange because I had never felt that way about anyone else before, not even Jeanine. Isnt that weird? I pushed him up against the garage door and kissed him hard, forcing my tongue into his warm mouthtasting Velamints and cigarettes. It felt like Christmas. Fucking insane, isnt it? Me, kissing some eighteen year old street rat that Braden discarded like the trash he was.  No big deal, even after the motel and all that. Its the first and only time Ive ever done anything like thatI mean, Im not gay, but we had sexand all I could think about was how amazing it felt and how much I hated this stupid piece of white trashand how much I loved that he wanted me.  Anyway, it was like the first trash day after Christmas when everyone throws everything away, right? So, whatever that wasI got it off my chestso I could move onfocus on being a husband to Jeanine, a good employee at work and a respectable member of the church.  And, I think it helped, too. Jeanine and I started screwing like rabbits and I threw myself into overtime at work. I wanted to show them that I wasnt a loser. I even accepted a position as Deacon at church. Now, I dont think about it muchalmost like it didnt happen. Still, there was my lifeand then everything else happened.  Did you hear about those faggots? Yeah, they want all those special rightslike, to get married. Imagine that, fucking up the institution of marriage. Fucking faggots.

        unpacking boxes  v 2.0  again, for Kelly   There is the undoing of an entire household. Separations, inventories and decisions...which objects are staying, and which will go to the next place. There are the tangible items, and even more, there are memories. The last time I spent any time at all in the basement, besides laundry, was a few years ago as Kelly packed up and moved a few miles away. It was as much a time for me to clean, discard, reorganize as it was for me to simply remember. Just thinking of all that's changed in three years since her departure has me reeling and dizzy with emotion.  I know this bittersweet feeling from once before...leaving college. And while I have tried to express what that last day felt like for me, I have never been able to find words. For me, it was a complicated web of emotions much to difficult and sweet to actually sort out. So I left it alone...neatly packed in boxes in my basement. Now...I'm opening them and wading through the flood.   We leave ourselves behind in pieces. Shards of history in dusty corners and under the sofa cushions. We leave bits of truth and scraps of lies in linen closets and under the sink in the bathroom. These are parts of a life unvisited, seen only by the landlord or cleaning crew long after departure.  I graduated University in late summer, long after my fellow friends and classmates in June. I spent my last weeks there relatively alone, pondering the future, pondering what everyone ponders when leaving someplaceleaving someplace significant. I think I was glad that shed gone, my roommate and close friend of many years. Like the rest, shed gone north to spend the summer with her family. Shed return at the end of summer quarter to help me pack up and clean. I would move home, she would move into another apartment and continue school.  I wasnt sure what came next, and I spent the summer thinking about it, trying to decipher my own personal mystery.  The trees, which lined East Frambes were old and fat with life, their canopy stretching nearly a mile uninterrupted. I walked to the end of the street where it intersected High and waited for the bus. Sometimes immersing myself in anonymity helped, helped me not to think too much. I watched the old ladies counting change and buttons in their coin purses. I watched black boys tease black girls and talk smack. I watched crazy men mutter to everyone and no one. I started talking aloud to myself, watching people watch me.  We passed the Short North galleries and pubs and all the pretty, happy wonderful peopleperking along the sidewalk, chirping to each other or into cell phones. They walk briskly in Kenneth Cole shoes and wear clothes the color of charcoal.  Sometimes Id just walk, walk for hours across campus or across town. I wanted to take all of it in before Id leave. I knew that once I graduated, Id be gone for a very long while. My four years had too many highs and too many lows for it not to be painful leaving, or to return. And, in all this aloneness, Id come to find a slow torture where everything became melancholic. Everything reminded me of something else. And yet, I couldnt turn away from itI had to steep in it, to understand every momentexperience it and catalog it for future reference. What once was a campus bustling with thousands of students was dark and quietserene.  I walked to Park Hall, my first residence on campus, and looked up at the eleven-story building, standing empty, and checked it off my list of good-byes.  The morning I graduated started on the floor, as my bed was already packed and shipped home. I readied for commencement and donned my cap and gown. I walked to St. John alone and took my place next to the other students in my linenone were even familiar to me.  I graduated alone in a sea of strangers, and met my family afterwards outside. As they took pictures and chattered about the occasion, my mind drifted to all the people and places I had come to know and loveall the things which would become part of my history.  We lunched at the Mohawk, my favorite bar and restaurant before heading back to my apartment to pack the last few armfuls of college detritus. Nothing felt right anymore. I didnt belong. This was not my home, and this was no longer my life.  I rode with my sister on the long drive home. I told her stories about my friends and the places we loved, I told her stories about everything I could remember. I told her stories hoping Id never forget the small things that made me love that part of my life. I arrived back at home with my family, filing my boxes away in the attic like lost treasure.  I still have boxes from that move. Even though Ive lived in two other homes, Ive never sorted through them all. They are rife with memories, rife with tears and sweet kisses long gone.  Years later, Im still unpacking boxes, sifting out my past and my present on the basement floor in front of me, spread out like a flea market. And I look in amazement wondering how I endured, wondering how it all shaped me, wondering if any of it matters at all...but I think I know the answer.   I look at these bits of me, taking inventory of my past, and of our recent lives together...relishing every moment. Until it's just me and the remnants of difficult, brave decisions scattered among the boxes...and jumbled memories...and the dust...  I walk up the stairs, shut off the basement light, and leave it all behind once more.

           Nantahala   The photograph  imperfect though our smiles were as we boarded that raft and set sail into the Nantahala with rapids to be forded and miles to discover, dreams and disappointments swallowed in eddies lapping at our prickled flesh  we overturned in the smooth quiet waters above silky unseen boulders, feet touching, slipping from moss and slime redirecting our course toward some swirling angry pool begging us forward we clutch and claw the rubber hauling ourselves over and inward heaving our water weight aboard back just above the thin slice of boat, resting and breathing laughing at our own soggy misfortune, waiting for another turn dizzy and silly  some of those hours floated by green and gray beguiled, we watched the shore slip past in an endless ribbon silky and raw and it was unreachable and unstoppable as we gurgled past our own present an odd circus we watched from the river, an audience rushing downstream in the weight of the water sifting us and sorting us through rocks and channels; bobbing up and licking the sky; sinking with us toward rounded pebbles and gravel bottom  there is no end, only departure from Nantahala and we wave goodbye with paddle and knapsack, with scraped knees and chipped teeth wading in the calm toward the flat, toward the dusty and the dry watching as we pass, knowing we will never again return unchanged

        garons endommags (damaged boys)    twenty-eight   went unsaid      There were three of them, scattered about the country as if God had thrown them like dice. And, it seemed, for awhile, as if none of them would ever find home again.  Connecticut Avenue sprawled out for blocks in front of him, as it did every night on his walk home from work. Hed take the subway to the M Street stop, and hed walk the rest of the way. Tonight, the stars were sprinkled across the winter sky, brilliant and winking. Hed thought it strange to see the stars so well in the city. He couldnt ever remember seeing them here. But, there were many things he hadnt noticed in the months since hed moved there, in the months his brother had been found dead in Los Angeles, a victim of depression, asphyxiated. Matthew had completed law school, passed the bar and was already working for a prestigious L.A. firm when the depression deleted him from the world. Outwardly, there was nothing to notice, except for the success and the drive and his accomplishments. Hed worked hard all the way through his undergraduate at Wake Forest and at Stanford, completing his law degree. His family was supportive, but never knew the whole truth. They never understood himcompletely. Everything had seemed fine until the phone call at 4am from his roommate Thom, explaining the horrific details, collapsing their world into oblivion.  Matthew was a good soul. He inherited his fathers sense of duty and mission to those less fortunate. He took special care of those ailing and afflicted by HIV and even spent a summer on the African subcontinent assisting in clinics, if only to offer moral support, or a hug or a smile. There, hed met Thom who was a direct services manager for UNICEF, stationed in Addis-Ababa, Ethiopia for a year.  By the time Matthew had finished his summer, they were madly in love with each other and dreading the enormous distance between them. They vowed to remain in touch. And they did. So, when Thom finished his tour of duty, hed relocated to the west coast to be with Matthew. It was there that Matthew first began his life as a gay man, living with the person hed loved more than anyone else, ever. It was there that hed begun his terrifying and lonesome battle with depression, a battle hed lost one night in November.  Michael was living at the opposite side of the States, having moved to D.C. from New York, where hed worked in the French Embassy. Hed been transferred to the Office of Consular Affairs in September, before Matthews final, wild descent into suicide. It was more complicated than he could imagine, not that hed ever wanted to imagine his brother dead. More than that, Matthew was his twin, a part of him, and he was terrified that whatever got to Matthew would be quick on its heels to devour him as well. It made for fitful sleep and worrisome days. And, he was tired of talking about it. Tired of explaining it over and over. Exhausted from the grief, sleepy from the late night and endless tossing and turning, haunted by his brothernever knowing if it was real or imagined. Hed thought of happier times, simpler times, when there was life and lovewhen there was Marcus.  His walk down Connecticut Avenue seemed refreshing and different. Something had changed within him, and it was indeed welcome. There was a sense of emerging, a sense of regaining himself and his life. If only the pieces could come back together as quickly as theyd fallen apart. There was the challenge. And, truth be told, Michael was not good at all with puzzles.  Adam had managed to find his way to Miami, seemingly, by chance. Hed always claimed Seasonal Affective Disorder, but Ben knew better. Adam was always dissatisfied with the way things were, with the status quo. If he was in Cleveland, it was the weather or Midwestern mentality. If he was living on the West Coast it was complaints about the cost of living or the accumulation of freaks. When he lived on the East Coast, there was nothing but distain for the attitude and the verbal sniping.  Somehow, hed managed to find a sense of peace and belonging in Miami. Maybe it was the club drugs. Maybe it was the clearly defined sense of purpose: his medical residency or maybe it was truly the one place there was nothing wrong. Ben suspected that it was a matter of time until there was something wrong with Miami, but for now, Adam was content. And that was no small matter, indeed. It was Miami where Adam seemed to do a lot of growing. Hed made realizations about his past choices, about his past life and relationships. And more, hed shared these revelations with Ben.  Maybe they were supposed to be together after all. Maybe it was just one big waiting game, speckled with failed relationships. Both of them regarded their years together as the best overall, and it always went unsaid what seemed to be obvious to Ben.  There were ten years and four different cities between them, and maybe fifteen different lives. There was no one who had remained so regularly in his life, no one who had ever loved him like Adam. More and more, he was convinced hed met, lost and then become almost a brother to the great love of his life. Nothing seemed clear. There were no obvious choices to be made. No bold steps to be taken. So Ben did what he knew besthe waited.  Adam doubted he would ever have the pure and total love of someone like hed had with Ben. There were too many failures since then. He and Ben were wildly different people than the boys they were ten years ago. Adam had believed in true love, and at 22, had found it in Ben. But, it was ever elusive. He thought hed collided with it once or twice since, but there was no doubt from this present perspective that it wasnt even close. Oh, hed wanted it to be...maybe even willed it to be, but it wasnt, and it vanished each time like being startled out of a long, sleepy dream. In Miami, hed managed to find a bit of himself, and looking back, didnt like everything he saw. But, that was the way it was; there was nothing he could do to change the past. He could only look ahead toward some distant horizon, out where the cruise ships and sail boats fell out of view and off of the planet. He wondered about things. He thought of Ben up north and smiled. And he waited.

        garons endommags (damaged boys)     twenty-seven    jump in the lake      He didnt know why it hit him just then, but Ben remembered it like he was back there, back in high school and pining. His stomach felt like it did then, knotty and tight, like he would vomit his affection for the entire world to see; and he could think of nothing more horrifying.  Ben remembered working at Hicksons the summer before his junior year at Kenston. Hed hated almost everything about it. Hicksons wasnt exactly just a gift shop; it was also an old-fashioned sweets shop, Christmas store and restaurant. It was a cluster of turn of the century farm buildings that had been converted into this odd assortment of shops. At 16, Ben was truly the lowest man on the totem-pole with duties ranging from push-mowing the 2.8 acres of grass, to washing the steps and cleaning the bathrooms.  Somehow, his first taste of real work didnt suit him, even though he was good at it. There were the women shoppers always gawking and clucking and chattering. There were co-workers, but none who did what he did. He was the heavy laborer as far as everyone else was concerned. He lifted and toted and reached things on the upper shelves. Once, hed managed to break a grotesque Royal Dalton mug of some sort. The faces bulged and stared out from the shelves until they were purchased.  When he started the job, he was trained by the person he was replacing, an eighteen year old senior named Wade. Wade went to school in the next town over, but Ben knew of him. He'd seen him on the soccer field, leading his team to victory, and running the long distance events for the track team. Wade diligently explained every last detail of the odd jobs that would be foisted on Ben. He told Ben that he was leaving because it was too difficult to find enough time for school, soccer and a part-time jobso the job had to go.  Wade stood just shy of six feet tall. He had nearly jet black hair which was cropped short. His frame was lean and defined; he sported an end of summer tan and a mouthful of perfect white teeth which would glint every time he smiled. Ben was instantaneously smitten, and while he did not yet understand that he was gay, he knew he was infatuated. He was as enamored as he was in the second grade with his summer camp counselor, Leif. Leif was gorgeous and tan and sweet and smelled of clean linen. Ben was seven and knew nothing of sex, but he wanted nothing more than to be with Leif, to sit next to him, and to love him as much a seven year old couldlike he loved his chocolate lab, Checkers.  Ben flushed, embarrassed. This was ridiculous. He was sixteen and had no use for elementary school crushes. But the more he tried to dismiss it, the more he wanted to be around Wade.  Ben rode his bike the three miles to work, and every day passed the subdivision where Wade lived. Now that the school year had started, Wade was busy with soccer and other extracurricular activities, living the most exciting life ever, Ben imagined. On more than one occasion, Ben rode his bike through the subdivision, hoping to catch a glimpse of him coming or going. Wades house was a large white colonial with new landscaping and a winding asphalt driveway leading up to the garage. No one ever seemed to be departing or arriving. In fact, it barely seemed a family lived there at all.  Eventually, Ben quit his job at Hicksons and his crush on Wade tapered off. After college, Ben heard that Wade had graduated with honors from the Naval Academy at Annapolis and was now stationed in San Diego, flying helicoptersand married.  There was this theme in his life, wanting the unattainableyearning for what could never be his, and it always stung, like it was new and fresh.  Ben walked down to the shore in the evenings after work, to think and to rearrange things in his mind. He walked along the edge of the gentle surf, lapping at his bare feet. Marcus was no different than any other crush or infatuation. He would never have Marcus, Marcus was impossible. There was no other option but to live next door and participate in this odd little friendship that was fragile and impenetrable.  Ben wanted to wash it away, rinse the residue of childishness, of unrealistic desire, of rejection. He removed his clothing and folded into a neat pile on the beach, ran into the lake and dove beneath the surface, where the quiet and the cold cleansed him, soothing past injuries, past foolishness.

        uh-oh it's January again...   [-] Fuck! It got cold and snowy again. I know, I know...I really shouldn't be surprised...living in Cleveland and all. Friday, I picked up the Vee-Dub from the dealership and I am happy to report that it has been whipped back into shape. When you spend that much money on maintenance, it's nice when you can actually notice a difference.  [-] Met up with the company of Jacques Brel that night and had a blast! I'm really looking forward to getting back on stage. Luckily, I will reprise many of the same material I did in my first run of the show...this turns out to be quite convenient, fun and  a major time saver!  [-] Saturday, Jeff and I went out to visit Dad who is home recovering from hernia surgery. He didn't luck-out, and had to have open surgery. He seems to be doing well and enjoying his painkillers.   [-] Sunday was reserved for some much needed work-related clothes shopping and our usual Sunday evening ritual: making dinner together and mindlessly relaxing in front of the tube watching HBO, Netflix or Tivo.

         things from today     [+] My Jetta is in the shop for its 60k service, plus a busted headlamp and oxygen sensor. My invoice will be at least $730, if not more. Feh! Tracy at VW said the   good news   was that they had all the parts and could get it all finished today.     hooray.     [+] I got a call today re: Jacques Brel. The time has come to do the show again. I will be joining the Huntington Playhouse cast for a run in May. I'm looking forward to revisiting the show...it's been 6 years since I did it the first time.  [+] I am getting an in-office massage today at 1:30. A massage therapist comes every few weeks to revive and refresh us here at work. Nice!  [+] I have so much project writing work to do for work that won't get done in our open-plan office environment. Know what that means? I get to take work home with me.

        That's showbiz, kid...   Nunsense...it's habit forming!    I spent most of last week with the touring company of Nunsense. The 20th Anniversary Tour features Darlene Love, Georgia Engel, Mimi Hines, Lee Meriwether and Kaye Ballard, all of whom were wonderful to work with. I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with Kaye Ballard, former Clevelander and big-time Broadway belter.  In case you don't know much about her, here's her bio:      KAYE BALLARD Instantly recognizable from her numerous television appearances (particularly her co-starring role with Eve Arden in the cult hit series, MOTHERS-IN-LAW), Kayes stage career includes starring roles on Broadway in THE GOLDEN APPLE, CARNIVAL, MOLLY and THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE, off-Broadway in Ben Bagleys DECLINE AND FALL..., OVER THE RIVER and her one woman show, HEY MA! and elsewhere in GYPSY, NUNSENSE and dozens more. Most recently she starred on tour in THE FULL MONTY, in the pre-Broadway tryout of QUARTET (a new play by Ronald Harwood) and as Mama Brice to all 15 Fanny Brices in the all-star concert version of FUNNY GIRL at the New Amsterdam Theatre, home of the original Ziegfeld Follies. Kaye also starred in many films, her favorite being Terrence McNallys THE RITZ. On recordings, Kaye introduced such standards as Lazy Afternoon, Fly Me To The Moon and Maybe This Time. She currently lives in Palm Springs with her three lhasa apsos, who arent the least bit impressed by any of it.   Over the course of our week together, we talked almost non-stop about theater, Broadway, the most incredible production of Follies  ever  that she co-starred in, and about family, history and our shared love of dogs. She is my new best friend. I was invited to her sister's home for an enormous luncheon for the cast and crew, which was as delicious as it was fun. Her sister has a veritable casino in the basement where I helped turn $5 into $40 at the slot machines.  But, I digress...  We met for breakfast on Saturday before my sojourn to Columbus. We exchanged addresses and phone numbers and made promises to stay in touch. She insisted that I come stay with her at her home in Palm Springs. How could I say no?! So, the week was a complete joy for me.  I ended up with a few more friends last week...and that's always like hitting the jackpot.

        Recrudescent   So, I met up with my college friends Chris and Anne this past Saturday. Chris and I were freshman year roommates, one of those fortunate pairings that brought about a lot of fun and creativity. Anne was a friend from the Theater Department who got to know Chris through our frequent trips to the movies. Chris and I were dorm-bound freshmen and Anne had a car. Perfect!      photo: chris glass   Going back there was like traveling to another continent for me. It had been ten years since I had really visited. So, going back to Columbus this time was a major mental time-warp for me. I know it probably wasn't so much for them...but for me, there was something strange and familiar around every corner. I guess, in that sense, I was in my own little world...desperately trying to play catch-up with the city, my friends and myself. It was so wonderful to be able to sit and talk with both of them, remembering college and learning a little about the past ten years in their lives. While there have been a lot of big experiences and, no doubt, lots of stuff we didn't cover yet...things seemed comfortable...like we slipped back ten years. As Chris surmised, maybe we haven't really changed all that much.   I'm just really glad we did it. It made me happier than I thought...

       Out of the woods...   I wish I was hiking the Appalachian Trail   Do you know what it's like to be in the deep woods where the foilage is so dense, it seems like dusk at midday?  Notes from a summer hike (with Kelly T):  My hike today was through very rugged, very deep woods terrain. The 90-degree heat was tempered a little by the dense vegetation, but the humidity was stifling. We hiked through steep ravines and forded over 8 or 9 streams. The water levels are low due to the summer-long draught we've been experiencing. I was reminded of my days at Camp Lejnar every summer from 2nd grade thru 7th. I was an expert in orienteering...which is to say...getting myself back outta the woods with no more than a compass and a canteen. Imagine being 8 years old & dropped in the middle of the woods and being expected to find your way back to camp. I loved the thought of it...and I won first prize every time. Something about trusting my intuition at a very early age.   Anyhow, hiking the Buckeye Trail today reminded me of trusting myself, following my own path and arriving at my desination with little more than the shirt on my back. It reassured me that I know how to find my path, and that I am not afraid to walk it...alone or with friends...we always get to where we're going.

       Reconnect.  What a wild week! I've managed to reconnect with no less than four friends from my distant and not-so-distant past. Something must be in the air. The most surprising was the sudden resurfacing of my childhood best friend, Ryan Lyden. I have written about him on this weblog back in 2001, hoping he might Google himself and find my post...and that's exactly what happened! So, after 19 years, we finally got the chance to talk and catch up. Also recently reconnected: Anne, Chris and Rich. It's been like finding a favorite lost toy.

        (damaged boys)    thirty   finding Wyatt   Dear Wy,  It was like getting kicked in the stomach. I hadn't thought of you in over a year, and the sight of you brought it all flooding back to me. Dancing there in the club, thoughts of you swirled around my head as intoxicating as the alcohol. I saw you and you didn't see me, and I liked that. You had that gorgeous grin, your teeth a mouthful of Chicklets, and the tight white shirt clinging for its very life, stretched impossibly across your chest. I was laughing at you dancing, looking so goofy and sexy all at the same time, managing not to notice me even four feet away. But it was dark and flickery, the flash-flash-thump of the dancefloor and we all were twirling in and out of consciousness. We were both visceral and alive, and in our own worlds, separate.  I don't remember why we stopped talking, but I do remember first meeting you that day along the beach. It was one of those first days of the summer when the sun was high, and the warmth felt new and intriguing. I had taken Sophie for a walk, and you met us afterward, in the parking lot. You rode up on your bike, like some adonis, golden brown and smiling. I had that feeling like being kicked in the stomach, temporarily not able to breathe.   We chatted for an hour or so in the late afternoon sun, alternately playing with Sophie to break the tension of the first meeting and talking like we were somehow old friends. We had so much to talk about. Time passed and the sun began setting over the lake. We decided to drop off Sophie at home, and have dinner at the Mango, to keep talking, to keep figuring it out.    Afterward,  you took me on a walk around the old neighborhood, pointing out your childhood home and looking for a new place to rent. It seemed like we were both stalling, not wanting the evening to end. And that's how I remember everything with you...not wanting it to end.  Maybe we talked too much. Maybe we finished the conversation because, after a while, there wasn't anything new to say. I think you cleverly evaporated because you don't know how to do anything else when you get close to someone. I'm not really sure what happened, and I know you were wrong for me, but there I was at the club watching you. I had to ask myself why you seemed so compelling.   All at once, the music mixes into something I recognize, and I submit to the bass and the strobe. The pulse quickens and the world around me dissolves. I wish I could think of something to say. But we've said everything already, haven't we?  I am swallowed into a wall of dancing, writhing bodies, losing track of you completely. At night's end, you are nowhere to be found, and I pretend it all never happened.  But, I saw you. I felt something.  - Ben

       Wicked tired.  Rehearsals have been humming along nicely. We've actually been doing full run-throughs for a week now...way ahead of schedule.  On the down side, the constant running of the show is making us all a little tired...and I am grateful for the night off tonight!

        Out View  Notes from the big gay closet...  Its too easy to be disengaged. Weve spent our lives being told to stay in the closet, to not ask and not tell,  and to otherwise not acknowledge our existence. Is it any wonder that inertia is the toughest battle we face as a community? We face violence and hatred. We deal with prejudice and homophobia. Why on earth would anyone want to speak up and be noticedor be counted for that matter?  No, this inertia is not perplexing to me. After all, its so much easier to be a part of the gay community when its convenient, like on the weekends at the clubs surrounded by hundreds of like-minded individuals. We want to feel good RIGHT NOWdancing, drinking, using and fuckingor hoping to do any number of these things.  Well, there is lots of fucking going onand were doing it to ourselvesby not standing up and making our voices heard. Once again, the gay community is poised to be marginalized and set off to the side. And we seem completely comfortable letting them steer this issue. But, we can be heard and understood. We look like them, and we are as educated and experienced.  We are everyday gays. We have careers, do community work, donate to charities, volunteer, go to churches and synagogues and mosques. We consume, we purchase and we develop brand loyalties. We have unrealized power and influence. We pay taxesa lot of them. We are expected to participate as citizens fully, sharing the financial burdens, but unable to access the benefits equally. If this doesnt INCITE you, what does?   Do your friends know you are gay? Does your family know? Does your employer know? If you answered no to any of these questions, you need to fix thatand fix it NOW. Come out, come out wherever you are! There is no way for the greater community to realize its full potential without the clarion call of YOUR voice. Yes, we need you. Yes, one more homo does make a difference. We need you now, more than ever, to be truthful to yourself and to others in your life.   I do not accept a destiny fated by conservative white men in our capitals. Chiefly, the Republican Party is responsible for supporting decades of oppression, suppression and fear of the gay community. It is undeniably ironic that a nation founded on the principles of religious freedom, freedom from persecution and on a separation of church and state finds itself in a decidedly Christian quagmire, wanting to dictate morals from a conservative Christian point of view. Does that piss you off? It should.   The time is now for personal activism. How do I do that? you ask? Do these things for yourself. Do them for your community. Do it to help combat rampant stupidity and hate:  1.	Write an editorial letter to your newspaper and use your real name. 2.	Join groups like HRC, the DNC, Stonewall Democrats and your local GLBT community center. 3.	Stay informed. Read the newspaper, listen to talk radio and watch the news.  4.	Get involved with community groups and make your voice heard. 5.	Teach others how to get involved. 6.	Accept nothing less than equality.  As a community, we are at a critical juncture, we can stand up for ourselves, put ourselves in harms way and fight a difficult battle for equality, or we can be continually bullied by government, the media and intolerant hate-mongers set on keeping us locked in a metaphorical closet. The time is now.   What will YOU do?

       I am eating Eclipse mints and sipping too-strong java from Corporate Coffee across the street. It's snowing outside and again it's not. The sun is out and hiding at the same time. I half expect it to start raining frogs any minute now. Is that a herd of sheep grazing its way up the street?

       Sorry for the silence.  I was out of town for a conference that started last Wednesday. On this past Monday, the house right behind mine burned down. I woke up early Monday morning to my neighbors house in flames. I was at once fascinated and horrified. Everyone got out okay, but they lost two of their three pet dogs...along with most all of their belongings. It was heartwrenching...and even more so for them. Ugh!  I just got back from shooting a commercial outside in the rain today. I think the end result will be pretty goofy...but it was fun doing it! It had me and a handful of other Cleveland residents and business people lip-synching to this silly soundtrack about taxes. In the end, I probably will have humiliated myself in front of the entire viewing area, but what the hey?!?!

        Gay Marriage: What Are Conservatives Afraid Of?  By Scott C. Smith  I'm very excited. I am now an ordained minister! And no, it didn't take me years of study. I didn't just graduate from a seminary. I filled out a form online, for free! I now have a snazzy print-out of a certificate listing my credential to perform marriage ceremonies and other duties. The next step is taking the form to my county clerk and pay a $20 registration fee. I'll then be duly authorized by the State of Oregon to conduct a legal marriage ceremony.   Republicans like to talk about the "sacred" institute of marriage, and they believe that by allowing homosexuals to marry, it will destroy this sacred institution.   Hey, guys, it's already been destroyed. By heterosexuals. We've been running the show for a long time now, and the damage has been done. The fact that I can perform a ceremony with no formal education or training is proof enough that marriage is not as sacred as Republicans make it out to be. I think homosexuals might have a real shot at actually repairing the foundation of marriage. A real shot if we'd let them.   In the United States, a gay couple that has been together 20 years cannot get married. Yet a convict serving a 20-year sentence in prison can - even a prisoner on death row! Just think: you can commit horrible crimes against humanity, but as long as you're heterosexual, you don't lose your right to get married. You know, if I had to choose, I'd think the convict would do more damage to the institution of marriage than the gay couple with a murder-free background. Call it a hunch.   Yet Republicans are so threatened by the possibility of gay marriage that they're ready to amend the Constitution. And let's be honest, some of the more vocal Republican voices speaking out against gay marriage do not exactly have a great track record with this institution. Newt Gingrich comes to mind. There's an old joke:   "Republicans believe so firmly in marriage that they do it over and over and over again."   Republicans who believe in the sanctity of marriage surely have never been to Las Vegas (one exception: William Bennett, although he probably was a little distracted by his gambling). Or Reno. Head into one of the resort hotels and you'll find a chapel. Hell, head into a 7-11 and the clerk can perform the ceremony in between waiting on customers.   Do you want Elvis to perform the ceremony? Done. Want to be married in a limo? How about underwater? Sure. Don't have the time to actually get out of your car? No problem! Las Vegas can accommodate any wacky wedding idea. Take that, traditional marriage.   Reality television has also made a mockery of the sanctity of marriage, with shows like Married by America and Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire. Complete strangers get on television for quickie weddings.   Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon are the lesbian couple that got the gay-marriage ball rolling in San Francisco. They've been together 51 years. Yet, until recently, the State of California would deny them the opportunity to marry. Oh, sure, let the reality TV couple get married for ratings, but a real, committed couple, who have done so much for their community, are not allowed to marry because they are lesbians. And that's the only reason.   Quick, can you figure out who in the following list is not allowed to get married? Drug dealer; murderer; abuser; adulterer; crack whore; child molester; serial killer; cannibal; Sean Hannity. The answer: they all can!   The divorce rate in the United States is still about 50%. The Religious Tolerance web site, which complies divorce data, reports that the divorce rate among Conservative Christians is at 29%. This is the group that has been the most vocal about homosexual marriage. Maybe they should fix their own problems first? If they can't get marriage right, maybe it is time to let a different group have a shot at it.   This whole issue seems like a no-brainer, although since right-wingers are involved, it's more complicated than it needs to be. For instance, allow churches, synagogues and other houses of worship to decide if they want to conduct a homosexual wedding ceremony. Existing U.S. laws will cover the goofy "slippery slope" arguments right-wingers give. If homosexuals are allowed to marry, I really have a hard time seeing the law changed to accommodate someone who wants to marry their dog. It's not going to happen. It's already illegal to marry a blood relative or to be married to multiple partners. What are Republicans so afraid of? Maybe we could ask Newt Gingrich.

       I have one of those sleep hangovers. You know, the kind where you sleep so well that when you wake up, you feel like you're  still sleeping. After a busy weekend, it was harder to kick into gear this morning. Spent Friday working in the yard and getting it ready for planting season, and took Toby on a nice long walk at Edgewater Park. We both enjoyed the sunshine and the relatively mild weather. Saturday, more errand-running, dog walking and catching-up with Tivo. We went out drinking/dancing at the Grid with some friends from work, and finished off the night with breakfast at 4am. Easter rolled around a little too soon, but we managed to recuperate for a bit before heading out to my parents for dinner. Had fun playing a raucous game of hide and seek with my 9 year old nephew. That's the brief. I'll think of something more to write later...I gotta go look at some Excel speadsheets or something.

       Snotty Weekend     So, I barely survive Friday...my cold came into full bloom and I was extra miserable all day. Then went to rehearsal in the frozen barn, which helped make matters worse, no doubt. Saturday, downing all sorts of cold pills, vitamins, zinc and anything else that might remotely help. Then, migraine hit...a lingering one that lasted all the way past 8pm...and included a spectacular fit of migraine-related vomiting. Seriously considered poking ice pick thru temple. Pain subsided completely by 9:30pm.  Sunday morning, I woke with no migraine and, mysteriously, no cold symptoms. Is as if migraine killed the cold. Intriguing. Felt human again. Was brilliantly productive with domestic chores. Rewarded self with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.

        why i write/don't write...   When we all started this, years ago in my case, blogging was, for me, a simple way to write and to keep writing. Blogging was relatively unnoticed, flying under the radar of mainstream  anyone . What I loved was the sense that only people who had similar interests might stumble across the site. I didn't feel the pressure to produce or be "on" or to say anything in particular. As time progressed and more people started to blog and pay attention to blogs, I found it more and more difficult to say the things I wanted to say. Unextraordinary.com has always been a place where I felt safe saying almost anything...it was a place where I felt it was okay to be melancholy, provocative, silly, newsy and everything else. Maybe it still is, but I gotta tell you, it's weird sitting down to write anymore without thinking of the eyes out there reading...and I hate to think I've edited myself because of it. But, things change and I've had to adapt. I think I have been spending a lot of time trying to figure out just what the hell to do with this blog anymore.  Look, this has never really been an issues blog, nor has it delved into politics or anything of that nature. Sure, you have a sense of my leanings and my beliefs, but I refuse to become simply a site made up of other people's content...that's not what drew me to blogging. Sure, there will always be linkers and content-grabbers, as well as blog pundits and observers, that's just not me. I never wanted my blog to resemble anything close to a job, nor did I really want an audience of expectant consumers...I did that for awhile with 'unravel in 58' the ultra-personal look at the rise and fall of a dating relationship via exchanged emails, and also with the 'my big gay life' series. After a few months, I felt the near constant pressure to produce. It became overwhelming. I stopped writing. That's not good because, after all, this site was set up for me, first and foremost.  I know what you're thinking. You think all of us with blogs and websites must be completely egomaniacal, and maybe we are...a little, but I am not doing this to be noticed. I am doing it to participate in the process, to continue workshopping and developing my skill. This is not to tell you to hit the bricks. No. By all means, read away. I can't promise you anything. Nor should I. I can't promise you that I'll be here or that I'll always be honest. Some things gotta stay personal. In the meantime, I'll be off somewhere observing, thinking and having a life (which I do have, actually). Less time in front of a keyboard is good.    Absence makes the heart grow.

       The weekend was a welcome reprieve from the work week, but Sunday morning threw me a small curve ball: my house had sprung a leak...and it was causing one particular electrical outlet to sizzle and spark. So, after cutting that circuit breaker, we investigated the outlet and decided to call the insurance company. This is, after all, why we pay for insurance. So, the claims guy comes today to survey the leak damage and determine the next steps. It's always something, huh?

       My sister was ten and I was six when we first felt the sugary sand of Lake Huron's shores beneath our feet. Our parents had rented a cottage at Cherokee Trails, a now defunct cottage resort in Oscoda, Michigan. Every summer for more than ten, we trekked to northern Michigan to spend time on the beach, play tennis, swim and enjoy nightly bonfires on the beach. These are among my favorite family memories. There were five cottages at Cherokee Trails, and the Stuart family always rented #4. We started going there because some close family friends had been going for years. Well, one week at the cottage sold us for a lifetime! There was beach volleyball, shuffleboard, tetherball, adirondack chair swings, cook-outs, Sunday morning Bloody Mary parties for the adults, fishing...the list goes on and on. We all had different interests. Dad liked to ready trashy espionage paperbacks, swim and drink scotch cocktails in the evenings. Mom like to play volleyball, read Prevention magazine, play tennis and go on random shopping excursions. Mom was also fond of exploring whatever and wherever possible. Jennifer, my sister, liked swimming, tetherball, boys, volleyball, campfires, cookouts and cards (oooh! alliteration). I loved all these things, too...including the boys. I have particularly fond memories of walking up US Route 23 to the "7-Up Store" to buy candy and wildly exciting (and tame) incendiary devices like sparklers, snakes and smoke bombs...always an endless source of summer entertainment. I loved to play Canadian Doubles tennis with my parents...and visiting the Greenbush Library which was adjacent to the tennis courts. Swimming in Lake Huron was always a nippy proposition, but it never seemed to really bother us. We'd bodysurf in the waves and we loved playing on the old metal slide sitting about 30 feet out into the lake. We'd make ambitious sand castles and sand sea-creatures. I remember that we always met and made new friends every summer...there were always new families each year vacationing there. I always laugh when I remember what a treat it was to go into town and go shopping at the Ben Franklin (much like a Woolworth's)...or watching the town ready for the annual East Tawas/Harrisville Art Show, or even "Paul Bunyan Days." I think of all these things and smile. Eleanor and Homer LaGassey owned Cherokee Trails. He was a former Air Force pilot and a very talented pen & ink artist. One of his works hangs in my house, now...the very print that adorned my room in the cottage, as a matter of fact. Homer put the resort up for sale shortly after Eleanor succumbed to Diabetes. I made a pilgrimage to Oscoda a few years ago with Mom and Dad just to check things out...to see what it all looked like. Not much had changed, except that the resort was for sale and empty...but it was all there. I found myself with the sugary white sand beneath my feet. Caught in the swift undertow of not-so-distant memories...it all flooded back, the sun, the laughter...and the peace. Like the morning after a particularly heavy rainstorm, we found the entire beach covered by millions of ladybugs...the sand was deep crimson for as far as the eye could see. Time goes on and everything changes, just a little. I am going back there someday...if just to walk on the shore, or to visit Greenbush Library, play tennis or remember being six years old.

       I have grown used to saying goodbye to people...and I mean that in the least melodramatic way possible. I'm used to it, I just am. Sometimes we want everything to remain the same, and sometimes we want everything to change...and some of us are stuck somewhere in between.     Either way you look at it, I suppose it's good to stir it up a bit. I guess change is change, but it's not always a solution, or more accurately, the total solution. Many times, it's stop-gap until we get to the root of what's really eating us. Change tends to peel back a few layers, like a sticky bandage on a wound...revealing sometimes the painful, sometimes the scarred...and sometimes the healed.    So, we are travelers, journeyers. Go find what  you  seek, that mysteries may be revealed.

       So, yeah.    In order to not freak myself out any more than I already have, I've reduced moving to these seven easy steps:    1. Throw crap out.  2. Sell house.  3. Buy new house.  4. Pack stuff up.  5. Have movers move stuff from old house to new house.  6. Unpack stuff at new place  7. Start new job.    Simple enough, right?

       So, yeah. I went on one of my very infrequent trips to the local gay bar. Within 45 minutes, I'd managed to win a game I like to call  Ex-Boyfriend BINGO.  If you are the first to reach 5 ex boyfriends at any given location, your friends must buy your drinks for the rest of the evening...or you are allowed a guilt-free hasty retreat from said location. Anyway...I won, and I won  fast !    The absolute highlight of the evening was meeting the other gay Todd blogger in Cleveland...you can read him daily (as I do)  urlLink here . It was so cool to meet him face to face!!

I have a wonderful  new job in a city that I love (not that I don't love Cleveland...'cos I do!) and I'm looking forward to the change. I'll still be in the same line of work, just working for a different company. Anyhow, I should be all squared away by mid August.    Anyone wanna buy a restored, historic Victorian in Ohio City with fabulous gay neighbors?
