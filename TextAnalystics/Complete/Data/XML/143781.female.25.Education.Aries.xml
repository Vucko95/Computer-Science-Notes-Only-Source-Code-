						          Maybe one day all of this will have meaning. For now, it all exists as half-doodles in my little black Canson sketchbook, a few back stories as .txt files on my laptop, and a bit of daydreaming during those long train rides. I have always had the desire to make my own comic book, and such a desire has manifested itself in many forms throughout the years. (Some of you will remember, while the rest of you may have no idea.)  It is my hope to take a Tolkien-esque stance with my stories, for I don't have the confidence in myself yet to be as bold and direct as C.S. Lewis in his stories. (Hmm?)

						   Well, I've posted some preliminary images ... I guess I should say something in more detail. I figure a good place to start is general geography - a non-specific lay of the land. Cities and landmarks have yet to be set down with any real detail, so here's just a few notes on climate and scenery and so on and so forth.  The explored (thus known) part of the world consists of a grouping of semi-isolated "islands" of various size, ranging from simple outcroppings of dry rock to stretches of terrain large enough to be considered a decent-sized state or a very small country. I call these rocky places islands for lack of a better name ... they are all, in reality, very high plateaus of rock surrounded not by a sea of water, but by a sea of thick, strangely fluid, and somewhat magical mist. While the mist is not harmful in itself, it is a severe impairment to vision, cannot be traveled over by normal means,  etc. and seems to be a permanent cloudy covering over whatever lies below the plateaus.  The air is thin and dry. Water is available, but not abundant. Only hardy trees, plants, and crops grow on the surface; growing in enough variety to be interesting and nutritional. Animals tend to be small, with the largest predators in the food chain being aviary (large birds, drakes, etc.).  Rivers and lakes and streams exist on the larger plateaus, and sometimes rush over the edges and fall into the mist with very little sound.   Below the misty barrier is mostly unexplored. Those who have traveled down into the clingy fog have usually not lived to come back. Barely below the surface of the mist a variety of scraggly, tough trees jut out of the vertical rock faces, eeking out an existence in the high elevations. Further down into the mist grows an entire jungle. How far below is unknown. Only occasionally has the mist parted in places to reveal a brilliant, alien green-ness that simply shouldn't be growing underneath such a thick, blinding covering. Under the mist is warm and damp, nearly suffocating with humidity to those so used to the arid plateaus.   Mist/jungle flora and fauna are barely documented, and the exact depth until the surface of the world itself has yet to be discovered ... or at least reported. It is likely that large predators live in the jungle, and there are old stories of dragons surfacing from the mist in days long-past. There is only one known intelligent race to live in the jungles, and these mysterious humanoids are viewed with quite a bit of fearful superstition among the supposedly more "civilized" plateau-dwellers. Whether or not they are demons or otherwise is currently unknown, since there is no shared language and encounters are few and far-between.  Above the mists, in a similar fashion to our own planet [with changes depending on latitude] there are definite seasons, with winter being noteworthy for its dry, bitter cold and summer being marked by rain that tends to blur the boundaries between rock and mist. There's one sun and probably a few moons (two or three; I haven't decided yet).   The mist was not always around. That much I have decided. How'd it get there? Hmm ... Stay tuned!
