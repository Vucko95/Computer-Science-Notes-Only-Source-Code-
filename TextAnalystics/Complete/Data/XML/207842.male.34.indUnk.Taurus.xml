      I want to use this blog to help organize a few ideas which have developed over the last few years.  Essentially, just as physicists seek a Grand Unified Theory to combine the  Strong, Weak, Electro-Magnetic, and Gravitational  forces, I'm looking for something of a  Grand Unified Theory of the Humanities .  This is no small task, to be sure. I have no or little formal training for such a task.  I have done a fair amount of reading and a hell of a lot of thinking about this issue (or about these issues, if you will). But if I don't organize and communicate them, my efforts won't do anyone any good.  The first few blogs will, most likely, attempt to discern a natural hierarchy, a method bywhich  blogs  are best organized.

       Interesting. The idea that there's one truth sounds so much like monotheism. To speak in a  Nietzschean  sense, the idea of one truth is a sublimation of the belief in and faith of one god.   The same urge that drives men of and to one god drives others to one truth, and in sciences, one method (the scientific) of arriving at that truth.   In many respects, belief in the scientific method is a belief in uncertainty. One must understand that scientific beliefs are predicated on the idea that they could indeed be incorrect. Of course, it's easy to come to believe absolutely in one's scientific conclusion(s). Twenty years ago, it was widely believed that there existed no planets other than those in our solar system. Today we "know" of several.   Science is a kind of faith in uncertainty. It is a sort of magic that is proven, very much as it was previously, via prediction. Astronomers predict Venusian solar transits. The transit occurs. The power of science, it's validity, it's sovreignty is thereby proven; very much as priestly power was validated by predictions of planetary movements, solar and lunar eclipses.   So if we view Religion/Faith as having necessarily evolved I tend to think of Religion as preceding science because science is viewed as a  modern  method. This view may be inappropriate. This view may be a stumbling block.   Science and Religion have in common a faith in uncertainty driven by the desire to learn, understand, and control the known. We don't wish to be eaten, to die from enemies or the environment. So we're really discussing the sublimation of power and control (Nietzsche and Adler).

        Religion    So why should we, as  existential scientists , appreciate Religion? That is to say, if we aren't going to rely on mumbo-jumbo to explain things, why don't we do away with it altogether?   Another way to ask this question is, why did Religion  evolve  as a psychological presence in man?   And there's the answer.   Religion's affect on men is to be understood and appreciated because it evolved.   Too many men, I think, upon losing faith in Religion (or rather, applying faith to something else) wish to denigrate the value of Religion's affects. They probably do so to the degree to which they were once faithful. [And that sounds so  Nietzscean  that he probably said it already.]   They do so in order to prevent a...relapse.   Of course, when we speak of  the evolution of Religion  we're really talking about  Evolutionary Psychology .

       Religion   A scientific examination of existence should utilize two methods in reaching conclusions.    Absence of Mumbo-jumbo [MJ]  Acknowledgment and appreciation of mumbo-jumbo's presence, perhaps necessity, in our perception of existence.    There are a number of reasons to avoid reliance on [MJ]. For practical reasons, we would be forced to choose a particular [MJ] upon which to base our observations and conclusions. We could then delve into sects, debates of inaccuracies and meanings, historicity, etc, etc.  Such efforts would achieve little more than arguments built upon argument upon argument. Cicular reasoning. An edifice upon a foundation that crumbles at the first tremors of Reason.  Of course, it would be no more correct to reject [MJ] simply because it is difficult (nigh impossible) to choose the "right" one.  No, even if we believed, that is to say, had Faith, that we had chosen (actualy, most often,  inherited ) the "right" [MJ], we would be left with little more than a sort of "my dad can beat up your dad" mentality.  And with such a mentality, we would then need to rely upon other "proofs" of correctness (that is to say, religious superiority). For example, a religion is  superior  based upon such ideas as:   the perceived happiness of it's adherents  coffers (organizational or national)  number of adherents  duration of existence    Ironically, in order to prove a religion's  superiority  it would have to rely upon physical indicators in a world devalued by most religious thought.  So, from a practical point-of-view, we can't rely on [MJ] to explain/understand existence because we can't choose the correct religion, and if we did choose one, would be reduced to using real world physical proof to demonstrate its supposed  superiority .  There is another reason. If one religion is the correct way to gauge our understanding of existence, then religious experience becomes a zer0-sum game. There can be only one winner. There can be only one religion (sounds like a Highlander riff =) ).  It is evident that adherents are willing to take up arms and to kill in order to win such a zer0-sum game.  It is most impractical to consider the consequences of such a "conclusion". Again, in fact, we are faced with a religion which disproves itself in it's efforts to "prove" itself.  Reductio ad Absurdum.   Notwithstanding, Religion does play an important part in our existence. Next time, I'll talk about why it's important to appreciate Religion's affect on us.
