       face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Wow, Ching.    I'm amazed that anyone watches soap operas - seems like everyone I know has 'em going on in their own lives.  Or maybe they watch 'em for advice.        How's your writing going, Ching?  I always liked your stuff!

      Welcome, Jay / Daf ! &nbsp; I'm glad that you made it ! &nbsp; So what do you think so far?&nbsp; Like it?    We have our own drama (or tragedy, depending on how you want to look at it) going on in my parents' household.&nbsp; The past two weeks have been a blur, really..&nbsp; We had our house-warming- slash -birthday party for Brian, which was a lot of fun.&nbsp; Shortly after that, my mom's purse is stolen at work.&nbsp; Her and dad close their bank account and create a new one, get replacement ID cards (driver's license, etc.), cancel credit cards, inform Sprint (her cellphone was in the purse)..&nbsp; Thankfully, her keys and her prescription eyeglasses weren't in the purse (her eyeglasses cost her $400 ~~ mine didn't even come close).&nbsp; I'm not even going into the fact that it was a Dooney & Bourke purse..&nbsp; That's the smallest thing that she was worried about.&nbsp; She was more concerned about the contents.&nbsp; Everything has been taken cared of, I believe..&nbsp; The only thing left to replace is her green card.&nbsp; I don't know how much it costs to replace it, but I heard it's not cheap.&nbsp; It's not like replacing a driver's license.    [ Speaking of which, Brian and I had our driver's licenses replaced a little bit ago.&nbsp; So now, we have new ones that have our new address on them !  ]    Going back to the drama..&nbsp; This is the same week that Matt and Jen broke up, so Jen (and Logan) moved back in.&nbsp; She was in the process of getting my old bedroom reorganized as her bedroom is now the office.&nbsp; That was fine with me and mom and dad welcomed her home with open arms and everything.&nbsp; Within the span of a week (if it was even that), she gets herself kicked out of the house ! &nbsp; She had not even unpacked, yet ! &nbsp; Yes, my sister is seriously messed up.&nbsp; You think she would've grown up now that she's a mom and almost 21 ~~ but, NOOO !     Among her list of offenses: (1) sleeping while she's supposed to be watching Logan, (2) partying ~~ even when the baby is sleeping over at mom and dad's house, (3) not coming home from partying, (4) not being around when it's her turn to babysit her own son, (5) not caring about the welfare of her own son, period..&nbsp; The list goes on and on and on.&nbsp; On nights when she parties, she doesn't even bother to call and check on her baby.&nbsp; Mom said that Matt prefers that Logan is with him at all times, doesn't like it when he's away from the baby and when the baby sleeps over at my parents' house, Matt always calls at night to check on how he's doing.&nbsp; Matt has more "maternal" instincts than my sister ! &nbsp; Can you believe it?    The last straw was when Jen brought home this guy, Justin, who she had only known for a couple of days.&nbsp; She had asked before they went out if he could spend the night and mom explicitly said no..&nbsp; For one thing, we barely knew this person.&nbsp; She barely knew this person.&nbsp; The had not even been dating a week and they're already sleeping together.&nbsp; You don't flaunt such blatant irresponsibility in the face of my mom.&nbsp; She is a very patient, understanding and giving person, but there's a line that one should never  ever  cross.    The following morning mom wakes up and notices that Justin's car is still outside.&nbsp; Of course, she begins to wonder.&nbsp; She knocks on my sister's bedroom door (she's in my old bedroom).&nbsp; My sister, in her infinite wisdom, steps out in her underwear.&nbsp; My mom tells her that he needs to leave..&nbsp; If not, both of them have to go.&nbsp; Guess what my sister does.&nbsp; She goes back to sleep.&nbsp; It's like talking to a wall, I'm telling you ! &nbsp; This goes on for a little while.&nbsp; I guess mom tries again, but gets the same response.&nbsp; Ignored, my mom resorts to calling dad who then advises her to call the cops.&nbsp; They don't take her seriously at first (probably thinking that she's bluffing ~~ if there's one thing I know, it's that my parents do not know how to bluff ~~ you better believe it because it's real and it's happening), but when they hear my mom give the policeman descriptions over the telephone, they finally decide that it's time to skiddadle.    The policeman came for a brief period.&nbsp; Jen and Justin were already gone at that point.&nbsp; Mom talked to him for a little bit, wanting some sort of reassurance that she had a legal right to do what she did.&nbsp; He agreed with her and assured her that she wasn't responsible for my sister any longer.&nbsp; Brian and I arrive shortly after.&nbsp; Dad had called me early in the morning and asked me and Brian to come because he was worried about mom and what Jen might do.&nbsp; The whole family thinks very little of her at this point.    So anyway, that's how my sister got kicked out of the house.

        Hi, I'm here. Actually, I heard that Yahoo Clubs will merge with Yahoo Groups. Groups is real cool, as you know! Clubs  is  a bit limited, though.       Here's what's new with us: Jessica (our Ching-aged daughter) is 8 months pregnant - still living at home, lost her job, boyfriend she's not too serious about. We're hoping the baby's going to settle her down a little - she was REALLY drifting.       Andy (our 17-year-old son) has left home, and apparently dropped out of school, to live at his girlf's parents' house. He's gotten a good job (for a 17-year-old) at a performance auto shop, plans to get his GED and hit community college. They already have a baby together - that made things at home  real  rocky.       Kim &amp; I are having a hard time with all this - we're going to counseling to try to get it straightened out. So far we're hanging in there, though.       Job's going well in that they like me &amp; give me raises, but what a PITA! Had to cancel all my vacations for the next 4 months. Grumble.       Church gig's pretty good too. Can't get a sub, though - so I'm TRAPPED!    Help me! Help me!       Daf (tried some HTML - guess we'll find out if I did it right)

      Thanks for joining, Pia ! &nbsp;  There aren't any members yet so I'm really glad that to see you here and to know that you're in this with me..&nbsp; I'm trying to transition from  Yahoo! Clubs  to here because hardly anyone ever visits the old club anyway.    By the way, we rented  Dude, Where's My Car?  yesterday and it's really retarded.&nbsp; It's a collage of all the stupid movies ever made.&nbsp; Think  Dumb and Dumber  meets  Half Baked  (two movies which I have never ever seen and refuse to see ~~ I really cannot believe that I let Brian talk me into watching this one) with a little bit of  Men in Black  and  Galaxy Quest  thrown in.

      We went to see  Atlantis  the other day.&nbsp; It's pretty good.&nbsp; Brian has been looking forward to watching it since the first previews were shown.&nbsp; I liked it but it's not one of my favorite cartoons.&nbsp; I liked  Shrek  better.&nbsp; I also liked  Iron Giant  better.&nbsp;  Atlantis  didn't move me as much as the other two animated films did.    Speaking of animation, the one that we are  really ,  really  looking forward to is  Final Fantasy .&nbsp; I really don't care how much of a story it's got..&nbsp; I'd watch it even for just the animation !! &nbsp; The previews look amazing !     Mom is coming over after work today.&nbsp; She's bringing Logan.&nbsp; I am really looking forward to this afternoon because we will play, play and play.&nbsp; Tonight, Brian and I will attend the weekly Swing Club gathering at WSU.&nbsp; Brian has really come a long way.&nbsp; He knows lots of different turns now.&nbsp; He even knows a lifting move ! &nbsp; Dancing is so much fun !!

      hey congratulations grandpa Jay.   Glee, whats tv patrol? So sorry to hear about your uncle.  My Grandmoter died last year and she was partially blind due to Glaucoma(blood pressure in the eye).She moved back to the Philippines two years ago after my grandfather died.  She was much happier in PI since all her friends were there.  She got to go out and exercise, shop and go to the beauty parlor.  I think your uncle would get better care here in the US but as far as happiness, nothing beats being with people you know.  Its two weeks before my sisters wedding and my brother in law still hasnt ordered the tuxedo's  auurgh..   I just received word that my sister's former roomate Frances has a part in Aida the Disney musical in Broadway.  Woohoo!!!  If you guys want good seats for this play its good that you know someone that is part of it because they can get you good seating.  Full price seating but great seats!!!.  Okay enough plugging, I gotta get my own tickets too.  Dot wants to see it with me and her cousin Kathy.    I saw in the news that another volcano is erupting in Italy.  Wow, is this a sign of worse things to come?      Net

      I was watching the Filipino news program TV Patrol, and I saw the Mayon Volcano erupting. Dang, that's one huge mf! I'm fortunate not have any family members living near that area.      I just got word that my father's brother died from a stroke. He was the only one who did not come to America. I felt sad for him because I think they did not give him a chance most likely because he's blind. I think if he were here, he would have had a lot more opportunities because the government can help provide all sorts of aid for blind people. Then again, I should not judge. I really don't know what his life was like back in P.I.      My poor sister. She has been suffereing from sinus pressure. The doctors don't know why her sinuses won't drain properly. She's going to undergo a cat scan Saturday. I hope it's not anything serious. She's suffering from so much pain she basically stopped taking pain relievers because they don't work.      Nothing exciting is going on today--I'm just going shoe shopping to match my dress. My mother reserved for all four of us to attend my godbrother's wedding Saturday. (Of course, my sister can't go--she has the cat scan.) I wish I did not have to go. But it would be rude not to go since my mom already RSVPed. I just don't know the groom and his family that well. I would feel like I was crashing a formal event.      I went to the Waves of the Word: Movements of Poetry (a benefit for APIA Youth Poetry) Wednesday night. That was da bomb! If you ever get the chance to see the Chicago spokenword group I Was Born With Two Tongues or NYC's spokenword/music crew FEEDBACK, check them out ! I think they do tours and benefits. California, esp. the Bay Area, has its gems: 8th Wonder. All three groups are a must see.

      Good morning, everyone ! &nbsp; Portland is bugging again so we won't be able to publish for the time being.&nbsp; Everything should be okay in the next 24-48 hours.&nbsp; Just be patient and keep blogging anyway.    Hey, did you guys hear about Mayon Volcano?&nbsp; It's been errupting sporadically for the past two months and after a two week lull, I heard it errupted again ! &nbsp; I'm so glad that my family is far from that area.&nbsp; If you guys still have family in the Philippines who happen to live close to the volcano, I hope they are well.&nbsp; You might try to get in touch with them just to make sure everything is okay.

      You're right..&nbsp; There was a small reference to the video store..&nbsp; But for the most part everything happened at the convenience store.&nbsp; As far as level of achievement, though, they're all the same to me.&nbsp; Convenience store, video store..&nbsp; You can even throw in fast food joints, if you want to.    " It's not the size of the diamond that matters; it's the size of the heart of the giver. "&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; I couldn't have put it any better !     And YOU ARE going to send me a picture to but next to your name !     If anyone is wondering why this post is at four in the freakin' morning..&nbsp; I'm having one of those days again..&nbsp; I woke up, crying, from a really bad dream and now I'm afraid to go back to sleep.

      Weddings, marriages, engagements, brides maids, grooms men....ACK! I have set perception. I see the topic of wedding everywhere: videos, on TV, men's confessions of propsosal jitters on the web, people talking about their sisters getting married in online diaries, etc. I'm nervous just being a bridesmaid. So far, I'm the only person who volunteered to help the maid of honor with the bridal shower. My sister had the most difficult time finding fabric for the bridesmaid dresses. She had to deal with so much rudeness at the fabric store, and the other store she went to got robbed. Speaking of engagement rings, my sister's was a half carat in a platinum ring. My mom estimates a thousand. My engagement ring was cubic zirconium (sp?). No one noticed, not even me. My ex-fiance admitted it to me years after the fact.      Vince, I can empathize with your situation. I would be nervous too. Then again, I don't have any pressure to propose to anyone soon. Last time I suggested marriage to my significant other--she kinda laughed. Anyway, Vince don't worry. I'm sure she'll be happy with whatever you give her simply because it's coming from  you and it's you she loves. Well, that and the fact that she would probably be so excited about your proposal she would overlook the size. It's not the size of the diamond that matters; it's the size of the heart of the giver.      Ching, I was hoping you would narrow it down for me--otherwise a blurb can easily become a long meandering personal essay. *sigh* oh well. I'll think of something. I bet you are dying for a photo of me. LOL tough titties...ain't gonna happen.      Regarding OD, happy reading, Ching. Some of it maybe redundant cuz you already know my life story; you can skip those entries if you want. As for the rest of you, if you want my diarist name, just send me an e-mail at gleetv@yahoo.com (those who write why they need to read my drivel will get the quickest response).      I heard Berlin and Depeche Mode were gonna be in the Bay Area. Maybe they already played. I cannot keep up with everything.      A video store? I thought Clerks took place in a convenience store, at least that's how I remember it. I'm going to have to rent it again. When I first saw it, I was watching it with the sexiest guy who was not the least interested with me much to my frustration and chagrin.

      I got the email, Glee ! &nbsp; Printed some entries to read already..&nbsp; The info that you were asking about is on my previous post.&nbsp; As far as what I want on your blurbs..&nbsp; You all have total creative freedom.&nbsp; Write/say whatever you don't mind the rest of the world knowing about you !     We didn't have any money, Net, so my engagement ring cost hardly anything..&nbsp; I cherish it nonetheless.&nbsp; To me, it's the thought that counts..&nbsp; Besides, I wasn't even expecting an engagement ring at all..&nbsp; So it was a pleasant surprise.    Brian used to work at a video store ! &nbsp; That's probably one of the reasons that he enjoyed  Clerks  so much.

      I have been so depressed lately.  Been worrying about popping the question to Dot.  I has dawned to me that my sister is getting married in a few weeks and this is putting some pressure to me about propossing to Dot.  In all my wonder years, I have been told to set the example, and now sister is showing me a thing or two. Im the eldest of all my siblings and I should be setting examples!  Augh!! Good Grief!!  Whats a man suppose to do?  Dot has also been hinting that she prefers an engagement ring that's worth ten grand!! Looking at my money market account, if I withdraw ten grand that leaves me with nothing.  You are the weakest link, goodbye.    My branch manager now is also putting the pressure on me and my co-worker Mike.  We have to set the example to the rest of the crew.  Either shape up or ship out! he says.  Well, Paul, I say to myself, If you really want to make a difference, why dont you do it?  Note to self... Getting too personal on Blogger.  Just keep it to yourself and hit the stairmaster in the gym....     ~NET    PS Yet to see Final Fantasy.  I will give my review later  this week.  CLerkS was unusual but if you dont get the sarcasm, try thinking of yourself working in a video store with nothing else to do.  I think it shows the realism of people that I know.

      I read about  Hedwig and the Angry Inch  in last month's (actually the July one, I'm thinking last month because I already have the August issue) Elle magazine.&nbsp; It got rave reviews.&nbsp; Brian and I both want to see it, but I will doubt that we will be so lucky considering  where  we live.&nbsp; It probably won't make it to the theaters here, so we will have to wait for it to come out on DVD rentals.

      I watched all four movies you mentioned. I like them all with the exception of Clerks. I only liked the cadence of the banter of one of the clerks, and, yes, those scenes are unforgettable. But I didn't think it was funny--just weird.      Charlie's Angels was indeed goofy. I thought it was funny. I also loved the soundtrack cuz the music reminded me of my youth. I can't believe I used to listen to Motley Crue. I also love dance movies. Gladys has the Save the Last Dance DVD. We love the audition scene (the music for that was great! the R&B mixed with the orchestra music--nice blend of classical and soul).  I even watched an Australian foreign film about a ballroom dancer who wanted to win a tournament so badly and a Japanese foreign film about a man who took ballroom dance because he was lonely. Yes, I'm corny.      I could not send you an URL with my section if I wanted to. The only way you can read it is if you press "random" and by luck you find it OR you know my dairist name OR you know the age I put down OR you know the location I put down OR you know the name of my diary OR they feature it on the "recent entries" OR I'm the Editor's Choice (most unlikely).

       Mall Rats  is good.&nbsp; It flopped on the box office when it came out and the critics hated it, but Brian and I are big Kevin Smith fans..&nbsp; We've seen each and every one in that series:  Clerks ,  Mall Rats ,  Chasing Amy  and  Dogma .&nbsp; It all kind of ties in with various references in the movie.&nbsp; I even got Brian the comic book,  Chasing Dogma , that tells how Silent Bob and Jay got from where they were in  Chasing Amy  to the spot where they just happened to be in  Dogma .     Charlie's Angels  was really goofy.&nbsp; One shouldn't take it seriously..&nbsp; A lot of people who do, end up thinking it's retarded..&nbsp; It was meant to be a funny movie (to me, anyhow).&nbsp; I thought it was funny ! &nbsp; One of my favorite parts is the dream dance sequence.&nbsp; I'm really into dancing movies:  Save the Last Dance ,  Dance With Me , etc.&nbsp; I loved that dress ! &nbsp; I actually got myself some underoos(I can't wear them now because they shrank), just because they looked cute on Cameron Diaz ! &nbsp; You all know how impressionable I am !     I want the URL to get to  your  section of opendiary !!! &nbsp; Come on, Glee !

      I finally saw Final Fantasy yesterday. WOW! The animation was great! Talk about detail--every strand of hair, every wrinkle. The captain looked like Ben Affleck (sp?) though.      Guy Pearce stars in Memento. I don't know who he is so I don't know if that if information would be of any help. Still, go see it!      My sister Gladys bought many DVDS which I had the opportunity to view at least a few. Let's see...    Mall Rats   Power Puff Girls   Cinema Paradiso (excellent! Don't watch the dub in English. The Italian priest sounded like he was a Jewish rabbi from NYC.)   Camille Claudel (also, excellent)  Charlie's Angels (entertaining. I also liked the special segment in which they described their training for the martial arts stunts.)   Say Anything ( i love this movie! I just like John Cussack sp?--I cannot spell anyone's names lately)     I missed Dido when she played in the Shoreline Amphitheatre in the South Bay Area. I decided not to go, but sometimes I feel like kicking myself for not going. I did go to Ani DiFranco in Berkeley, which is only 30 minutes drive from my home city. This was the fifth Ani concert I've seen. She opts for smaller venues than the collesiums and giant stadiums. She is very funny and personable when she talks to the crowd. She is very experimental with her music. For example, a spokenword piece in her CD can be incredibly rocked out in one concert or have a funky bassline in the next concert. Her older songs don't have a brass section, but in a concert she would have trumpet players and other horns playing. Her roots are in folk music--the grassroots political music. If it weren't for her blend of rock, R&B, funk, and jazz  combined with lyrics that either captured the complexities of love relationships, fought against big music industry, and constantly questioned the governement; well, I'd just say "another dyke with a guitar--yech, phooey!" Now, I see a mighty mite on stage who challenged the big guns on her own terms and won.

      Whatever you do, do not watch the English dubbed version on  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon .&nbsp; It's hard to take the film seriously with the semi-acceptable English dubbing.&nbsp; The translations are so raw, it ends up sounding silly.&nbsp; After watching it dubbed, I appreciated that they showed the subtitled version of the film in the theaters.

        Our rentals lately:   Fantasia 2000  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon   and then we bought a bunch of used rentals:   After Hours  A Boy and His Dog  Peggy Sue Got Married  After the Fox   ...and one more I can't remember right now.  For a while, we were buying up movies all over the place - but they really need to be   re  watchable.  We've got a bunch of stuff we'll probably never watch again:   Bird on the Wire  Vacation  His Girl Friday  Liebestraume  The Fisher King   etc.   All the stuff we bought this time hits the rewatch mark.  And  Fantasia 2000 , though not as good as the 1940 one, is certainly one worth seeing a few times.   Crouching , though?  Probably not.  Daf

      I haven't been to any good concerts lately..&nbsp; I love both Sheryl Crow and Stevie Nicks..&nbsp; That must have been an amazing show ! &nbsp; I've never seen either of them perform live.&nbsp;  I can imagine what it must've been like, though..&nbsp; Noone special has been through Wichita recently.&nbsp; Vanilla Ice (yck ! ) performed at Rita's just a couple of days ago.&nbsp; I'm not that desperate to go to a concert.&nbsp; So I passed.&nbsp; The last concert Brian and I went to was a while back..&nbsp; Godsmack, Stained, Cold and Systematic.    How does everyone like the new layout?&nbsp; I forget who designed it, but it was one of the winning entries in Blogger's Template Design Contest.&nbsp; By the way, you all need to give me blurbs about you that we can put on the members column to the right..&nbsp; It's kind of bare right now.

        Note - tried posting this yesterday - firewall probs.  Here goes again...    Present!      I should be a grandfather by next week... Jessica's as big as a house.      Work's a bitch - mandatory overtime now through September. Found out today that we're rehiring a friend of mine (who left for greener pastures, then got laid off), and she'll be working for me. So that's cool.      I don't wanna know my score. It's one of the few things ALL the voices in my head agree on. &lt;g&gt;      Two concerts in the last two weeks - Stevie Nicks with Sheryl Crow (opening act Jeffrey Gaines), and Wynonna and her band. Stevie was Stevie - no surprises, really - good band, fun crowd, she and Sheryl work real well together. Wynonna was excellent! Covered a lot of different styles - blues, R&amp;B, rock, gospel, pop-jazz, contemporary Cbristian- not really much country, though there's this &quot;country feel&quot; that's different from other styles (more emphasis on 1 &amp; 3, backbeat a little stiffer - if you care about that stuff) - and that was prevalent throughout. She sang covers of Fab Thunderbirds, Avalon, Joni Mitchell. Had a gospel trio behind her that was excellent, plus a real good band.      Either show's worth checking out. Sheryl Crow's coming back to Michigan without Stevie in a couple of weeks - I love her stuff, but her voice isn't all there live (not just the show we saw - I heard a live CD later, had the same impression). So we'll probably skip it.      Anyone else see any good concerts?      Daf (= Jay)

      Thank you for clarifying that for me. You would think I would know who Perverse Angel  and Brian are by now, wouldn't you? hee. Brian used to be Dark Angel. A bit of Ching trivia.      I cannot view the picture. Your link leads me to a page that says "Forbidden." It says I need a "local referer." I have no idea what that is.      I heard that Final Fantasy had some really bad scriptwriting in terms of dialogue. But, like you, I'm really interested in the animation. I'm gonna grab the bargain matinee tomorrow.      If you must know what has been keeping me busy, I joined a diary community at www.opendiary.com. If you are nice, maybe I'll give you my diarist name.

      Daf = Jay.&nbsp;  Perverse Angel = Cherrie = Ching.&nbsp;   Ching + Brian = Together Forever.    I'd forgotten how much I love doing social math.&nbsp;  I can't see the picture either.&nbsp; I know what the problem is, though..&nbsp; That image is stored on the Yahoo! server.&nbsp; Yahoo! and GeoCities no longer allow you to link to anything stored on their servers.&nbsp; You can see it as long as you go directly to the source, or it's linked from a website on Yahoo! or GeoCities.&nbsp;  urlLink Click here  if want to see the photo.     Final Fantasy  is great ! &nbsp; You have to go see it.&nbsp; It's the future of animated films.

      Please don't hold those results against me; those ARE my good qualities. just kiddin'      No, no, no. We should NOT have this constitutional amendment that bans same-sex marriage. I was just trying so hard to sound impartial earlier  just so people could check out the issue and the site themselves. However, I'm not impartial. If this amendment passes, it will be part of the U.S. Constitution thus nullifying any state or local laws that permit same-sex marriage or civil unions--some say it may have a negative impact on domestic partnership rights/benefits. Married couples have benefits: health insurance, medical visitation rights, medical decisions involving a sick spouse, custody rights, adoption rights, inheritance/possessions, etc. Same-sex partners cannot have those rights without having a legal union to legitamize their relationship. Okay, I'm done with my ranting and raving.     Hi, Ching, I'm glad the party went well. You flips sure know how to party in Wichita. My girlfriend is Vietnamese, and she observed Filipino families are fun-loving people. I have yet to see FINAL FANTASY.       I have never seen a VCD before. I have seen a VCR/5-disc changer DVD player and a FM radio/VCR/TV. So, once again I'm baffled. Hmmm...speaking of baffled. I cannot view the pic with Dot. Probably something wrong with my computer. *sigh* oh well. I feel like such an airhead. I cannot keep your names straight. Net = Vince, right?  Net + Dot, right? Daf ? Where is Daf?     ARGH! I can't think straight!

This was taken a year ago.       VCD's can be played on DVD players if you purchased the combination vcd/cd/dvd player.  I bought mine at Best Buys.  Anyone going to the Philippines? I wants me some VCD's

      Friday the 13th came and went without any glitches.&nbsp; We saw  Final Fantasy  yesterday afternoon.&nbsp; Has anybody else seen it?&nbsp; Pretty amazing animation ~~ you can see strands of hair ! &nbsp; The characters looked so real ! &nbsp; It more like a movie-movie, instead of an animated film.&nbsp; The story was okay.&nbsp; Not really all that spectacular, but the spectacular job they did on the animation made up for it (to me, anyhow).    We (Dave, Donna, Brian and I) attended Logan's birthday party at my parents house last night.&nbsp; There were a lot of guests.&nbsp; Logan came away with so much stuff ! &nbsp; He is going to be one spoiled little boy.&nbsp; I can already see it ! &nbsp; The rocking horse was a big hit ! &nbsp; Logan loved it ! &nbsp; I was really pleased about that.    Mom is having a second party for those who were unable to attend Friday night on Sunday.&nbsp; That's how it is here in Wichita.&nbsp; The members of the Filipino community are so sensitive.&nbsp; You have to make everyone happy.&nbsp; No one must feel left out.&nbsp; Otherwise, you're done for !

         Ballers... Shot Callers;  Bloggers... Web Cloggers.  Works for my, my peeps.  Okay, I'll stop now.  Used to drive me crazy when Dad would try to use "groovy" in a sentence, or wear bellbottoms.  My new copy of Acid (v. 3.0) is here!

      That's pretty funny, Glee !     Well..&nbsp; Well..&nbsp; Well..&nbsp; Guess who can't sleep?&nbsp; You guessed it ! &nbsp; I've been tossing and turning all night.&nbsp; I'm actually amazed that I didn't wake Brian up as I got off the bed.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't wake up from the keyboard noise.&nbsp; He's kind of a light sleeper.&nbsp; Thank God that the computer is now in a different room !     I've got lots of stuff planned for today.&nbsp; Two loads of laundry, one load of Dryel, dishes (hopefully only one load), got to the bank to do a change of address (yes, I've been procrastinating), pick up paycheck and book from Pat (lady on my team at work) to Jodi Anderson (lady on Brian's team at his work that used to work at Spiegel) that I left at work (I forgot it as I was leaving the other day and I forgot it again yesterday ~~> Can anyone say Gingkoba?), go to Walmart to get refill on birth control, stop by Brian's work to bring the previously mentioned book (if I remember), watch  Thirteen Days  with Brian, go to Brian's parents' house to help assemble Logan's present and for supper, meet Misty (with new dance partner, Jorge) at swing club, return movies ( Monkey Bone ,  Down to Earth  and  Thirteen Days  ~~> I'm telling you, between movie rentals and new movies, Brian and I watch about five movies a week ! )..&nbsp; I think that's everything.&nbsp; As forgetful as I am, I can't help but feel like I omitted something.&nbsp; Oh, well..&nbsp; Perhaps it wasn't  that  important.

      Ani rocked! I had to go to the concert all by my lonsesome, but I still had fun.   Jann Arden appeared on the Regis and Kelly show and she said a blonde joke: "There are two blondes, each one on the other side of the street. One blonde yelled, 'How do I get to the other side?' The other blonde responded, 'You ARE on the other side.'"

      I am always having a hard time keeping up with your contact info. Thanks for the new e-mail addresses. I'm going to the Ani DiFranco concert tonight1 Yay! I showed my sister the photos from the archives of one of your other blogger groups--SMEAGHE TODAY maybe it. (What does SMEAGHE stand for?) You probably beat me in chess too. I might have a chance with Scrabble. However, my SAT vocabulary might not help me. I need those obscure short words to put me in the lead, and that's what I lack. But I kick gluteus maximus when it comes to air hockey and pinball. How do I create line breaks with this thing so my paragraphs don't  run together into one?

      I really like "Web Cloggers," too ! &nbsp; I submitted our blog to BlogHop already ~~ under that name.    Yes, Brian and I bought a Scrabble set recently.&nbsp; He got tired of me beating him at Chess ! &nbsp; Ha.&nbsp; Ha.&nbsp; We would've played Monopoly, but Brian's grandma hates it.&nbsp; I asked her once, "Why?&nbsp; But I heard that you're so good at it ! "&nbsp; She finds it boring because she always wins.    I have some close up shots of my hair from the back and from the side.&nbsp; They're in the archives of SMEAGHE TODAY.&nbsp; Is that where your sister saw it?&nbsp; Or is she just basing her opinion on the portrait below?&nbsp; The portrait really doesn't do it justice.&nbsp; I loved what the hair stylist did to my hair !     The email address that you should use is  ching@digitalrice.com  or  ching@liquid2k.com .&nbsp; Brian and I are thinking of getting a cable modem.&nbsp; We are sick of our slow-ass connection.&nbsp; I think, with his promotion and everything, we'll be able to wing it.  =)

      Okay, okay, The Spark people are the closest to the truth than I like to admit. I'm the one in denial. I think Ching has some idea about my slut ranking. I told her the number on my tally sheet, and she was in some sorta shock. I just think it's weird that I would be gayer than the typical lesbian. I thought it would be more likee I'm straighther than the typical lesbian. Some people (including my girlfriend) think I walk like a guy and think like a guy. And I feel like I'm in drag in a dress.    Speaking of dresses, I'm going to be one of the nine bridesmaids at my younger sister's wedding. My sister got engaged in April on her birthday. When will I get married? When it becomes legal in California. BTW, my sister really liked your hairdo for the Filipino ball, and she and I never saw a dark barong before.    I did not see fireworks, but I heard them go off. Then again, they sounded like gun shots so I stayed at home that night. I think the only highlight of the 4th of July is having a long lost friend drop by and she came out to me.    What's with the Scrabble games, Ching? You just bought a new set? When my girlfriend visited me, we played Monopoly four times in a two week period. Before I met her, I would play one Monopoly game every decade or so. I really believe you get to see the true colors of person once you play Monopoly with them. I watched my sweet, innocent girlfriend turn into a greedy, ambitious, little cheater.   The movies I saw this summer were Shrek and Tomb Raider. Both movies I enjoyed immensely. My sister and her fiance were disappointed with A.I. to say the least. He said, "Speilberg owes me 8 bucks." I've been wanting to watch Memento for a while now. And I can't wait for Final Fantasy.    Ching, what is your main e-mail address?   I thing Web Cloggers is the best name (that I suggested--I'm sure someone else could come up with something better). It goes with  your slogan about the basis of your chingay sites.

          Love is always a wonderful thing [blush].   I took the gender test - 86% male - and there weren't even any questions about fantasy baseball!  Also took the sex text - it says one more person, and I'll be in love.   I really only see that happening if (a) Kim finally gets sick of my sh*t, or (b) I outlive her.   I quit at two tests - they block the spark from here - I had to go through SafeWeb to get there.   Daf

        This is our portrait, taken at the 14th Annual Filipino Dinner-Dance.&nbsp; We both look stiff, but it looks great considering the photographer only took one shot. ;-)    I saw  What Women Want  in the theatres with Brian when it first came out.&nbsp; It was actually his idea.&nbsp; Looking back, I'm not so surprised that  urlLink TheSpark.com  guessed he was a woman.&nbsp; I really like it.&nbsp; It was pretty funny.&nbsp; We were actually contemplating on buying the DVD the last time we were at Hollywood Video.&nbsp; They're having a huge sale.    &gt;&gt; and then, um, well, you know...      We did some of that last night, too ! &nbsp;  *giggles*&nbsp; It was make up for the other day.&nbsp; I was being really moody and grumpy (my only guess is that it was PMS, but it came kind of early).&nbsp; Everything was pissing me off.&nbsp; We were over at Brian's parents' house.&nbsp; We were sitting in our lawn chairs on the driveway watching the neighbors blow up fireworks.&nbsp; I was feeling neglected so I ignored him the rest of the evening..&nbsp; But we made up already.  =)     By the way,  urlLink TheSpark.com  says that I am 33% gay: 2% gayer than average.

         Web Cloggers sounds good !   Our 4th of July:  Played a 9am mass.  Kim was supposed to come, but has been having food reaction problems lately.  So she stayed home, and we canceled a long-distance shopping trip we had planned.  Did some shopping closer to home, rented  What Women Want  (pretty good, not great), did some gardening, surfed a little, tweaked a couple of songs I'd been working on (maybe I'll post an mp3 when they're closer to ready).  I drop my vegetarian routine for major holidays - so we did some burgers on the barbie, had a few beers, watched our movie, and then, um, well, you know...  Didn't see our kids all day!  Sad in a way, but made for a peaceful day.  Our counselor said (Wednesday night) that she doesn't think we need to come anymore - we worked through the "partnership" issues, sounds like we're to a point where we can handle whatever curves life (and especially life in the form of the kids) throws at us next.  Knock on wood, the garden actually looks good this year - first time!  We put down some really good soil this year, I'm sure that helped.  Daf

      I kind of like  Web Cloggers , but we'll leave it open for other suggestions.&nbsp; If there are no other suggestions that are better than  Web Cloggers  by the 20th of this month then that will be the name of our blog.&nbsp; What do you guys think?    Speaking of tests, Brian took the Gender Test and  urlLink TheSpark  said he was a woman.&nbsp; 83% sure, to boot ! &nbsp; I took the test and it guessed me to be a woman also.&nbsp; So basically, Brian and I are a lesbian couple.&nbsp; Kidding ! &nbsp; It's really not that accurate I suppose.&nbsp; Perhaps not enough people have taken the test.    We had a barbecue at our house yesterday to celebrate the Fourth of July.&nbsp; It was a small one.&nbsp; We were expecting just Brian's parents, Brian and I.&nbsp; Brian's mom canceled because she wasn't feeling good.&nbsp; Earlier that afternoon we (Donna, Dave, Kevin, Brian and I) had all gone to watch  A.I.  (it reminded me of  Bicentennial Man , but I liked  Bicentennial Man  better because it actually made me cry ~~ Brian says  A.I.  would've made me cry, I just wasn't in the mood for it).&nbsp; I think the heat may have gotten to her.&nbsp; It was really hot out yesterday.&nbsp; It was affecting my mood: I was being sorta grumpy.    Instead, Brian's granparents (Clark and Betty) and his dad came.&nbsp; Brian grilled some pork chops and we had corn on the cob and mashed potatoes.&nbsp; We also had some cantaloupe and watermelon.&nbsp; Brian and Dave (his dad) opted to skip the fruits and go for Nest&eacute; Crunch ice cream bars instead.&nbsp; Dinner was really delicious.&nbsp; Brian and I are getting good use out of his grill.&nbsp; I don't regret buying it for him.    We played a game of Scrabble to kill time because it was still bright outside.&nbsp; I won.&nbsp; After Scrabble it was dark enough to start blowing up fireworks.&nbsp; We had quite a few: mostly sparklers, nothing illegal (except for the free firecrackers that the store was giving away).&nbsp; It was a lot of fun.&nbsp; I think Brian's grandparents really enjoyed themselves.&nbsp; How did you guys spend your holiday?

      Hi, everyone! I hope everyone enjoyed their 4th of July. I received a surprised visit from a friend.  My summer has a running theme: getting reacquainted with friends. BTW, Ching, thank you for the invitation. I'm new to this so I hope it works out.  I revisited the spark.com website. I remember taking the purity test a months ago, but I cannot remember my score. I scored 52% slutty on the slut test (with the worldwide average being 46%). For the Gay Test I'm 56% gay (the typical lesbian is 39%). And according to spark's Gender Test, statistically my gender is male. Spark is inaccurate. And I think the people who run that site dislike Canadians.  Names? Web Cloggers, Net Hoggers, Ching's Loggers

      It's not your fault, Daf.&nbsp; Your &lt;TAGS&gt; were correct.&nbsp; Yahoo! and GeoCities just don't like to share their non-HTML content.&nbsp; It does not allow external hosts to access image and sound files.&nbsp; Sorry !     In case I forget:  Happy Fourth of July!     By the way, you guys need to help me come up with a name for our 'blog.

          Yahoo has all kinds of fantasy sports, Ching - I think I saw about 30 on their list.  Baseball's the only one that trips my trigger, though.    Hey, I forgot to tell you - AIM magazine (a publication of World Library Press, who makes the little missalettes that you see in a bunch of Catholic churches) wants me to write an article about my teen choir.  1500 words, $250.  I'm excited and nervous - probably why I haven't written it yet, or even started.  Deadline's a couple of months from now, so there's plenty of time (famous last words?).   As far as my "published composer" status, that still hasn't hasppened yet, either - contract's signed, but no other info.  GIA (the publisher) told me it could be 18 months - it's been 16 so far.    See ya,    Daf

      Jen is doing okay, Pia.&nbsp; She has her own place (a crummy apartment with no air-conditioning unit only God knows where -- she gave Mom the address after she moved there, but Mom wasn't paying attention or didn't care, probably a little of both, so we don't know where it is).&nbsp; Mom was pretty upset and Dad was really angry at first, but they got over it.&nbsp; Jen has been pulling antics like these ever since I can remember.&nbsp; Mom and Dad are used to it now, sad to say.&nbsp; Matt takes care of Logan for the most part.&nbsp; Mom and Karen, Matt's mom, take turns baby-sitting throughout the week.    Your fantasy baseball team sounds interesting, Daf.&nbsp; I'm glad that it's doing well.&nbsp; I'm not much of a sports fan, much less a baseball fan.&nbsp; I don't know what anything is.&nbsp; It's interesting, though ! &nbsp; Don't they have fantasy football and fantasy basketball, too?

      Gosh Ching! What happened to Jen?! From the way it sounded, it seemed inevitable that she and Matt would break up. So who has the baby now? I hope they are both okay. I can only imagine how horrible your parents feel. It is difficult when you still have to worry about your grown children.  Anyhoo goodluck! I hope you had a chance to talk to her. Maybe you can talk some sense into her.

          My Fantasy Life      Well, there are fantasies, and there are fantasies.  But here's a surprise one for me - fantasy baseball.    A 'net acquaintance of mine was putting a league together, and asked me to join.  I spend way too much time surfing anyhow, and wanted to tell him "no".  But baseball was always "my" sport, so I decided to give it a try.    When I was a kid, we used to play something like this - my best friend Bobby had a board game with a bunch of circular "cards" with a big hole in the middle.  Around the outside of the circle was the player's name, accompanied by lines marking off a pie graph version of his stats.  So, for example, Mickey Mantle would have a big section of home runs, along with a HUGE slice for strikeouts whereas PeeWee Reese had a much smaller homer slice, but also a lot fewer strikeouts, and bigger slices for singles and doubles.  I forget the name of THAT game - it certainly didn't have the word "fantasy" in it.    Fast forward 35 years.  Nobody has games with spinners anymore - there's probably even an electronic version of Hi-Ho-CherryO - and we're not stuck with stats-from-the-past.  So fantasy baseball, or at least this flavor, involves putting a team together, and then pulling their stats every night - best stats wins - but it's the league founder who determines the points.  So he decided, for example,  that you don't get anything for being walked, and that pitchers don't lose anything for taking a loss or allowing runs.    So at first, I had no idea who to draft - so I went for an all-Hispanic/Asian team.  Because of the way the draft went, I didn't get all my picks, but had what I thought was a pretty good team.  Pretty soon, though, I was "floundering" (ironic, in that "Flounders" was the name of my team) around 6th or 7th place, out of a league of 8 teams.  So something had to change.      Nobody had drafted any rookies, so I went out and got the hot ones.  and a few cold-career/hot-season guys.  But I couldn't get past 6th place.    But then I got the secret - it was the starting pitchers.  You get points for innings pitched, strikeouts, wins, complete games, shutouts.  But you only get 3 starting pitcher slots, plus 2 relievers and 3 utility pitchers.  Starters only pitch every 5 days or so - so how do you maximize your pitchers' innings?  You (1) load your bench with starters, and (2) make as many of your guys combined relievers / starters as possible.  (1) lets you swap scheduled starters in every time it's their turn - this is way more productive than keeping hitters on the bench - 'cos you're hoping your hitters are playing every day anyhow.  (2)  Lets you put any pitcher anywhere - so you can have a scheduled starter in a reliever's spot.  Guys with this designation (combined starter / reliever) tend to be last year's relievers, who've been promoted to this year's starters.    So you're thinking, "nice theory, Daf, but how does it play out?"  It took about 4 weeks, maybe 5,  to move from 6th place to first.  The Flounders are  smokin' !  Two weeks in first place, and pulling away.    This is just so cool, 'cos I always wanted to win at baseball, and never could.  First baseman, average glove, no hit.  Even in my old "spinner" game, I usually lost, 'cos Bobby was such a baseball geek.    So, for the moment anyway, the Flounders rule!  All the rest of you teams (especially the naughtybeavers, for picking such a tasteless and obvious name), eat Flounder dust!   Daf

        Hey April...  ...RUN.  Don't just walk away.  RUN.     The right guy is worth waiting for.  Try to find a grown-up, though.  Grownup is more a state of mind than an age - you can tell if they're grown-ups because  (1)  they know that they can't have a healthy relationship if Mom's still number 1 ("Dr. Freud!  Paging Dr. Freud!  Your patient is ready!");   (2)  They actually  want  to have a healthy relationship; and  (3)  They won't resort to name-calling.  Whatever a "Puta" is.  Sounds like something less than a compliment.   And how did I wind up being the only one here who doesn't know Tagalog?  Daf

       ching, here's a very long entry. you wanted me to elaborate, rite? i pulled it from my diary.   AUGUST 5, SAT  louie broke up with me! yea, for real.... he was constantly confusing me on whether he really loved me or maybee he thought he loved me crap so, the day before our TWO YEAR-SEVEN MONS anniv we fought on the fone. both of us have been working alot, seeing less of each other, and frankly, we have been sooo happy and not fighting at all  after some silly statements, at the end he said that i was a bitch. i told him he did not mean it...and that he doesnt knoe what he's saying. in restrospect, i think he heard me saying that he couldnot speak english words well that wasnt what i meant i told him i was "bitchin"--nangungulit....not a bitch! i was hurt  hmm....sometimes even i dont say sum words well butt, the point is...he kept saying it, and  he ended up telling me that the reason why my father left mah mom was because of me.....a bitch! he kept calling me PUTA....PUTA.... he wouldnt stop!!! so, i made a remark, bent on revenge: i told him not to compare me to his mother.   his mom is really a prostitute....she asks money in return for sex....up to now, here in htown  he told me that his mother will always be first in his heart and his life. why??? dont really ask me, because ive been asking myself that how can you love someone that try to kill you even before you were born? and up to now? yea.....malas ko ano. so, he did not talk to me for like five days. last nite, we went out tho watched rush hour 2 nothing happened and it was sad to be next to each other without holding hands or sharing a coke see, i know u probably calling me stupid for even setting up myself to a never-ending fall but, gurl, i wanted to see him baddddd to prove whether he loves me still or he has definitely deleted me out of his life and what to do with the car. i lent him my name...my credit. i know....mistake ***sigh*** well.... i failed to get any of those at least he's talking to me and u kno, i havent cried as much that's a first. u wanna knoe another one? well, i havent begg him to come back not once i did tell him tho that cool off to me means were still together just sorting things out but he wanted a break up and to date other girls...play the field... be free... why are guys like that? i know we're still young and that's why i never told him no... because if we ended up together, i wouldn't be blamed for him missing out on anything. i sabe to him that i will wait for him however; IF he goes and messes with another then he should not even try to woe me but tell me to stop hoping he promised lets just hope that this is the one he keeps  at least this butt, i pray to GOD that  he does not regret or pay for his decisions bec im starting to think that i can live my life without him   ***LAKE SUMMERViLLE*** AUG. 25  to make ammends for not taking me to the  FRiO RiVER with him, LOUiE invited me to go jet-skiing with his bball crew. i went.. it was weird. LOUiE & i were acting as if we were a couple... well, it was whenever he felt like i mattered. he left me to fend for myself many a times. i survived..... he came close to me, held my hand, kissed me, and all that. butt when he started groping my body, i almost slapped his face! like the numbness i felt, my face showed no emotions with each thrusting sexual move he tried to enact underwater.... making rude comments on whether we never did it at a lake or if i missed his company in my bed. i told him we already broke up, di ba??? and he would ignore me.   enihow, he proceeded to be lovey-dopey with me. i played along.... thinking maybee i can hurt him in his own game. he told me that he had lots of girlfriends... but i am his GiRL forever.   i got bruised and beaten-up bad because LOUiE thought he was an experienced jet-skier. he even enraged LiN --one of the nice gurls who was responsible and spent money on the trip-- we ended up stuck in the middle of the lake. LOUiE rode away....left LiN & i to be dragged-off to shore. my arms hurt and i drank lake water..... awful!!!! then he tells us, that when we were cursing his name, as we were being pulled by his careless driving, he got hurt. ***scoff*** um.....i'm so sorry, i'd forgotten how sensitive he was.   get this.... he will marry me eventually. if and when he forgives me, he'll decide to take me back!!! aite.....that was the last straw. i am going to make this bad boi bleed. i will finaLee bee the bitch he tells everybody i am, and teach him one of life's lessons. "be humble."   it bothered me that the people there where being misled... but it turns out, that i was the one that was being fooled. they said: "mabait ka pala. you're nice naman." sooo....what has LOUiE been telling them? this weak wolf in sheep's clothing confused the hell out of mah mind!! in front of people, he's exactly like his brother MiCHAEL, all angelically good, but depressingly rotting of evil inside. ***scoff*** humff, he had the audacity to force me to drive home. i said i couldnt because if i opened mah legs i would have a major accident. he said that i was a problem. that he wouldn't have driven if i was not there, that this is the last time he would aske me out. um.....missing something here!!! i DID NOT ask him to take me with him. and he does not have the power to make me feel low. i told him that he was pathetic to even play-off being all macho and respected. he was neither.

      April, it depends on the nature of the break up.&nbsp; If YOU screwed up, then YOU have to take him back..&nbsp; If HE cheated on YOU, then you're not obligated to take him back.&nbsp; If the break up was over something really petty, then it's worth taking the time to work things out.&nbsp; Brian and I always work things out.&nbsp; He doesn't believe in running away from your problems.&nbsp; He doesn't believe in just throwing all that you have worked for away..&nbsp; Like I said, it depends on the circumstances.&nbsp; I am not going to pry, but you are welcome to elaborate on your situation..&nbsp; Perhaps then we will be able to give you more suitable advice.

Yesterdy was my 13th day of working straight, and having the weekend off does not justify my having a b*tchiE manager. im happee cause you guys are happee ('o',)

      I agree with everyone's advice.&nbsp; Brian and I have both had our share of failed relationships.&nbsp; The key is to learn from each experience and grow as a person.&nbsp; Stay positive..&nbsp; Don't dwell on the negative.&nbsp; Keep yourself busy.&nbsp; And when you least expect it, the right person will come along.

      Hi, April! I have to agree with Daf's "stuff that'll heal the hurt" list. I heard a story about a man who asked his mother, "How can I find Miss Right?" His mother replied, "Become Mr. Right."    You can take this opportunity to become a better you or enjoy the aspects of yourself or your life your fiancee could not appreciate. You now have more free time to be with friends and family. You now have more time for hobbies and activities. You can try something new, learn something new, do something new.      Become Ms. Right...Date Yourself....And Be Good to Yourself.

      That's a beautiful story, Vince !     By the way, our barbecue was a blast..&nbsp; Except Richard lost his keys..&nbsp; It was about 1:00 AM.&nbsp; Time to leave, when Richard suddenly realizes that he doesn't have his keys on him.&nbsp; We looked everywhere: on the couch where he and Daniella had been sitting, in his car, on kitchen counter..&nbsp; We looked everywhere ! &nbsp; Then we thought maybe he left it in Jeff's (Jeff = Richard's roommate) truck because they were outside chatting earlier in the evening.    Kevin, who had stayed around also, ended up driving the three of them (Richard, Daniella and Mike = they all rode together) home.&nbsp; Brian and I strip and go to bed.&nbsp; At 2:45 AM we are sound asleep (totally) when the doorbell rings.&nbsp; I didn't even make an attempt to get up.&nbsp; Besides, I was feeling too lazy (and sleepy) to put my clothes back on.&nbsp; Brian scrambles to put his bristols (clamdiggers for men) on.&nbsp; From my half-closed eyes I get a glimpse of Mike as he walks past the door.    "What was that about," I mumble as Brian returns to the bed.&nbsp; "Richard's keys weren't in Jeff's truck," Brian tells me.&nbsp; "They're checking the yard right now."    The following day I find out that Richard had found his keys (thank, God ! ).&nbsp; It was laying in the grass out on our backyard all along ~~ where they had been rough-housing (Richard got a birthday-beating.. It's supposedly a tradition between Richard, Jeff and Mike from way back when.. The three of them went to high school together).&nbsp; Brian paid for it that day.&nbsp; He has to wake up early and be at work by 6:00 AM.&nbsp; He was late.&nbsp; He didn't get in trouble, though..&nbsp; I don't think.&nbsp; At least, I hope not.

      THE STORY OF ROSE  The first day of school our professor introduced himself and challenged us to get to know someone we didn't already know. I stood up when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady beaming up at me with a smile that lit up her entire being. She said, "Hi handsome. My name is Rose. I'm eighty-seven years old. Can I give you a hug?" I laughed and enthusiastically  responded, "Of course you can!" and she gave me a giant squeeze. "Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?" I asked. She jokingly replied, "I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married, have a couple of children, and then retire and travel." "No seriously," I asked. I was curious what may have motivated her to be taking on this challenge at her age. "I always dreamed of having a college education and now I'm getting one!" she told me. After class we walked to the student union building and shared a chocolate milkshake. We became instant friends. Every day for the next three months we would leave class together and talk nonstop. I was always mesmerized listening to this "time machine" as she shared her wisdom and experience with me. Over the course of the year Rose became a campus icon and she easily made friends wherever she went. She loved to dress up and she reveled in the attention bestowed upon her from the other students. She was living it up. At the end of the semester we invited Rose to speak at our football banquet. I'll never forget what she taught us. She was introduced and stepped up to the podium. As she began to deliver her prepared speech, she dropped all of her 3 x 5 note cards. Frustrated and a little embarrassed she leaned into the microphone and simply said, "I'm sorry I'm so jittery.  I gave up beer for Lent and this whiskey is killing me! I'll never get my speech back in order so let me just tell you what I know." As we laughed she cleared her throat and began, "We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow old because we stop playing. There are only four secrets to staying young, being happy, and achieving success. You have to laugh and find humor every day. You've got to have a dream. When you lose your dreams, you die. We have so many people walking around who are dead and don't even know it! There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up. If you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and don't do one  productive thing, you will turn twenty years old. If I am eighty-seven years old and live life to it's fullest each day to achieve my dreams, I will turn eighty-eight. Anybody can grow older. That doesn't take any talent or ability. The idea is to grow up by always finding the opportunity in change. Have no regrets. The elderly rarely have regrets for the things we did, but rather for things we did not do. The only people who fear death are those with regrets." She concluded her speech by courageously singing "The Rose." She challenged each of us to study the lyrics. At the years end Rose finished the college degree she had begun all those years ago. One week after graduation Rose died peacefully in her sleep. Over two thousand college students attended her funeral -  a tribute to the wonderful woman who taught by  example that it's never too late to be all you can possibly be.

      Barbeque!!!  I hope it doesnt turn out like the time when Homer Simpson had a bbq at his house and invited the whole town.  Which brings me to the question.  How small and quaint Springfield is that Homer can fit all the inhabitants in his small back yard.   things that make you go hmmmm...

      FROM WENCH.COM:    "It's something I've come to refer to as the Skinny Paradox. It is a situation in which a media outlet known for its copious promotion of extremely thin women, particularly celebrities and models, runs an article decrying the fact that women are expected to be skinny."  &gt;&gt;&gt;

      That's funny, Vince !!     That's a really cute photo of the baby, Daf.&nbsp; Babies are so adorable.&nbsp; Congratulations again !     What did you think of  Chasing Dogma , Glee?&nbsp;  Brian and I are looking forward to watching  Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back .&nbsp; It looks kind of silly, but we've seen all of Kevin Smith's movies so we might as well see this one, too.    GREET ME ! &nbsp; GREET ME !     August 10th marked mine and Brian's second anniversary.&nbsp; We celebrated yesterday, the 11th..&nbsp; He was all secretive about what he had planned for us for the whole day.&nbsp; Our first activity was one-hour, full-body massages for the two of us at Sveta's.&nbsp; After that we went on a picnic at Sedgwick County Park.&nbsp; We then went to see a movie of my choice (because Brian said it was my day and I got to decide everything)..  Legally Blonde .&nbsp; It's a really cute movie.&nbsp; We went home, took a shower, got cleaned up..&nbsp; Dinner was at 9:00 PM and then we went dancing at America's Pub after that.&nbsp; Brian, who usually hates dancing, danced with me all night.&nbsp; I was so happy ! &nbsp; He really made my day !

      The Seven Dwarfs visit The Vatican  The Seven Dwarfs got of the plane and were greeted by the Pope.  On their way to Luggage Claim Dopey asked the Pope: "Your Excellency, are there any midget nuns in the Vatican?"  The Pope says" Nope."  This disturbs Dopey.  "Your Highness" says Dopey, "Are there any midget nuns in Italy?"  "Im afraid not." says the Pope.  Again this disturbs Dopey  "Okay, are there any midget nuns in the world?" asks Dopey  "Afraid not" sighs the Pope.  Suddenly in the back of the pack the other six dwarfs were laughing out loud.  "What is so funny?" says the Pope? One of the dwarfs replies, "Dopey fucked a penguin, Dopey fucked a penguin."  ~Net

      I heard Kevin Smith is coming out with J & Silent Bob movie. Isn't that cool? I saw the Chasing Dogma comic book you mentioned at this really cool comic book store in Berkeley called Comic Relief. Speaking of comic books, I saw Ghost World last night. It was funny. The character Enid sorta reminds me of Daria. The movie is speckled with oddball characters and chockful of sarcastic wit.

      I was driving home late from the Melville office when all of a sudden sounds of sirens and lights flashing behind me.  I was on my cell phone.  The police officer told me to pull over.  For those of you that might not be in the know, New York State and Suffolk county has issued a cell phone ban while driving a car.  The lady officer informed me of why I was pulled over.  It didnt occur to me that they would be flagging down drivers at such a late hour - which was 1 am!  I got a summons for 175 smakaroons and a word of advice from the officer to get a hands free device.  I thanked her for her concerns and drove home.  Got home and reading e-mail I got this offer for the newest hands free device in circulation.  check it out!!!

       Express makes me feel so FAT !      I've been wanting these hip-slung, light-weight jeans from J.Crew for a while now (a while = 48 hours)..&nbsp; but the money is tight (the jeans are $68 bucks) and I can't afford to be buying everything that I want on whim.&nbsp;  Anyhow, I saw this add in a catalog for some Levi's 518 jeans..&nbsp; I was like, "Wow ! &nbsp; Only $42 dollars ! &nbsp;  This is it.&nbsp;  We're there ! "    So we go to the mall right after we drop my friend Misty off at the airport (a whole 'nother story in itself).&nbsp;  We went to both Dillard's and J.C. Penny with disappointing results.&nbsp;  The good thing was, they were cheaper at the mall.&nbsp;  At Dillard's they were only $35 and at J.C. Penny they were $29.99 ~~ shows you how much of a difference it makes going to the right store.&nbsp;  The bad news was that it didn't come in my size:&nbsp;  Levi's 518 don't come in S (short length).&nbsp;  I so wanted to cry ! &nbsp;  More and more, those $68 hip-slung jeans from J.Crew were looking good.    Brian talks me into going to Express.&nbsp; I hadn't been there in a while..&nbsp;  We try to stay away from Express because everytime I go there I end up dropping $200. This time around I only spent $60 and got a pair of jeans, a v-neck shirt, and a $25 Fast Cash coupon (for $25 off any $50 purchase) out of it.&nbsp; Not bad, considering that for $70 all I would get from J.Crew would be a pair of jeans (and a $10 gift card ~~ it's their current promotion).    I'm a 3/4 in Express jeans (in skirts, I'm still a 1/2), though ! &nbsp; Can you believe it?&nbsp;  At least J.Crew jeans make me think I'm really a size 2.&nbsp;  I still like those hip-slug, light-weight, aged denim jeans, though..&nbsp;So today, I'm going to return a pair of J.Crew jeans that I received the other day and exchange them for the new ones that I like !   =)

      TFC isnt part of the plethora of cable channels here in NYC.Its really odd that they are not since there is a lot more Filipinos here in New York and New Jersey.

       Jess named her after my sister Alison, her favorite aunt, who died 12 years ago of Hodgkins'.  I guess actually calling her Alison had a little too much emotional baggage with it, so she used a variation instead.  Works for me, but MY mom gave her a bunch of crap about it - "Baggage? Why would there be baggage?  Alison would be a wonderful name!"  And she wonders why Jess never calls her.  If I'm a PIA like that when I'm in my 70's, I sure hope someone gives me what for.  Mae is 'cos both Jess and Tom were born in May, and it had a nice ring to it.  And I was wrong - the baby is Alyssa Mae Ostrander - she took Tom's last name.  Also worked for me, though Kim didn't seem thrilled about it.  Anyhow, they're home with us now, and life is good, at least for the moment...  Daf

      Congratulations, Jay ! &nbsp; Alyssa seems to be a really popular name.&nbsp; Just recently, my new boss Carroll became a grandmother herself.&nbsp; Her daughter's baby was named Alyssa Marie.&nbsp; I really like the name Alyssa.&nbsp; I'm contemplating using the name for my first daughter, too.    By the way, have you all seen  Planet of the Apes  yet?&nbsp; It's really good.&nbsp; I liked it a lot !     P.S.&nbsp; Net, if you get TFC (which is the only way one can get TV PATROL if one doesn't reside in California) you'll be able to watch it.

      Net, here in the San Francisco Bay Area there's a tv channel that has various ethnic programming (in Chinese, Vietnamese, East Indian, Japanese, etc.). From Monday through Friday, Filipino programming comes on around early evening 5ish PM, one show that is on is called TV PATROL. My tagalog is very poor, but from what I gather it's a sensationalistic Filipino news program. It has things like miracles seen near a statue of the Virgin Mary or a feature on circumcision on young boys or some gossip on actors. But on occassion it also has news clips on government and one time I saw them show the Mayon Volcano eruption.  I don't like watching that channel because I cannot understand most of it. No one in my family is a good translator. If anyone has seen TV PATROL, correct me if I'm wrong cuz when I see/hear news from the Philippines I'm not really sure what is true and what is tabloid anymore.

       Hey Ching!   I'm still agnostic on the details.  We're trying to know the unknowable, prove the unprovable.  As (my hero) Douglas Adams pointed out, a God who requires faith of his people isn't going to provide proof, 'cos then who needs faith?  I chose Catholicism (after growing up Presbyterian) so I could worship with my wife and kids, and 'cos I like some of the Catholic music, and they invited me to play in their ensemble.  I accept our theological assertions as possible, but, of course, unprovable.   I spent a long time away from the church... 18-28, I think.  And really only active in the last 9-10 years.  It was easy to walk away, and kind of hard to come back.  Glad I did, though.   And you may have heard this before, but atheism requires as much faith as the most stringent forms of Christianity, because atheists are saying, essentially, that they believe there's nothing beyond their perception or understanding (or that they understand the things that ARE beyond their understanding well enough to know that whatever causes them, it's NOT God).   In my case, I was visited, near as I can tell, by the Holy Spirit, who gave me a fully arranged 6-part-harmony gospel-style setting of the Gloria.  I'd never composed anything even halfway good before, then all of a sudden BAM!  Woke up in the middle of the night, song wouldn't go away for 3 days, 'til I finally sat down and charted it out.  My choir (this was back before I was a director) loved it, and it brought down the house when we debuted it Christmas Eve 1996.   So it's easy to believe when something like that happens to you.  It's much tougher without any overt contact - then it REALLY takes faith.   Sorry if any of this sounded like preaching.  Not my intent.  I'm glad to see you've got an open mind about it!     And I hope your sister straightens out soon.  Her baby needs her clean and sober.   Daf

      Those are wonderful services that you mentioned.&nbsp; As you all know, I am an atheist..  But I'm leaning more and more toward agnosticism of late.&nbsp; Life is just too magnificent.&nbsp; I compare my life to the less fortunate and I just can't help but be thankful.&nbsp; I don't think that it's all a coincidence either.&nbsp; There's got to be a higher power out there watching out for me ! &nbsp; Brian, on the other hand, has always believed in God.&nbsp; He used to always tell me, "How can we be together for ever, if after you die you just turn to dust?&nbsp; I'll be in heaven all by myself ! "&nbsp; Brian doesn't go to church, but we have resolved to start attending church soon to give our future children balance.&nbsp; When they are old enough to make a decision, we will allow them to choose whether or not to continue attending.    Brian's brother Kevin recently lost his job at Sam's Club.&nbsp; He has had a difficult time finding employment because of his felony (teenagers, drug possession).&nbsp; They are working on an expungement.&nbsp; In the meantime, several potential employers have turned him down because of this.&nbsp; He began attending church again..&nbsp; A good thing.&nbsp;  We are hoping that this will help turn his life around.&nbsp; He is kind of stuck in his high school days (he is my age -- we went to the same school and belonged in the same class -- class of 96 -- we never knew each other, though).&nbsp; He even used to date girls that were still in high school (up until recently) to his parents' dismay.&nbsp; We are all hoping that he'll grow up and mature and look to the future, instead of looking back at the past.    Our siblings aren't really the creme of the crop..&nbsp; But Brian and I have both decided to still give them the privelege of being Best Man and Maid of Honor.&nbsp; To ensure that everything goes smoothly, however, we have enlisted the aid of a couple of friends.&nbsp; Richard, who is one of the groom's men will be assisting Kevin and Misty, a friend of mine from work and one of the bridesmaids, will be assisting Jen.    Speaking of Richard, he and his fianc&eacute; Daniella, came over for dinner last Sunday.&nbsp; Yes, they are now engaged ! &nbsp; Initially the plan was to gather all their friends together and propose to her on Valentine's Day (he had already purchased the ring and was just going to hang on to it until then)..&nbsp; However, in light of everything that has happened, he proposed to her on September 11, fearing that if the shit hit the fan, he might not have the opportunity to profess his undying love and affection (think  Forever Young  -- he's just as big of a movie buff as Brian and I are).&nbsp; Anyway, I cooked Menudo for us (I cook a whole bunch, too, anticipating that Jeff -- Daniella and Richard's roommate -- and his girlfriend Karen were coming).&nbsp; Karen was going to bring Flan (one of my favorite desserts), but due to some unexpected complications neither Jeff nor Karen were able to attend (long story, I may tell you later).&nbsp; We played some chess (Daniella recently learned how to play, Richard is playing even more frequently now).&nbsp; I invited Jen to come over and help eat the food.    Speaking of Jen, she arrived bawling..&nbsp; About that whole thing of being forbidden by Matthew to see their son.&nbsp; Are you ready for this?&nbsp; (You are about to hear Jen's account of the whole situation.)&nbsp; Matt and Jen and their friends Russ and Cora (another couple -- Matt and Russ are best friends and were roommates for a really long time) and Jude (Matt's brother) got together one night and they were drinking (and probably doing drugs, too, knowing Jen) and they got really fucked up.&nbsp; Cora got a bug up her ass and wanted to flash Matt and Jude (yes, they were really fucked up).&nbsp; They were saying that she could on one condition: Jen must mess around with Russ (yes, they were really, really fucked up -- either that or they're just plain stupid -- then again, it might be the second one).&nbsp; A person of sound mind would think, "Gee, this must be the guys' way of deterring Cora from making a complete fool of herself ! "&nbsp; but my  retarded  sister takes it literally and goes on to mess around with Russ.&nbsp; Granted, Matt should have known better.&nbsp; He knows how stupid and unstable my sister is..&nbsp; I'm beginning to think that he might have done it on purpose to find reason to get mad at her and forbid her from seeing Logan -- but then, I can't convince myself that he is both that smart and that conniving.&nbsp; So anyway, Matt popped a gasket and there you have it.&nbsp; Jen is now talking to a lawyer about taking primary custody over her son..&nbsp; Which Brian and I both think is a bad idea, knowing her history and knowing how little she cares for him.&nbsp; What do you guys think?

      I attended my sister's lingerie party. My sister is practical. She just wants Soen brand cotton briefs from the Philippines. Instead I bought her leopard-print undies simply because she whispered that's what her fiance would want (for her to wear--not him! j/k) The party was fun. I have never seen so many pink striped boxes and bags before. By the looks of it, it seems like most of us got the idea of going to Victoria Secret's.     Anyway, I talked to Liz, her maid of honor. She said that she has three sisters and each of them chose a best friend or a close friend to be their maid of honor. She thinks it's really ought to be the future bride's choice. If you really have doubts about Jen, stick with getting a best friend or close friend you can count on. The maid of honor is like the assistant to the bride. She helps with a lot of the preparations--she plans the bridal shower and what-not. It's not unheard of to have both parents walk the bride down the aisle. I think I saw it done a few times while viewing others' wedding albums.    Jay, great write-up! I wish I was there for that service as well.    There was a great thunderstorm in the Bay Area last night. The flashes of lightning and the roar of thunder frightened my mother. She postponed our appointment with the seamstress. We had a blackout, and we stumbled around looking for flashlights and candles. We listened to my auntie's battery-operated radio. The lights came back on a hour or so later.    Well, that's it for now.     Be good to yourself and each other.    Peace, Glee

            content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">                             &nbsp;                       Hey Glee, sounds like a         nice service. We had one yesterday in Detroit (downtown's         about 55 miles from my house). Here's the writeup I did         for one of my church music lists:           It wasn't Yankee Stadium, and Pavarotti wasn't there, but it was a glorious worship experience nonetheless.  My soul was well-fed and nurtured.  About a thousand of us jammed into Fort Street Presbyterian Church in downtown Detroit at 4pm on Sunday to pray for peace, justice, and reconciliation.  Catholics, Jews, Baptists, Muslims, Lutherans, Sikhs, Methodists, Hindus, Presbyterians, Baha'i, Orthodox, and more, all praying for the healing of our nation.  Music was provided by the 100+ voice Spiritual Day Tricentennial choir (this year is the 300th anniversary of the founding of Detroit), a number of cantors (or other faiths' versions of cantors), and a very active assembly.  15 - 20 different folks led us in prayer, and provided reflections, including Cardinal Maida, who gave the statement of purpose.  The high points: ALL the music!  (list below) Baptist Rev. Edward Branch's reflection about where God calls us; Presbyterian Rev. Arlene Wallace Gordon's prayer, based on Ps. 24; Imam Abdul Hakim Jackson's reflection about Abraham, our common ancestor in faith (best snippet for the day - &quot;always act in faith and obedience, let God provide the results&quot;); Prayer litany led by 3 middle school kids - one Muslim girl, one Jewish boy, one Christian girl the common thread through ALL the prayers and reflections - the shared faith and purpose that unite us.  Here's what I know of the song list:  Prelude:  Spiritual Day Tricentennial Choir (I only caught the tail end, and did not recognize the songs, but participated where I could, when invited) Opening: America the Beautiful, assembly and choir Hymn: O God, Our Help (St. Anne, new verses by Carolyn Gillette - I'll put them below with copyright info), assembly and choir Musical Interlude:  Battle Hymn (cool arrangement for B-3 and drums), choir ..........................:  Total Praise (Smallwood), choir (those of us who know (and LOVE) this joined in) Chanted prayer by Jeremy Campion of the Muslim Unity Center Chanted prayer by (n?) from the Hindu temple Closing: T'filat Haderich (Traveler's Prayer), cantor Stephen Dubov of Temple Beth El and assembly - lyrics below   O God Our Help, extra verses: ----------------------------------------------- O God, our words cannot express the pain we feel this day; Enreged, uncertain, we confess our need to bow and pray.  We grieve for all who lost their lives and for each infured one; We pray for children, husbands, wives whose grief has just begun.  O Lord, we're called to offer prayer for all our leaders, too; May they, amid such great despair be wise in all they do.  We trust your mercy and your grace; In you we will not fear! May peace and justice now embrace!  Be with your people here!  copyright  2001, Carolyn Winfrey Gillette, 305 S. Broadway, Pitman NJ 08071.  All rights reserved.    T'filat Haderich (Traveler's Prayer) ----------------------------------------------- May we be blessed as we go on our way. May we be guided in peace. May we be blessed with health and joy.   May this be our blessing.  Amen.  May we be sheltered by the wings of peace. May we be kept in safety and love. May grace and compassion find their way to every soul. May this be our blessing.  Amen.  (no copyright info given)  Jay

      April, youre getting married?  I thought you just broke up with THAT guy?  As far as moms walking their daughter up the aisle, I feel that its no big deal.  My mom walked my sister up the aisle since my parents are divorced and my sister insisted that Mom do it not DAD.  As you might filter, my sister holds a lot of animosity towards my dad.  My brother in law even tried to settle the disagreements but my sister Marie just wont have it.  The market is up right now.  I hope it stays there.  For those of you that are watching the economy, pay close attention to those Oil Futures.  If they start rising significantly, be prepared for a war with IRAQ.  Ching, what a mess Jen has made.  Awaiting the further exploits...  ~Net

      Speaking of walking down the aisle, my mom, who is not to be out-done, wants to walk me down the aisle (or down to the garden -- because it's going to be an outdoor, garden wedding) too..&nbsp; So I guess she and my dad are  both  walking me to meet my husband-to-be.&nbsp; My sister, who I guess will be my maid of honor (still thinking about it, though), continues to dodge one catastrophe over another.&nbsp; First, she and Matt (the father of her baby) break up; then, she moves back in with mom and dad; a week later, she gets kicked out of the house; mom and dad do not want anything to do with her; she and Matt are friends again; mom and dad begin to tolerate her again (she actually weazeled some jewelry out of mom and my father's laptop -- even after all that went down -- can you say "spoiled" and "manipulative" ??? -- I don't care, though -- whatever will make her get her act back together -- I just feel sorry that her life is all fucked up -- then again, all our lives will be all fucked up anyway once the shit hits the fan -- but then, at least, that's not any of Jen's doing -- then again, maybe it is? -- she always has something to do with shit going wrong); everything seems to be going fine; yesterday afternoon she calls Brian and tells him that she and Matt had a major disagreement and now he refuses to let her see Logan.&nbsp; She is devastated of course!&nbsp; Wait till you hear  why  he's withholding visitation rights!&nbsp;  You'll find out on the next installment of.. "Jen's Fucked Up Life"

      Hello. Monday, SF had a Remembrance Day interfaith service. I watched it live. There were 12 to 14 different faiths represented. The most touching speech was given by a Muslim woman who wanted to give a "face" to who Muslims are. She said that she always considered herself a wife, a mother, a neighbor and that it was not until that "Tuesday" [Sept. 11] did she ever consider herself as the face of the enemy. She said the Koran does not condone violence or hatred. Another woman read from the Koran. A minister from the Metropolitan Church representing the LGBT community says that her community understood what it is like to be scapegoated and to be the recepients of hatred and violence. A Baptist minister got the most applause and a huge standing ovation when he said that the Koran mentioned removing "jehad" (sp?) from the self. He said the U.S. jehad is racism, sexism, homophobia, and xenophobia. He said our suffering would not be gone until we remove this from ourselves. At that service at the Civic Center, people of every stripe was there. I have never seen such a peaceful and moving service such as this. It filled me with awe and hope. I wished this was aired live throughout the nation. This is what I felt our country was about. I want to see more things like this. I'm tired of the images of the towers collapsing over and over again. I'm tired of hearing about the violent bigotry Americans are acting upon other Americans.    I cannot get to my on-line diary. This sucks. I posted the e-mail my friend sent me about her narrow escape from the WTC. I am so happy my friend and her co-workers got out alive. Her story was amazing. The way she helped her co-workers was so brave. She's too modest to call herself a hero.   My sister knew that I personally dislike making decisions. She already knows I also dislike formal occassions, and she knows that she would be asking a lot from me to be just a bridesmaid. Her maid of honor is a friend from church who has already gone through numerous wedding preparations before--besides, she really loves doing that kind of stuff.    I think this is your wedding, and I feel you have the right to decide who your maid of honor will be. Same goes for Brian: he has the right to decide who his best man will be. Heck, at a friend's wedding, the bride did not have a maid of honor--she had a best man (and she had a younger sister); and the groom did not have a best man--he had a best woman.

      April,    Its no better here in NY.  I was at my branch Saturday and this lady covered in her robe from head to toe.  She made a black and white copy and looking behind her back just in case anyone was looking. It looked like she was so afraid for her life.  She came up to the counter to pay for her copy and the article was about how muslims were hurt too about the World Trade Terrorism.  She thanked me for the copy and left the store so fast like someone was going to attack her.  I felt a sad that she would be so afraid just to make a copy.  In the news, an american drove into an indian owned store.  I was shocked at what people are doing out there.  Just because they are muslim doesnt mean that they are necessarily bad. May God protect these innocent people.    Net

       Hey April.  We have to stand by our Muslim friends!  They've got to be feeling scared and hurt about all the unjustified crap they're taking from ignorant (!!!) haters.  It makes as much sense to blame all American Catholics for Oklahoma City, since McVeigh was Catholic.  Blaming hundreds of millions of Moslems for the twisted actions of a small group is unfair.  And stupid.  I'm pleased to see our leaders (with whom I rarely agree) reiterating this - we don't have a gripe with Arabs.  We don't have a gripe with Moslems.  We have a gripe with terrorists.

      im glad ur friend is doing well, Cent. i had to deal with bigots and ignorants at work. we had a customer come up to our counter and slap my coworker just because she was wearing a hijab on her head. to make matters worse, she even spat at our department manager for hiring a "terrorist". yeah, it was a most stressful day at work today. plus, i went to her house and drop her off, rite. and we were watching the arabic network news on their tv. the newscasters were blaring propaganda that it was the jews that bombed the wtc. i mean, no one really knows for sure. its just very frustrating.

      Great news, Net!  We added Jennifer to our prayer book at church at yesterday's mass.  We had two managers from our company (Compuware) on one of the Boston planes - I didn't know them, but it still tugs at my heart.  Speaking of, I have to play a funeral for a two-month-old baby tomorrow.  SIDS.  She was only a week or two older than Alyssa.  I'm sure she's safe in the arms of the angels, but her poor family.  So I was so ready for some good news.  Thanks for letting us know, Net.   Daf.

      For those of you who dont have Flags.  Go to your Local Kinko's and ask for one its free.  Kinkos is giving away free flags on laser paper.  They will also print flags on vinyl material for 75% off.  I think it comes to about 25 bucks.  Just a little something the company I work for is doing for the community.  Want to have more fun?  Do a Flag Chain.  Print out 5 Flags on paper and give it to five people that you know.  Let those people do the same and spread nationalism!! USA, USA,USA.    ~Net

      Jennifer Chu is alright.  She survived the explosion.  Dot called her parents and they said that she was in shock but shes gonna be alright.  Im trying to avoid the city these last few days. Im staying with my mother in Queens.  Were all just trying to take it easy. Couple of days ago, the wind changed direction and the smoke from Downtown travelled to Queens. I left a window open that night and I woke up with a headache and a bad sinus. Almost like I had an allergy attack.  I took some coffee filters and used it as a mask tieing it to my face with rubber bands.  Thank goodness it rained,  the smoke conditions have faded.  Were all trying to get back to normal.  Monday, will be the beginning of it.  Oh and for those of you who are Jewish, Tuesday is Rosh Hassanah.  The coming week is also the UN Assembly.  Its gonna be a busy week for New Yorkers.  I wish you all a safe week.  ~Net (Cent)

      I feel sorry for those in the Washington DC and New York area..&nbsp; I feel sorry for the US..&nbsp; I feel sorry for the current president who has to make all these tough decisions..    We here in Kansas have been pretty much unaffected by it all.&nbsp; There were rumors that floated around about a price-hike in gas right after the incident.&nbsp; Of course, all of us gullible Wichitans lined up at all of the gas stations to fill up our tanks.&nbsp; Yes, I was one of them.&nbsp; Brian's dad actually took it further and went to Sam's Club to stock up on canned goods, etc.&nbsp; Roads surrounding McConnell AirForce Base have been blocked off, making it difficult for Brian and I to drive to-and-from our house and Derby (to take care of Pogi).&nbsp; The checkpoints have not helped Wichita traffic any.    At work we are collecting funds to donate to the Red Cross through our Eddie Bauer, Newport News and Spiegel phone customers.&nbsp; Many people are afraid that war will ensue..&nbsp; I'm worried, but optimistic that the situation will come to a peaceful resolution.&nbsp; I'm hoping, anyway.&nbsp; Let's pray that this is all over with by the time my parents have to return to the states.

      Greetings from NYC.  Im okay.  I woke up Tuesday and saw the second plane hit hit the other world trade tower!  It was the worse shock that I ever saw with my own eyes.  I tried to call my friend from Morgan Stanley and there was just busy signals.  I watched the rest of the activity on television and saw both skyscrapers fall and after that I was in disbelief that this would happen in the city where I lived.  I could not use my cell phone and the cable was disrupted for like 15 minutes there was no sound just pictures on the tv.  Hope you friends and relatives are alright.  My friend from Morgan Stanley, Jennifer Chu, is still missing.    ~net

      Glee, the reason I was curious was because I didn't know if it would be appropriate for me not select my sister as Maid of Honor.&nbsp; I really don't want my sister to be my Maid of Honor..&nbsp; I think it will be too much responsibility for her.&nbsp; But I feel that my mom and my sister are both expecting her to be my Maid of Honor.&nbsp; It sucks.&nbsp; Brian and I are both in the same predicament.&nbsp; He would rather not have his brother be his Best Man (because he really isn't), but we both want to follow the norm.&nbsp; I'm enlisting the help of my other Bridesmaids to make sure that everything goes according to plan.&nbsp; I wish my sister wasn't such a screw up.&nbsp;  Snatch  was a really good movie ! &nbsp; I hooked on  IncrediMail  !

      like all other book to movie "Count to Monte Cristo" will probably be butchered.  The director can only do so much.  Plus what we will be seeing is the directors ideas that were taken from the book. If you translate Brad in filipino i think it goes like Brad Pwet.. =)

      Rush Hour 2 was mad funny!  Dorothy gave me the translation while we were watching it.  Its good that they didnt put in dubs or translate it with text on the bottom of the screen.  It takes your vision away from the characters.  Better to have a translator next to you or view it on DVD when it comes out.

      Speaking of movies, Brian and I rented  Rush Hour  (I forgot that I had seen it a long time ago and I wanted to see it before watching  Rush Hour 2 , so we rented it).&nsbp; We watched it on Saturday night and went to watch  Rush Hour 2  in the theaters the following day.&nbsp; Brian had previously watched it with his dad, but he didn't mind watching it again.&nbsp; In part, because there were several Chinese people in the theater when they went the first time and they would start laughing before everyone else in the theater (they didn't have to wait for the translations).&nbsp; It annoyed the crap out of him ! &nbsp; It was a lot of fun.&nbsp; I love the out-takes at the end of the movie.&nbsp; Out-takes are always funny !     Tonight's DVD rentals are  Memento  and  Exit Wounds .&nbsp; Both movies came highly recommended.&nbsp;  Memento , by Glee and Louie (our favorite video store employee) and  Exit Wounds  by Brian's father David and our friend Richard.&nbsp; I didn't get a chance to watch  Memento  in the theaters as Glee had recommended a few months ago.&nbsp; I'm glad that it's now available to rent.  =)

      My friend Adrian and Rinna put action figures on their wedding cake.  They put Princess Lea  (Rinna) and Hans Solo (Adrian) as the bride and groom. My friends and I added the extra ones later on, Darth Vader as Adrian's Father-in-Law.  And Jabba the Hut as the Mother in Law... oooohhhh.  When the inlaws saw it.. they wondered who those caracters were suppose to be.   Well it was all in good fun.      Speaking of Steak, Last week was Restaurant Week in New York City.  Dot and I went to Smith and Woolensky with her cousin Kim and Kathy.  For 30 dollars you can order from the Prix Fixe Menu; appetizer-soup or salad; main course- Fillet Mignon; then dessert- Cheese Cake or Chocolate Mousse Cake.  Fillet Mignon is Medium Rare of course but for the 30 dollar price it was worth it!!!  Normally, a Steak dinner will cost around 60 dollars and up on average at Smith and Wollensky.  It will cost extra for the appetizer plus again for the dessert.  I think I spent about 200 dollars the last time I went at Smith's two years ago.   Glee, were you on a vegan or lacto-vegetarian diet?    Net    PS My brother Joe is running on the NYC Marathon this weekend. Volunteer water boys welcome...=)

      Hi, everyone! I'm back! I wanted to see if I could eat a vegetarian diet for 21 days. That quickly ended when I saw my father cooking up a steak yesterday. After a week of eating whole grains, pinto and/or black beans, baby green salads, hummus etc. I got so sick eating the steak. I should've started eating eggs, fish, poultry and then moved up the food chain.    I did not have the Reiki attunement. I already had my Reiki I attunement last year so it would be redundant to do it again. I was only taking this workshop as a refresher course--learn new hand positions and try to grasp what I could not understand the first time around. Reiki is "universal life energy." Many cultures talk about this energy: the Chinese call it "Qi" or "Chi, " the Japanese call it "Ki," and it has also been called "prana." Everyone has this energy, but it in order to be a clearer channel of this Reiki, one gets initiated by a Reiki Master (Teacher) through what's commonly called an "attunement." Reiki balances the energy in one's self and aids a person in his or her own healing process. A person who has an attunement can do self-treatments or do treatments for others.    I don't normally dress up for Halloween. My friend Amy said she was thinking of dressing as Anne Sexton (the confessional poet who committed suicide by gassing herself in the car garage). I said I would be willing to be Sylvia Plath if she would go through with it. (Sylvia Plath did herself in by sticking her head in a gas oven.) Amy has a habit of dressing in "obscure" historical figures. She's gonna end up dressing up as a Bolshevik or a French whore (I can't remember which historical period). Amy said I could dress as a pastry tray, but I said I'm too afraid of being attacked by birds.    Ching, I think Gladys (my sister) and her husband JP would be pleased to be starting a new trend in cake toppers. It sure beats paying 500 dollars for a candy version of yourself.    My mother is willing to get rid of the 70s orange flower-printed couch and matching loveseat. She is also willing to get rid of the oriental rug. Unfortunately, Salvation Army is not co-operating. They keep delaying their pick-up times. Grrrrr.  I swear the house I grew up in looked like a Filipino-version stage setting for the Brady Bunch.    Have a Happy Halloween!

      Sorry I've been out of commish for a while.&nbsp; Things have been somewhat hectic over here.&nbsp; I have not seen  Caligula .&nbsp; Brian, who is very opinionated when it comes to movies, has seen it -- but he has no desire to see it again.&nbsp; I guess I am out of luck.    I saw  A Clockwork Orange  a while back.&nbsp; I think I wrote a paper on several years ago.&nbsp; I own it on video and and I have the book which has the crucial final chapter that was conveniently omitted from the movie version.&nbsp; It's one of my all-time favorites.    Speaking of movies,  Final Fantasy  is now available on DVD.&nbsp; Brian and I bought it today at Sam's Club.&nbsp; We had to call his parents to bail us out because we needed to buy food for our barbecue this afternoon and both our Sam's Club cards were expired.&nbsp; And Sam's was the only place we could get 40 hamburger patties for less than 10 bucks !     The action figure cake toppers gave Brian and I a wonderful idea.&nbsp; We're going to be copy cats and use action figures as our cake toppers, too ! &nbsp; Brian loved the idea because he is an avid action figure collector.&nbsp; When I first read your message, Glee, I got very excited..&nbsp; "I know exactly which action figure I want to represent me ! " I told Brian.&nbsp; He thought I was going to pick Xiaoyu from the video game Tekken (because I kick ass at the game when I play her -- I am totally invincible, except when Brian selects Eddie Gordo, his strongest character, to play against me).&nbsp; He was completely surprised when I told him that I choose Elektra (from Marvel Comics).&nbsp; "Then I'll be Logan," he says.&nbsp; "Wolverine?&nbsp; Why?" I asked.&nbsp; Brian explains that Elektra and Logan had some sort of relationship 8 years ago.&nbsp; Of course, only a handful of people will know the significance of the characters we selected.&nbsp; I'm so excited already.&nbsp; My mom will literally flip out !

      21 days!!!  thats too long.  Holloween is coming try to look then.  Any interesting ideas for costumes anyone? Beuler?  Beuler?    I wonder what Kubrick would have said, if he was still alive, about his 2001 movie.  Where's HAL?   Will HAL appear in the XP release of Microsoft?  or does Steve Jobs have something up his sleeve? "Open the bomb bay doors HAL".  Say hello to Bin Laden!!     okay back to reality.    Net

       Hi Glee,  I don't like the gory stuff either.  Didn't mind  Clockwork Orange , though, mostly intelligent, a lot of the violence was implied rather than on-camera.  Next to  2001 , it may be Kubrick's best work.  What's a Reiki attunement?  Or should I go look it up 'cos you'll be gone for 21 days?     Daf

      Reply to APRiL: Were you referring to my friend Amy or the weddding?   I think  Caligula  would mess up my sensitive disposition, so I'll pass on that one. The sex wouldn't bother me, the gore would. Because  Clockwork Orange  is one of those movies that is contstantly being alluded in media and in conversation, I thought maybe I would watch it to see what the commotion was about. Is it the kind of movie that would give me nightmares?   I saw the latest David Lynch film  Mulholland Drive . If you like David Lynch's work, then you would probably like it. I don't really care for Lynch's movies. Then again, I don't enjoy being disturbed for entertaintment. My own life disturbs me enough.   Well, I'm going to disappear again. I'm finally getting my business license. So, I'm off to build my own business as an independent contractor. Also, I'm going to go through a Reiki attunement so I will be resting for about 21 days starting Sunday.

       There were a bunch of versions of  Caligula .  I'm pretty sure the "R" version skipped the orgy scene.  IMDB has a bunch of info on it.  Also, the DVD had a "making of..." segment that included interviews with Guccione, McDowell, the director, Gore Vidal (the author), and some of the extras.  The orgy scene was directed and produced by the Gooch himself, and did not involve any of the stars.  A lot of Penthouse Pets, enough guys to keep it interesting, and at least one "little person".  As for the violence,  Clockwork Orange  seemed more beatings than killings.  Not so with  Caligula , which had that decapitation machine (sort of a street sweeper with blades), several bloody murders - one including castration, and a "fantasy" scene early on where McDowell imagines all kinds of naked people dying horrible deaths - an early glimpse into his psyche.  I'd like to see  Spiderman , but  Monsters  is the one we're waiting for.  And  Lord of the Rings .  And  Harry Potter .  Can you say "arrested development"?    Daf

      When is Spiderman going to be shown in theatres? Havent Blogged in weeks... Got sick, dont worry its not Anthrax, just the usual sore throat due to the change in weather. Caligula can be compared to Clockwork Orange as far as violence is concerned.  That orgy scene was just plain porn.  How did that ever get an R rating I dont understand. "Has anybody seen my stapler?"

      Reply to Ching's post: No, she doesn't pop microwaveable popcorn. She has to get fresh popcorn kernels from the Solono County's crops. My friend Amy has an opinion about everything. She doesn't settle for less, if she doesn't have to, when she knows "the best" is readily available. Weird, huh?     My sister's wedding and reception were both a fabulous success. The food was wonderful, the reception location was romantic with a huge window view of the city and the bay at night, and the entertainment was spectacular: the groom serenaded the bride singing a punk rock cover of the punk rock band's  cover of the 80s song "Glory of Love." We, both bridesmaids and groomsmen, were all surprised he had it in him. Turns out it was his dream to sing in a rock band. The wedding cake was a simple round two-tier angel food with strawberries in the middle. It was decorated with red rose petals and the bride/groom topper was two anime acting-figure characters. I said an impromptu speech about the bride and groom in front of 300 guests. We had guests fly in from Canada, L.A., and the East Coast.   The newlyweds honeymooned in a bed-n-breakfast in the Napa Valley.   They opened their wedding presents yesterday. For some reason the couple has more knife sets than would be considered practical. They also have two disco balls--yes, that was on their wedding registry. Still, it's one too many. I noticed their bathroom and kitchen stuff were either black or silver or grey. I have a strange feeling my brother-in-law has taken charge of the interior decorating. *sigh* Well, my sister and her husband are living in the house my sister and I grew up in as children. (My mother, father, aunt, and I live in the carehome, the place of my mom and aunt's work.)

      More movies:   Cider House Rules  - excellent character development, real tear-jerky, Charlize Theron is hot hot hot (!!!), and the male lead (forgot his name?) reminds me a whole bunch of a friend of mine.  Pro-abortion stance might be disturbing to some, as well as an incest subplot, but very well done.  Best role Michael Caine's had in years!   Caligula  - always wondered what was up with this one - what happens when a star-studded cast (Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, Sir John Gielgud) works a movie produced by Bob Guccione?  Boy, did we ever find out!  I knew it'd be graphic, but the violence was downright evil!  And though I expected sex, I didn't expect stroker porn - but there it was - big 15 minute (?) orgy scene near the end, played like any other porn movie, except slightly better photography, and the sound of Malcolm McDowell hollering in the background instead of a fuzak soundtrack.  Kim hated it, I thought O'Toole and McDowell were very good, though McDowell was uneven.  And I did rewatch the orgy once more, but felt appropriately dirty and ashamed afterwards.   The Players Club  - Tawdry drama set in a black strip club.  Far enough outside my cultural experience that I question my judgment on it, but didn't really ring true.  Female lead was pretty good, and Jamie Foxx was likeable, but the criminal element was really two-dimensional.  Daf

      I loved reading the book  Grendel . My friend Albert recommended it to me. I heard the author was a resident of Chico (I attended CSU, Chico), and he died in a motorcycle accident. I loved the part in the book when this ram had this tenacity to climb this mountain and Grendel would try to knock it down. The ram reminds me of my more determined friends. Grendel, the character himself, reminds me of my friend Albert.     My friend Amy rented  Holy Smoke  on VHS. (She still has no desire to buy a DVD player.) Strange flick. Harvey Keitel in drag is just a weird image. Keitel plays P.J. an exit counselor who tries to deprogram Kate Winslet who believes she found love and enlightenment from Bubba, an East Indian guru. Amy made the best buttered popcorn--this side of Solano County.    I'm gonna take a leave of absence in the blogging for a while. This is the last week to get ready for my sis' big day, and I have to supplement my income to pay off my student loan and the mound of bills. Grrrrrr.

      Hey April!  Like the Mike Reiss.  Wonder what he thought of  Grendel .  One of my faves.  Also like Tom Hanks.  I'm so middle-class!  Speaking of (Middle class) - DVD players are under $100 now, so we bought one, and a few rewatchables we didn't already have:  Caddyshack, Music Man, North by Northwest, Round Midnight, My Fair Lady, Raging Bull .  Rented a couple DVDs too - LOVED(!!!)  O Brother Where Art Thou?   Great  Ulysses  references - sirens, Cyclops, the wife who's going to remarry.  I always liked the Coen Bros., but this was even better than I hoped.  Helps I'm a bluegrass fan too.  And  The Mexican .  Pretty cool plot twists, and some pretty dark humor.  More blood than I like (I like NONE,  Raging Bull  notwithstanding).  Julia Roberts was a little over-the-top with her psychobabble, but I'm sure there are girls out there just like her.  Daf

      When you are old and gray and full of sleep,  And nodding by the fire, takedown this book,  And slowly read, and dream of the soft look  Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;    How many loved your moments of glad grace,  And love your beauty with love false or true;  But one man love the pilgrim soul in you,  And loved the sorrows of your changing face.    And bending down beside the glowing bars  Murmur, a little sad, From us fled Love;  He paced upon the mountains far above,  And his his face amid a crowd of stars.    W B Yeats

      Has anyone seen  Monsters, Inc.  or  Harry Potter ? I was wondering if either one was worth watching.    I agree w/ you, Ching. "Todo" sounds too much like "Toto," and "Burrows" sounds like--well, burrows. A digging dog? Start over: Use his nickname or middle name. I don't like my name--it sounds too vain: "Belladonna Proudfoot."    Ching, do you have a wedding date set?    Being a lapsed Catholic, I can appreciate the aforementioned joke. :)

      My brother finished the marathon Sunday at around 5 pm.  We had trouble looking for the family reunion area.  Last year, the family reunion was inside the park.  Due to higher security it was moved to Central Park West.  We got in the park on the East Side and hiked for 2 miles finally finding a route which made us go on a Northern path.  We ended up on 86th street where we heard on a loud speaker that we are suppose to meet my brother at the reunion area on 74th Street!  Dot and I sprinted down Central Park West towards 74th Street.  We spotted a water stand and grabbed a couple of water bottles.  People were cheering us down Park West and at the corner of 74th there were bright lights and my brother in a foil blanket waiting for me and Dot.  Crowds were cheering and we were so happy that we got reunited with my brother Joe. By the way I hope you dont mind the exaggeration in the last 2 sentences.

      Yes!  We do have one in Wichita.  I ordered my gown already.  It was so easy!  I can't believe other people take forever to decide!  I'm just mroe decisive than most I guess.  After trying on 12 gowns and 2 1/2 hours at the store, I ended up choosing the very first one that I tried on.  We took pictures of all the dresses that I tried on.  I forgot my camera, so it's in Brian's dad's digital camera.  He's supposed to give me a disk with the pictures.  I will show them to you.  We have to be really discreet because it's bad luck for Brian to my dress.  It'll be a surprise!  I still have to wait four months for my dress to arrive (it's one that has to be ordered), but I am so excited already!

      i guess if you dont have email service, one can go the route of april and have someone add tones to your phone.  Otherwise, wait a bit and soon all of the cellphone providers will welcome email as part of their service.    Net

      Q: What do you call a midget psychic who just commited a crime? A: A small medium at large.      My apologies for the "corny" joke.. It's funnier if you speak tagalog, though.&nbsp; I don't have email service on my phone (it's a Nokia 8290, but Brian and I don't have email).  =(  Any other suggestions?

       Rock Star  stars Mark Wahlberg (previously Marky Mark, brother of Donnie(sp?) of NKOTB and leader of the Funky Bunch back in the 80's) and Jennifer Aniston (Rachel of Friends).&nbsp; He's this loser who is obsessed with this rock band (Steel Dragon).&nbsp; He sings the songs, wears the clothes and is the lead singer of a Steel Dragon cover band (he insists it's a "tribute" band).&nbsp; When the lead singer of Steel Dragon leaves the band, Marky Mark is drafted to replace him and the story goes on.. etc. etc. etc.&nbsp; Think Van Halen.&nbsp; All throughout the movie I kept thinking of the similarities: it's like the Van Halen story or something.&nbsp; Anyway, it's really good.&nbsp; I didn't think it would be, but I liked it.&nbsp; It even made me cry.

      I haven't seen  Rock Star . I'm not even sure if I ever saw a trailer for it. What's the premise? Maybe I can remember if you reminded me.    Thanks for the invite Ching, but my 'puter is too slow. You'd be waiting for next move forever. It would not be worth your time.    I have a question for everyone. How did each of you run across Chingay? Were you just surfing the net? And since we seem to be the survivors of the Chingay Yahoo! Club what made you persist?

      My bestfriend is really Sheryll.&nbsp; She lives in the Philippines.&nbsp; You can find out more about her on the  SMEAGHE Today  page also.&nbsp; Pia is a really, really, really good friend of mine.&nbsp; I'm able to stay in touch with her better than I can with Sheryll because she lives in California.&nbsp; Pia and I have known each other since grade school -- so we've known each other for over fifteen years, by my estimation.&nbsp; I met Sheryll during my first year in high school (American translation: seventh grade) and we've been the best of friends ever since.    I'm glad that you like the look of the page Glee.&nbsp; I'd been tinkering around with it for the past few weeks and I think I've found a layout that I'm happy with.&nbsp; Hey, you're a word freak, aren't you?&nbsp; You should go to  games.com  and play me Scrabble.&nbsp; It's tons of fun !     Has anybody seen  Rock Star  yet?&nbsp; It's actually pretty good.&nbsp; I was surprised.

      Net, wish those were real smackaroos, could use them right about now. Gleetv222 was online that night. You just missed her by a coupla hours. What's your AIM?    Why don't they create sculptures in the likeness of those who were involved? I don't care if they were all White. Cities should hire more latino, black, and other people of color as firefighters. When these people of color get involved in another historical event, then they rightfully deserve their own commemorative sculptures.     Pia is Ching's best friend if I remember correctly.

      Glee, is that your final answer? You are correct again Glee for 25,000 web clogger dollars.  Im in NY.  Who is Pia? Ive never seen her post anything.  Gleetv222 must be online during the day. I dont see her tonight. =)     Heres a thought to ponder, Some people here in NY want to erect a memorial for 911.  It would comprise of those firefighters raising the US flag on Ground Zero only instead of their actual skin color one will be Black, another will be Latino, and the third White.  In actuality there were no other firefighter in that situation that was black or latino.  Why is it that when one wants to erect a sculpture of art, some people want to add hints of color?  The sculpture by-the-way is going to be in bronze. Net

      Ching, the web page looks great! Even one of those little characters on the top right hand corner kinda look like me. Well, you wouldn't know. I never sent you my photo. You're gonna hate me for telling you this, but I did send two of my photos to another internet chum, and I even sent a videotape of myself to another internet chum. Yeah, yeah, I know. I've known you longer than those two, and you deserve seniority priveleges. But I sent you my favorite books and xeroxed pages from my diary, that should count for something, dammit! Oh, I'm tendrilling (a word I stole from Susan Swan's novel,  The Wives of Bath , it means rambling). I like the book list segment. You trust my judgment that much to give it its own section? ;)     BTW, Ching, read the latest two entries of my last adventure in the City at OD.    Vince, I'm sorry for the belated response to your offline Yahoo Messenger message. I hardly use YM. I tend to use AIM as Gleetv222. You can put me on your Buddy List for both YM and AIM.     April, I didn't know you are in TX. Jay, remind me where you are located. Vince, you're in the East Coast, right? Was it NY? Pia is in CA last that I remember.

      I loved  A Beautiful Mind .&nbsp; It made me cry.&nbsp; It reminded me a little of  Bicentennial Man ..&nbsp; Probably because the recognition did not come until several years later.&nbsp; I hope you don't mind my sharing this.&nbsp; I thought that since it's based on a true story, most of you would know about it and how it ends.&nbsp; Kind of like if I told you that they all died at the end of  The Perfect Storm , it wouldn't really be a  spoiler  because that's a given.&nbsp; I have not seen  Shine  (and I know I should; Brian has and says it's very good) so I cannot make a comparison.&nbsp; I guess the similarity to  Good Will Hunting  is that they are both math geniuses and the college campus setting..&nbsp; But that's about all that they have in common.&nbsp; The story that ABM tells is way different.&nbsp; You'll have to see it.&nbsp; It's really good.    We went to see  Black Hawk Down  this afternoon.&nbsp; It's really good.&nbsp; I liked the movie.    By the way, Glee, next time you post something click on the " view web page " link on the left.&nbsp; You have your own special section on  urlLink our blog .&nbsp; Check it out!

      I love sinigang and adobo also. :) (For Christmas, my friend Amy bought me a book called  Sarap . It was a collection of essays about the history and customs of Filipino food.)    Wowzah! You look beautiful in those gowns, Ching! I wish I could attend cuz I have known you for years. I feel like I know you even though we haven't met in person. But, alas, I have to save what little scratch I have for when I move. :(    I want to see Beautiful Mind. I heard it's a cross between Shine and Good Will Hunting. What do you think?    I promised you a reading list. I don't know if you're in the mood to read novels, but that's what I've been reading lately so these are what come to mind:   Some Girls  by Kristin McCloy   Like Being Killed  by Ellen Miller   The Price of Salt  by Patricia Highsmith, writing as Claire Morgan   Indigo  by Graham Joyce   Po Man's Child  by Marci Blackman

      It's okay if he sees them because I didn't pick any of those dresses..&nbsp; I might post pictures of the dress that I actually picked, but I'm still trying to decide if I really want to post them or not.&nbsp; I'd like to invite you guys to the wedding, but I can't guarantee accommodations.&nbsp; My mom has a small house, we have a small house and we don't have any money.&nbsp; Besides, I don't want to obligate any of my online friends to come.&nbsp; I don't want to be too pressumptuous.&nbsp; For one, I don't want to assume that any of you will actually take time out from your work/life to attend a wedding of someone you hardly know and have never-ever met in person.&nbsp; Secondly, Kansas is pretty boring.&nbsp; Other than the wedding and reception, there's really not much to do here.&nbsp; I'd be totally thrilled if you all came, but don't blame me (for the rest of your life) if you get bored and don't have any fun.&nbsp; I'm telling you now, if you're planning on any kind of partying during your stay, the night life is non-existent.    All that aside, if any of you are interested in attending though, just email me your address and I promise to send out an invitation and rsvp card.

I took the day off today to clean the house.&nbsp; We are having company over.&nbsp; It's feeding time at Brian and Ching's.&nbsp; You all know how much we've come to love entertaining.&nbsp; We are a couple of suzie-homemakers.&nbsp; Richard and I are making chicken & pork adobo.&nbsp; And I am making pork sinigang with leafy stuff (I don't know what it is called, I normally don't eat vegetables) & bamboo shoots.&nbsp; I even borrowed my mom's big rice cooker so we'd have enough rice for everyone!&nbsp; We'll take some pictures..&nbsp; After all, this is our first official get-together for 2002.&nbsp; I'll have to post it in my personal blog.

      I just finished watching DRIVEN.  Man I never seen racing that razor sharp.. the graphics was fabulous.  My heart was racing till the end! I didnt watch it in the movies due to mixed reviews but this was awesome.  Brian would want to watch this film.  Oh and if you will watch this in surround sound it will sound like WHOA!!!  =)  Ching, are you going to wear a crown or a tiara? My sister wore one on her wedding.  I thought it was a finishing touch to a perfect day.    This is my second NEW Year's that I have not made the ER's top ten alcohol poisoning story.  I made it through my brother-in-law's party without drinking a single alcoholic drink inspite of the taunting and temptation.  I did get into the Merengue and Cha-cha sessions.      My coworkers have told me that security in TIMES SQUARE was strict and extreme.  You could not even get a back pack in the area.  Im glad the party when on without a hitch.    HERE's to a wonderful NEW YEAR ~

      Brian and I saw  Lord of the Rings  together, but he went to see  Harry Potter  all by himself yesterday.&nbsp; He got the day off and I had to work ! &nbsp; =P&nbsp; Brian and I both want to see  Hedwig and the Angry Inch ..&nbsp; Thanks for the heads-up.&nbsp; I'll try to rent it here.&nbsp; I hope they didn't ban it or anything.&nbsp; I hate the bible-belt !     All reading recommendations are welcome.&nbsp; I'm working on my sister's copy of  The Unmade Bed  right now.&nbsp; It's an anthology of erotic stories.&nbsp; So far, the stories have been pretty good.&nbsp; I sometimes read to Brian when the mood strikes.    Brian and I bought  The Fast and the Furious .&nbsp; He loves that movie ! &nbsp; The effects were great ! &nbsp; And I  love  Jordana Brewster ! &nbsp; She's so hot !   Wedding plans are slowly creeping along.&nbsp; We anticipate to finalize the guest list and order the invitations next week.&nbsp; My second fitting for my wedding gown is on the 27th -- and I am very excited.&nbsp; The gown fits like a glove ! &nbsp; As though it was made for me.&nbsp; My mom was teasing me about it.&nbsp; She said I can't gain weight between now and the wedding because if I do, my dress won't fit ! &nbsp; It really fits so perfect ! &nbsp; The only aspect that needed altering was the length -- as can be expected.    P.S. My holiday and gift stories are posted in my online journal ( urlLink http://ching.i85.net )..&nbsp; There's lots of pictures, too ! &nbsp; Don't forget to check the archives !

Ching, I don't know if I already told you, but  Hedwig and the Angry Inch  is out on video. I saw it in the new release section at Hollywood Video. With all the activity that's going on, I'm not sure if you have any leisure time to do any reading. But I do have a few recommendations if you're interested. How far are you coming along w/ the wedding plans?   How was everyone's holidays? Any good stories or presents to mention?

      Yes, I met Jessica Hagedorn at the comPAss'  On the Verge: Conversations on Pilipino American Studies conference at UC Berkeley. She autographed my DOGEATERS. I just talked to the main organizer of comPASs ( Committee for Pilipino American Studies). He gave me her agent's information so I could contact her. She has a new book out. It's a compiliation of her two poetry books, and it's published by City Lights (yes, of the Beat generation fame). I'll buy a book, and get it autographed for you, okay, Ching?

      Wow its been a couple of weeks since my last blog.  One of my sacrifices for let is to lessen my online activities. Its official, my job has shafted me for the second time this year.  First they told us that we will only get 1 performance appraisal this year (means one raise).  Now they might not even give me a raise since the head of HR says our region is now a Level 2 which means we are regarded as a low level producer.- levels of pay is lower. Time to call in the UNION.  No democracy occurring at work.  I am reminded of the time Sally Field stands up on a table and puts up a sign...    ~Net

      Well, now, I'm looking for a spokenword poets/artists/performers for a Vallejo spokenword group I named Phoenix Rising Spokenword Corps. I named it Phoenix Rising cuz that's what trying to survive and thrive in Vallejo is like--coming from the ashes. The soul of Vallejo is dying. Back in it's hey day it was a bustling Navy town. Now, it's dead with a dying economy. People go to neighboring and surrounding cities for entertainment, shopping, art, etc. What I'm trying to do is shake things up. People say there's nothing to do here. I say, "As long as there is 'nothing to do' there IS something to do cuz you have to build 'something' out of 'nothing.'" I have a big heart. People could understand if I want to do this for fame or money or self-promotion. But really it's cuz I have a message, and I need to get it out.   Well, coming up soon Celebration of Poetry and Arts: kick off benefit for DEAR OPRAH Book Campaign Tour, featuring Jessica Hagedorn, the national slam champ Big Poppa E., co-founder of touring spokenword women group Sister Spit--Michelle Tea, and of course, Phoenix Rising. That's my dream...to bring all the arts and poets of Vallejo to commune, converse, etc. with their neighbors--from different cities, states,--heck, let's make it global.

       Glee, you've had a lot of challenges!  I'm pleased you've stuck to it - the prize goes to the persistent.  I made a lot of my progress by not having any idea how bad I sucked.  Later on, after jumping through some more hoops, I could say "wow, I was lucky I made iot through without getting discouraged", because I discourage easily.  I get lots of positive feedback, very little negative - I think it speaks more to the politeness of my colleagues than my outstanding talent.  I actually find my compositions and performances pretty mundane, BUT a lot of what passes for good songwriting and arranging is even worse.  And knowing that the big boys find my tossed-off work worthy of publishing makes me hopeful that they'll like the stuff we actually use in my church even better.  I was supposed to meet with a publisher's rep last month, and haven't had time (60-75 hour weeks on the day gig).  I'm going to try to set something up soon.  Meantime, Glee, you keep it up.  I'll be watching for you on Oprah.  Daf

      I have been writing poetry and short stories since elementary school. My teacher would assign us to do one limerick and I would create over 20. Another teacher would assign a short story and I would write two. I wrote letters to my sister. In high school, I didn't pass notes--I passed 10-page letters to classmates. I kept a journal since I was 15. I have over 85 journals with an average of 200 pages each.    I wrote for the West Wind newspaper in junior high and then the school paper advisor convinced me to be an editor for the literary mag The Zephyr. I later wrote for the Vallejo Sr. High paper and wrote an editorial that won me accolades from the school principal, and literally saved my high school newspaper's editor's ass by clearing up the mess that a local city paper reporter created by making a non-event into a huge one.    I read in several cafes in Chico. My poetry has been part of a Muticultural Humanities and Fine Arts  Club's art exhibit. I read my work on the college radio station and on the community radio station. I won a first cash prize for best essay with my poem "Anxiety Closet." I have been editor of the English Department's Watershed literary magazine. Later, I was published in two issues of Watershed. I have been in various Chico zines including Thrust Magazine edited by R. Eirik Ott, The Mask edited by Cristina Croooks, and CSUC's Women's Center's lit mag Her Own Voice. R. Eirik Ott brought a new type of poetry to the scene. He hosted Word Core open mics. I brought down the house with my poem "My American Tongue, My Ilokano Tastebuds" at one of his readings.     When I went back home to Vallejo, CA, I complained to a friend that I missed having a "community." I meant like-minded people who were into the arts. My friend Jacqui who was a Filipino community activist thought I meant "Filipino American community." Next thing I know I was reading to over 50 people mainly pillars of the Vallejo Filipino community--they were politicians,  business people, reverends, etc. The theme was "Silent Truth." That was the title of the event. Being true to my artistic vision I stuck to the theme and read poems with taboo subject matter, especially to the Filipino community. I didn't get booed. Worse, no one said anything about my work. A few days later, I was walking along the Vallejo marina when a member of that audience, a man I remember being introduced as the senior board member of the Filipino American Social Services, looked at me like I was dirt.    I was dating a punk pinoy poet named Rupert at the time. Together we organized another poetry event. It took forever just to get a flyer approved with the Vallejo Unified School District. My friend and artist Ryan Omega created a wonderful drawing, but for some reason, they disapproved the picture. I ended up not using the drawing and created another flyer with just text. The poetry reading met with a modicum success. I did not get the the young people interested. I ended up with older people trying so hard to be hip. I was hoping that I would get submissions for my zine Pocketful of Misfits, but I didn't get enough quality submissions that met with my editorial ideas. I wanted a zine that would be a voice for the displaced youth--the type that had something to say, but would not go to a newspaper or lit mag normally. I wanted to create something revolutionary--something radical. Something anti-establishment. I ended up with abstract death/suicide poems. And yeah, the older folks trying to sound hip or funny. Yeah, I saw some gems, and I thought well, "maybe." Then I lost the nerve. And when I mustered the nerve again, I lost the money.    I began reading at Booklover's Haven in Vallejo, CA. It was the only sanctuary for poets that wree not part of the arts cliques or circles that seem to deter new blood or anything away from the norm. It was quiet and supportive place. Then I read In Company Wolves Cafe in Benicia, CA. This place was filled with gay punk kids who pretended not to have money. My gay male friend Bobby swore up and down that he heard me yelling obscenities at the top of my lungs into the mic. I don't remember doing such a thing. Then again, I have selective memory.     I read at an Asian American/Pacific Islander open mic in Oakland, CA. No one signed up to read for the open mic. I was a newbie from a different city. I was scared. The hostess said to read as long as I want. I felt so strange. I read almost everything from my stack of papers. When the featured poet finally showed up, I felt like I read more work than he did. It was truly mortifying experience. I did not want him to think I was invading on his turf. He was a queer pinoy poet/performer/writer, and I didn't want to diss him. But somehow I felt like I did him wrong.    Benicia's Roasting Company, Boadecia's Bookstore's Open Dyke Myke, Justice League's pin@y spokenword, etc. Alas, I finally read at my first poetry slam at the Erotic Poetry Slam in Berkeley. I read first as the sacrificial poet. I must've scored the lowest. I knew the women would show cleavage for days. I did the opposite. I wore exactly what a male poet would wear--the same shit he normally wears on any average day: t-shirt and jeans. I spent my entire life dealing with this friggen idea of being compared and contrasted to the talents and beauty of other girls as a pinay. There I was at a poetry slam, and I felt the same thing--this friggen beauty contest mentality. I thought I had the far sexiest poem, the far most challenging to perform piece. Yet, I scored very low. The audience disappointed me--they were far too predictable. I read them too well.     On Feb. 21 this year on my 32nd birthday, I read at Listen & Be Heard for the second time--the first time at Rafael's bar though. They changed location from the Fetterly Playhouse. The audience showed their love. It was warm and supportive. The men's work surprised me with their depth and compassion. Even when they flowed with their freestyle, they had a message beyond saying ho's and bitches and gangbanging. It was about love and observations of life. And I loved them for it--kuyas, salamat. Martha Cinader was impressed with my reading she said that we needed to give me a "title." She and Lecrecia were already hosting the show--there were already enough hosts. She was thinking about it. So, now you're looking at the new house poet for Listen & Be Heard at Vallejo. Rap stars put Vallejo on the map. Jaime Kennedy thought he put slam poets on the map side by side with Vallejo. Nah, I'm going for the big time. Yeah, Oprah...    I wish I could wish something for my mom on Oprah. But there would be nothing Oprah can do for my mom. My mother needs her soul to be cleansed. That's on my mom--no one else can do that for her. My mother is very devout and religious born-again Christian, but she's not in touch with her soul. My Piscean nature could sense this from her. It's like in spite of all her praying, she's still very broken and barely hanging on a thread. It's sorta like having a person go through mediation practice--they are soo focused on how they breathe that they forget the whole point of the meditation and that's to just BE.    You have enough, you are enough...just be...

      Daf, I'll ask my mom about your song. She's part of a Filipino church choir.   Ching, I will get a P.O. Box some time next week. I rather use my other YAHOO! ID (dearoprah). I'm having problems with gleetv e-mail address. I will have to get back to you about blog templates, design, etc. I'm trying to get Listen&BeHeard to sponsor this tour. I think I first will have to promote Grito Serpentino, a neochicano spokenword and music ensemble, that will be playing next Thursday at Listen&BeHeard. When that's taken care of, I think she will be more willing to hear what I have to say. I swear I'm going to put Vallejo, CA on the map for poetry and the arts. :)

      GLEE:&nbsp; Since you already have a YAHOO!

Here are some templates that you could choose from:  urlLink blogger templates .&nbsp; Let me know which one you'd like to use and I will get it set up for you.&nbsp; If you have specific design ideas, just let me know and we will create your own custom blog template together.

      Hey, Ching and everyone!  I was thinking of updating my Amazon wishlist, but I'm just soo busy. So, here's a list of birthday wishes: relaxing CDs for massage, Ani DiFranco's Little Castle (? or was it Little Pink Castle?) CD, The Complete Works of Audre Lourde (sp?), blank journals, books on Reflexology or Reiki or hilot, pens, stationery, twin-sized cotton flannel sheet sets, aromatherapy candles, organic essential oils, organic cooking spices, vegetarian cookbooks with quick and easy recipes for the single busy person, books on copywrite laws, books on grantwriting...Well, you get the idea. Heck, if you are on the creative bent. Just send me a friendly letter in a decorated (mailart) envelope.    Ching, can you give me some tips, pointers about starting my own personal blog?   I'm going to read at Listen & Be Heard: open mic and jam session tomorrow on my birthday night. My parents are going to treat me for a birthday dinner and then I will have to go it alone at the mic. I practically had to lie by saying I had a business appointment (when I really was going to an open mic poetry event). How long do you think I could keep up hiding the fact that I'm going on tour, creating a book, and aspiring to get on Oprah? My mother is very concerned. She keeps telling me: "Be careful what you write." I think it's her own fears and her own hiya that's acting up.

        1. What was the first thing you ever cooked?     Spice cake, penuche icing.  From the Betty Crocker Cookbook for Children (1959?)    2. What's your signature dish?   Hot Dogs.  Boiled.  Kowalski natural casing.  Red Pelican brown mustard.    3. Ever had a cooking disaster? (tasted like crap, didn't work, etc.) Describe .  Two serious ones.  One, munchie-induced, where I decided that meatloaf mixed with peanut butter (cooked together) would be real good.  Took one bite, tossed the whole pan.  The other, Christmas dinner, rolled roast and Yorkshire pudding.  My (late) sister was tarnexing silver, and the container slipped - Tarnex all over the Yorkshire pudding.  Waah!!!    4. If skill and money were no object, what would make for your dream meal?   Having my sister back.  The food is secondary, but it'd be cool to relive that one without the Tarnex.  Plus artichokes with drawn butter anf homemade mayo, pickled watermelon, Mom's "book club rice" (with Beau Monde seasoning, Ching!), Kim's Watergate salad, and Dad's spaghetti - a three-day cooking process, the technique buried with him when he died last year.  He put the recipe in a church cookbook once, but left out some details - so his was always special.  No red hot dogs, though.    5. What are you doing this weekend?  Well we're past the weekend now, but I knew what it would be anyhow - work.  70ish hour weeks through March.      Daf

      I have a wishlist on Amazon. It's my birthday next week Feb 21. I'll be 32, but no one believes it. They think I transposed the numbers of my age--23. Well, that's a first. At least, I look I'm of legal drinking age.   I did the Erotic Poetry Slam thing at Berkeley, CA, Feb. 13. Anyway, I think I scored low because I was doing blatant self-promotion. I'm trying to raise funds for my new self-published book DEAR OPRAH. I'm going to do a DEAR OPRAH Book Campaign Tour. Its mission is two-fold: 1)Get me published--alas! and 2)Raise money so I can fly to Chicago and meet Oprah. Any volunteers? I need donations, promotional materials, webdominatrixes--uh, I mean, webmasters/mistresses. Would anyone be interested?

      I came across something that may be of interest to you, Glee..  Small Spiral Notebook .&nbsp; The submission guidelines are  as follows .&nbsp; You may be interested in this also, Daf.&nbsp; By the way, do any of you guys have wishlists at Amazon?&nbsp; I was just wondering.&nbsp; Because I was thinking of linking to everyone's wishlists.&nbsp; You can tell a lot about a person by the kind of things that they want.    We went to see  Rollerball  this afternoon.&nbsp; It was pretty good.&nbsp; I love Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (also Mystique of  X-Men ) ! &nbsp; I still think Chris Klein is cheesy -- no matter what other people say.&nbsp; He's kind of sucky as an actor.&nbsp; I can't fathom how he's landing all these acting jobs.

        1.   What's the most romantic thing you've ever done for someone else?    In '87, when I moved to DC, Kim stayed in Detroit with the kids for 4 months.  It was really hard being apart.  One weekend I flew home without telling her, had friends drop me at the restaurant two blocks from our house, and called and told her to come to the porch - I was having a present delivered.  I walked down the street and up the driveway.  She was in tears.    2.   [pardon the cosmo question] What are your erogenous zones?    Uh, the usual.    3.   How old were you the first time you had sex? Care to expound?    16.  On a church retreat with a bunch of kids I didn't know.  Fran was 17, and, to this day, the most unattractive girl I've ever been with.  I wasn't ready for this, and it showed.  Monumentally unsatisfying.   4.   What's the most unusual place you've ever had sex?    In an Amtrak sleeper room.  A little cramped, but still nice.    5.   Do you have plans for Valentine's Day or is it just another Thursday?    I'll be working.  Probably overtime.  Sometimes this job really sucks (like RIGHT NOW!  75 damn hours this week.  Aaagh!).  Besides, it'll be Lent.  No fun allowed.     Daf

       Finally, 33 years after I first heard "The Age of Aquarius", I saw "Hair" last night.  It was, of course, a bit dated - but it was aware of its datedness.  The movie was made in 1979, from a play first performed in 1967 or '68.  Directed by Milos Forman.   For all the hit music that came from this (Let the Sun Shine In, Good Morning Starshine, Easy to be Hard, AofA, Hair)  I was completely unprepared for how good the performances were going to be.  Whoever the girl was singing AofA at the opening positively roared!  Cheryl Barnes did a deep and beautiful Easy to be Hard, and even the ridiculous Good Morning Starshine (Glitty gloop gloppy...) - sung by Beverly D'Angelo, no less - had a gritty feel to it, helped along by some gospelly sounding harmonies from the other leads.   There was a lot of Broadway style filler and silliness, too - some pretty good, some just weird.  But the story line just blew me away - I had no idea what was coming at the end.  If you can get past the silly parts and the anachronisms, this is a powerful movie - Treat Williams, a Pan-style character through most of this, becomes Christlike at the end, John Savage is an excellent and unassuming everyman as Claude Bukowski,  Beverly D'Angelo is full of surprises as the society girl who gradually loses her frosty society ways and becomes a regular person.   Also interesting to see some TV celebs - Nell Carter, and the house mother from "Facts of Life".  And some guest vocals from Ronnie Dyson and Melba Moore.   The famous nude scene from the play isn't there, but Beverly shows her goodies a few times, and lots of guys get naked - including a very funny scene at the draft board.   Best part for me, though, was the music.  The "hit" songs sounded so much better in this movie than the bland versions from 5th Dimension, 3 Dog Night, and whoever that was who had the hit with "Good Morning Starshine" (ick!).   Now - if you guys want to make Daf feel REALLY old, just say something like "I've never heard of any of these songs or groups or people".   Where's my damn oatmeal?!   Daf

      Those were some interesting pictures.  Ive never imagined these electic peters would come in different sizes.  What was that game all about - Pass the Peter? Has anyone seen this Pinoy movie called "the debut"?  I've been tracking it for about a year now and for some reason they dont want to break into the New York Market.  They've finally placed screenings in the East Coast last Christmas out of all places Virginia.  Whats wrong with "the debut" producers that they dont want to cash in the movies worth in the larger Filipino Market in the East Coast?  Sorry for being such a pain but they began screening this movie called "Adobo" and it bombed in the reviews.    just putting my 2 cents into this.  Sex toys... coming to a small town near you.

      I was searching for a topic in a Filipino search engine when I ran across this reviewer's comments on Chingay's online diary. I clicked the link and I was hooked. Ching was honest and hid nothing. Often she commented on how she might get kicked off some webserver do to her content. ;)    Anyway, I read her entry about her various attractions and what it all meant. I responded to that entry w/ an e-mail. That began a very long daily e-mail correspondence in which I wrote her a litany of my survival. I sent her poems old and new. She sent me links to hers. I was drawn to her diaries, the way she was drawn to my e-mails. Often she convinced me to have my own website or online journal. I refused.   Soon we were snail mailing each other. I sent her books mailed in packages covered in rave cards or whatever I could find. I scrawled in the the margins of SF Bay Area independent weekly newspapers. We talked on the phone.    I joined her Yahoo! groups. I also joined an e-mail list group in which members took turning writing a bizarre story. If my memory serves me correctly, it was about an anti-hero who wanted to avenge the death of his pet boa who died as an adobo dish. The murderess was a bartender/songstress and a S&M dominitrax and a celebrity pet killer at large.   Really, I was a goner. I searched Chingay in various search engines. I downloaded her photos and saved them on discs. I wrote e-mails to her California suitor. I even sent her a postcard from Reno and even used the Carson City public library's internet access to contact her and tell her not to worry. I just had a little roadtrip and I was snowed in in Nevada.   We played Truth or Die on AOL Instant Messenger.   Yaddy, yaddah...then she broke my heart: She fell in love with Brian, insulted California, and refused to meet me. Well, actually, she felt lonely for Brian, she thought the Bay Area was very crowded unlike the open spaces of Kansas, and we could not arrange to meet. Anyway, I was crushed. I retreated from the Chingay Yahoo! club for a while. Then out of curiosity I checked it out again. Then whammo bammo, I'm naming one of her group blogs.

      I ran across Ching in one of my AL-ANON meetings.  Just kidding, I actually found her site on the web as I was searching for SKA on the web.  I ended up looking at a profoundly made site and was so curious that other Filipinos were as interested in Ska as was I.  I was known as VinzSka then and still now among certain circles but thats another story.  Ching invited me to her Beau Monde club and another group where we started telling this never ending story about a Cyborg and her Girlfriend.  Um er... or maybe thats another story yet again.  Anyway, Ching is Awesome as an internet friend. Altough we have never met face to face we have talked a great deal online and She and I have faced reality in our own sense.  Thank you for all those years, oh and I would also like to thank the ACADEMY... uh oh.. now Im just wasting time.  Okay theyre telling me to finish up...Okay thanks Mom!.   Peace out!    ~Net

       Glee,  I'm trying to remember, I think I stumbled across Ching's old Beau Monde club, followed the link to chingay.com, read some of her writings, and was hooked. She's always been a friendly, if elusive, part of my net travels since. Daf

       Happy Easter, you guys.   The death march is officially over.  Did my time sheet for the month today - 348 hours!  That's  180  hours of overtime.  Man, I never want to do that again.   Daf  (up for 33 hours straight yesterday and today)

      SHREK is my all-time favorite animated movie!  We saw ICE AGE several days ago, but I didn't think it was as good.  I like it, but I still liked SHREK better.  I still haven't seen MONSTERS INC.  We missed it completely when it came out in theaters.  We're waiting for it to be released on DVD so we can watch it.  I heard it's very good.  I still think SHREK will be my favorite for a while, though.    We saw RESIDENT EVIL last week.  It was awesome!  I love Mila Jovovich.  She's so hot!  Michelle Rodriguez was great, too... But she turned into a zombie!  Yikes!  We're planning on watching BLADE 2 this Monday.  I'm excited already!    BTW, I heard about Netflix.  Brian and I were seriously considering signing up.. After all, we are certified movie buffs.  The only thing is, you are limited to three DVDs at any given time.  They won't send you additional ones until you've returned some of the DVDs.. I don't know if they still have that rule.. But when we were thinking about it last year, they had that rule in place.  It kind of turned us off to the whole thing (Brian and I will rent five DVDs all at once sometimes -- yes, we really need to get a life).  Anyway, it helps if you have hook-ups at Hollywood Video.  You won't have to pay at all!! LOL.

      I found a site where one can borrow DVDs online.  Its called  urlLink NETFLIX.com  for less than 25 dollars a month, one can borrow DVDs and keep it for more than what Blockbuster will let you.  They deliver using the post office plus its guaranteed satisfaction.  I borrowed a couple of DVDs so far one didnt arrive and another was received damaged.  Not a problem, all one has to do is access the website and tell them the poor condition you had received the DVD and you will get a replacement.  This is a great deal! I borrowed Shrek tonight, cant wait its in the mail!  ~NET

      GLEE: If you are really serious about getting in touch with Oprah, you'll need to get a move on it because there are dozens of rumors floating around that she is calling it quits.&nbsp; There is no confirmation, but that's what I've heard.    SHE: I'm sure that you do a great job and have nothing to worry about.&nbsp; As for me, I will be unemployed and overweight.&nbsp; It sucks.    Anyway, if any of you want to see pictures.&nbsp; I have pictures at Brinkster.&nbsp;  Just follow the pink gingham.

      Thanks, for the HTML tags. I really need to brush up on them. My room is such a mess right now. It has my poetry, massage supplies, books, puclicity flyers, newspaper articles and clippings, clothes, etc. ARRRRGH! I really need to get organized. I'm so busy lately.   I used to average about 2 therapeutic massage clients a day. Now, I only get about one a week. I got in a car accident a coupla weeks ago. A teen driver rearended me. I now see the chiropractor 3 times a week. I got two job opportunities working at various spas, but because of my tight schedule, lack of reliable transporation, and my whiplash injuries, I had to decline job interview opportunities. Send good thoughts my way for speedy recovery, and hopefully I will be able to be able to build my therapeutic massage practice again.    After my book tour, I'm actually thinking about acting. Yeah, I saw a group of AIDS health educators performing a play called "Secrets." They all were over the age of 22. When I told them I want to join their cast, they got real excited. I told them that I have my book tour to finish and I have a huge event to produce so it will be a while before I can commit.    Oh, I have an opportunity to audition for an HBO spokenword/slam show. The only thing is that they are asking for 18-30 y.o. poets. I just turned 32. Martha, the hostess of the Listen & Be Heard open mic where I regularly read at, said that was "rude and ageist" and that I should "lie." Dammit, I look like a kid!

      Hello people! I'm glad the rest of the SMEAGHE are blogging already. Jeng was asking me why I haven't blogged in a while. I told her I am still somewhat depressed coz I haven't found a full-time job yet. I don't know what is up with everyone. Ching is it true that you'll lose your job at Spiegel? Jeng actually gave me a call today and she also said that her company will be relocating next month. She too will have to find a new job by the end of April. Oh well, hang in there and good luck with your job hunting. Cel, Congratulations! You're family and I are very thrilled to hear that you'll be graduating soon. I hope you got graduation money already. :)

      GLEE:&nbsp; It's really easy to add links and graphics.&nbsp; All you have to do is go into the "TEMPLATE" section to make your modifications.&nbsp; Locate the spot that you want to put your links/graphics and type away.&nbsp; The appropriate syntax is listed below.       FOR LINKS   &lt;A HREF="http://enter.url.here"&gt;Link Title&lt;/A&gt;     FOR IMAGES   &lt;IMG SRC="http://image.url.here"&gt;     FOR IMAGE LINKS   &lt;A HREF="http://enter.url.here"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC="http://image.url.here"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;      Try these and let me know if they work for you.&nbsp; If you have any problems, do not hesitate to holler.    By the way, I remember Rupert and I also remember "Anxiety Closet."&nbsp; I still think it's my favorite one.&nbsp; I suspect a lot of people feel the same way.

      Thanks, Ching!    Ching, I have several links and graphics I want to add to my blog. How do I add them to the side column? Is it possible to do that?     I'm so beat. I have gone to three poetry slams. I performed at two of them. I scored a 22 or 24 points out of a possible 30 when I performed "Anxiety Closet" at the Bezerkeley Slam. It was the host's birthday, and I gave him my only copy of the  Watershed  that was the first publication to publish my poem. I just had to let go of it. It was my security blanket for so long. "Anxiety Closet" is now on my friend's Leah's expressions section of her website.   I think I'm rivals with this guy named Jaime Kennedy. He's a three time National Slam poet and self-proclaimed "asshole." Jaime, Geoff Trenchard, and Rupert Estanislao (the last of the latter used to be my bf) are a slam poet group called the Suicide Kings. Jaime hosts the most obnoxious three-ring circus of a poetry slam called Tourettes without Regrets. If a poetry slam was part WWF and part Jerry Springer Show then you will have Tourettes. Jaime and his show was so notorious that he got kicked out of two cities, Benicia and Vallejo. He took his show and his followers to a bigger city called Oakland. Anyway, he's the epitome of what I don't want to be when I grow up.   Rupert is auditioning for my Vallejo spokenword corps called Phoenix Rising. I don't if how much he'll commit to it. He's so busy with being one of the house poets at Tourettes and he goes to almost every slam imagninable.    Is there a poetry slam in your area? An open mic?   My gf did some research and found two snail mail addresses for Oprah Winfrey.  Harpo Productions  P.O. Box 909715  Chicago, IL 60607   Oprah Winfrey Show 1058  W. Washington St. Chicago, IL   I'm still working on getting a P.O. Box.

       UPS came yesterday and left a slip stating that they attempted to deliver a package which required a signature.&nbsp; It said DKNY.&nbsp; I figured it was my watch.&nbsp; I left work early, too!&nbsp; We probably just missed them by a few minutes.&nbsp; Brian was saying that if he would have come home straight from work, instead of taking me to lunch, he could have been home to accept the package.&nbsp; Darn it.    The slip did state that a second attempt would be made the following day, Friday (today).&nbsp; I stayed home from work even though I could not afford it, to ensure that I would be home to accept my package.&nbsp; They came a little earlier than stated, but I was thrilled to finally have it.&nbsp; I saw it in the catalog two weeks ago and just had to have it.&nbsp; Actually a lot of people at work are going on shopping sprees because after our call center closes on May 17th and everyone is laid off, we won't be able to avail of our 30% merchandise discount any longer.

      I don't know if you guys have heard yet, but SGTS is closing the Spiegel call center in Wichita.&nbsp; As of May 17th, everyone is getting laid off.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; That includes me.&nbsp; The news broke on Tuesday.&nbsp; It was actually on all the local news channels.&nbsp; I'm looking for a new job.&nbsp; If any of you have any leads, I'm open to suggestions.    I took a partial day at work today.&nbsp; Left early.&nbsp; It's hard to be productive in times like these.&nbsp; It's like nothing matters anymore.&nbsp; On a lighter note, Brian and I finally got a chance to watch  Zoolander .&nbsp; It's hilarious!&nbsp; I highly recommend it.&nbsp; I told Brian that we have to own it on DVD because I enjoyed it so much.

      Welcome, Cel ! &nbsp; I'm glad to see that you're finally.&nbsp; We hope to hear from you soon.&nbsp; Jhayne has already posted a couple of messages.&nbsp; I think she's getting the hang of it.&nbsp; Much thanks to Sheryll for helping to get Jhayne connected.    Anyway, I thought I'd let you guys know (if you have not visited the domain --  urlLink http://www.goldensushi.net  -- yet) that we offering FREE EMAIL (you@goldensushi.net) and FREE HOSTING (http://www.goldensushi.net/~you) to all Golden Sushi members.&nbsp; Let me know if any of you are interested.&nbsp; Since I've got paid hosting and quite a bit of space, I figured I should share the wealth.&nbsp; There's no room for greedy people here.    The bad news is, you have to have some knowledge of HTML and FTP in order to use the space because I don't have a web editor (learn to use Notepad, gosh-darn-it ! ) or a web upload utility available for you.&nbsp; If you want to learn or need help, do not hesitate to holler.&nbsp; My inbox is always open 24/7.&nbsp; If you don't want to FTP, but would like to create your own web pressence -- I highly recommend  Brinkster .&nbsp; They give you 30MB (that's a lot of space, I promise you).&nbsp; They have a user-friendly web interface that allows you to upload files through your browser.&nbsp; No online editing tool, though.&nbsp; As far as creating your pages, you are on your own.&nbsp; Sheryll can help or I can help -- if you've got any questions.    Other news, Brian has purchased his own domain also (http://www.virtualdumpster.com/ -- it's not up yet, but it will be in a week).&nbsp; He'll be offering FREE EMAIL also.&nbsp; As for HOSTING, I think he'd decided to charge for it.&nbsp; The pricing that he was thinking of was very reasonable, though.&nbsp; So it's not like he's going to be asking an arm and a left for it.&nbsp; We'll keep you up-to-date on that.    Yesterday was a lot of fun.&nbsp; We went to our first pre-marital counseling session.&nbsp; It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.&nbsp; It was kind of nice actually.&nbsp; We talked about how Brian and I met and our families etc.&nbsp; We took home this booklet and we completed it last night.&nbsp; We're going to go over our answers in next week's session.&nbsp; Some of our answers were different, but I still think that Brian and I are totally compatible.&nbsp; No quiz or survey or test will change my mind on that.    We went to see  The Time Machine  right after.&nbsp; I loved it ! &nbsp; I love Guy Pearce ! &nbsp; He is so awesome ! &nbsp; It's hard for me to get into all the details, but I really enjoyed the movie.&nbsp; I'm not usually into sci-fi because it's all so implausible -- I just find myself questioning everything throughout the movie..&nbsp; This one was different, though.&nbsp; They really got me to buy it..&nbsp; That, my friend, is quite an accomplishment.&nbsp; I love that everything happened in the span of a week.&nbsp; I love the simultaneous time overlay in the ending.&nbsp; It was great !     After that we went to meet mom at the bowling alley.&nbsp; I offered to watch Logan while she bowled so she could play without distractions.&nbsp; Brian was excited about playing with Logan, too.&nbsp; We don't get to see him very often.&nbsp; I guess that's all for now.&nbsp; Happy blogging !

       Finally, after 2 years in the GIA pipeline (and another 3 1/2 languishing before that), "Joy" is published!  This is my first and only published piece - hope you don't mind if I get a little excited.    It's a gospel-style cantor + SATB piece, based on James 1.  It's available from   urlLink GIA publications   (now, I assume - I received the printed copies today), # G-5369.    They've published it as part of their Leavensong series, which is a new one on me - haven't seen this series before.    Anyhow, thanks to Malcolm the K, who convinced me to submit it, and to all of you, whose missives I look forward to every day, and help inspire me to write.  I am just so incredibly happy right now...    Jay

       FRIDAY FIVE!!      1. What makes you homesick? &nbsp; Watching "Beach Week" on the Travel Channel.     2. Where is "home" for you? Is it where you are living now, or somewhere else (ie: Mom & Dad's house, particular state/city)? &nbsp; I still consider the Philippines to be my home.&nbsp; I particularly miss Tanjay and the simple life.&nbsp; Mom and Dad built a new house there.&nbsp; The construction is complete and the landscaping is half-way done.&nbsp; It just needs to be furnished.&nbsp; I hope to take Brian there next year so he can see what it was like to grow up in the province.     3. What makes it home for you? People? Things? &nbsp; Everything.&nbsp; The people, the animals, the things..&nbsp; The sights, smells and sound.&nbsp; The food!&nbsp; I miss authentic Pinoy food so much!     4. Where is the furthest you've been from home, miles-wise? &nbsp; Here.     5. What are your plans for this weekend? &nbsp; Stripping wallpaper (some more), visiting Mom and checking out her new dining room ensemble..&nbsp; Watching  The Time Machine ..&nbsp; Getting Brian's hair cut at the mall..&nbsp; Redeeming yet another Express coupon.

      According to the test I have a lot of money. Well, a lot of people think I do. You don't go around saying that you make $20-65/ an hour, and you're also the producer of two major productions without really meaning it. I mean it. Ching, can remember all those years of me whining about my state of unemployment. Now, I'm my own boss, I create my own hours, I have enough time and money to do my creative endeavors and do a lot of community building and grassroots organizing.    Well, Ching, I got it up. It's http://www.dear_oprah@blogspot.com     I'll scan the logos and give you the links. Do you think you can help me out? I have several logos and links I'm associated with.    Daf, my mother still hasn't gotten back to me about Tagalog song lyrics. I will go bug her again.    Ching, have you been receiving my DEAR OPRAH e-mail newsletter? The rest of you guys if you want to know what's going on with poetry book tour and the Phoenix Rising, Vallejo's Premiere Spokenword Corps, then I suggest you subscribe to my DEAR OPRAH newsletter. You'll never know. Maybe we'll stop in near your area. :) To subscribe, e-mail dearoprah@yahoo.com and write "Subscribe" in the subject hearder.

      No.&nbsp;  I've decided to combine SMEAGHE and WEB CLOGGERS into one: GOLDEN SUSHI.&nbsp; The reason is that I find myself blogging the same thing on both blogs.&nbsp; This will save me typing.&nbsp; Plus, we all do not blog so regularly.&nbsp; People on SMEAGHE go on hiatus and people on WEB CLOGGERS go on hiatus and there will be weeks with no message postings at all..&nbsp; With just one blog, the gaps will be less frequent.&nbsp; Old  SMEAGHE Today  and  WEB CLOGGERS  posts will be available for as long as GeoCities wants to keep them open.

      Thanks  Ching  for making me feel better... the past two days were like hell. You know what i'm talkin about. I'm so thankful that we were able to talk again... its been years since we last talked about real personal stuff. There are times that im longing for someone to talk to, someone to confide my emotions, someone i can count on, or someone i can just laugh with... i miss having a best friend and all those longings were actually gone just few hours ago. I actually felt like you were just here...

      Sheryll!!  I can see you!  I was in the room at the same time as you are.  I kept typing messages, but you did not reply.  I'm worried that the chat might not be working properly... GRR!

      GLEE:  You won't have to download or install anything to your computer..  Just click on the link.    CHAT -- as far as the username and password; if you have not been there yet you will need to register a name for the chat.  Click on the "register here" link.  After you sign up, you should be good to go.  You'll use the same username and password to login to the chat every time.  I'm hoping that we can all chat as a group one day -- see if the thing really works.    SHE: You use the username and password that I emailed to you for the FTP.  If you deleted it, I can email it to you again.  Now you can upload your pictures through the web!  Cool, huh?    APRIL:  I have not set you up with webspace yet; but if you want to have your own space to FTP to just let me know and I will set it up.

Is that another thing that I have to download to my laptop just to watch it crash?  sarcasm    Looks like Glee is going to need a new computer. Thank gawd it can be considered a business expense or a donation for my nonprofit. :)

       Ching, I read a Moulin Rouge review that said the movie was proof that even "strange, enchanted boys" (i.e., Ewen McGregor, referring to his theme song) want to nail Nicole Kidman...    If you're so inclined, go to  urlLink GIA  and search on "Jay" - you'll get one hit.  There's supposed to be a sample pdf, but I couldn't see it - might need a newer Acrobat Reader.

      Hi, you guys! I don't know where I left off. I hardly watch tv or movies lately. I'm too busy with other commitments that any travelling that is not related to massage therapy or spoken word and/or arts events are just out of the question.    As you can tell, I'm beat. Plum exhuasted. I've been juggling my therapeutic massage practice, organizing for a huge poetry and arts festival, and founding Vallejo Phoenix Rising--a touring spoken word group that will promote the local arts organizations and raise funds for publications and other performance poetry productions.    Bad news. My girlfriend dumped me. It was no surprise. It was my fault. The distance. The fact that our parents would totally oppose our relationship. The fact that I'm bound in Vallejo cuz the finances are not picking up. Oh, and I cheated on her. [hisssss, hisss, BOOOO] Yeah, I feel like shit. I'm going to crawl into a cave and die now...

      APRIL: Friday Five is at  urlLink fridayfive.org ..    DAF: I've seen all of the movies that you listed except for  Moulin Rouge , which for some reason or other Brian has no desire to watch.  I, on the other hand, am a major Nicole Kidman fan.  I'm anxious to see it.  Perhaps I'll be able to convince Brian to rent it one day.  We've got that rent-one-get-one-free deal at Hollywood Videos through the 15th of May, anyhow.  I loved  Bridget Jones Diary  (very funny) and  Rock Star  (nostalgic)..  Ice Age  was okay.  I didn't think it was nearly as good as  Shrek .   Tailor of Panama  was alright.  It put Brian to sleep.  I actually stayed awake through the whole thing, but despite the merits of the story the movie had slowed down considerably at certain parts.  I didn't find it as enjoyable as other similar Pierce Brosnan (spelling?) movies.    By the way, in the process of installing chat, I came across a free web upload utility so I'm pleased to announce that Golden Sushi now boasts web upload compatibility!  Hip! Hip! Hurrah!  You won't need not install WS_FTP or CuteFTP.. You just need to click on the link and voila!  Instant upload capability!  Whooppee!

       Here's what we saw lately - Bridget Jones (excellent!!!), Moulin Rouge (mostly fun - really liked the DVD's "you pick the view" feature on the extra dance bits), Rock Star (not as bad as it was supposed to be, and the new tunes were pretty good if you like hair metal), The Tailor of Panama (disappointing - really liked the book), and Ice Age (at the theater - fun mostly).   Anyone else?   Daf

      By the way,  The Scorpion King  sucked!&nbsp; If you must see it, wait for the DVD/VIDEO release.&nbsp; The imagery was good, but the dialogue sucked.&nbsp; It was like they didn't even try.&nbsp; Brian says that had to keep the lines simple of the The Rock.&nbsp; LOL!

       Sheryll wanted to post this picture of her two little boys, Steffano and Cameron.&nbsp; The older one (Steffano, right) is my  inaanak , who I owe mucho mucho gifts big time.    By the way, She, I changed my mind..&nbsp; Instead of uploading it to the Golden Sushi site like I said in the email, I uploaded it to your space.&nbsp; The actual URL of the picture is  http://www.goldensushi.net/~she/nokncam.jpg .&nbsp; Once you get your FTP program installed, you can upload more pictures to your personal space and link to them in the same manner.    DAF, your "crooked nose" post makes me think of Owen Wilson (of  Shanghai Noon ,  Zoolander ,  Behind Enemy Lines  fame).&nbsp; It's his signature look!    My biggest abnormality is my greenish mole on my right arm.&nbsp; It's huge!&nbsp; I think it's gotten bigger as I've grown older.&nbsp; Thankfully, it's not cancerous!

       Hmm.   1 - huge belly on an otherwise skinny frame - yuck!  Anyone remember the Timbertoes from Children's Highlights?  That's me.   2 - I had an extra bone in each foot.  Blocked my arch, had it removed when I was 13.  End of my football career, except that I already told you how I was built.  The career would have gone away anyhow.   3 - crooked nose - or maybe asymmetrical is a better word.  More syllables anyhow.  It's just not centered right on my face.   4 - see the   RABBIT BLOG  .  Then read the URL.  the shame, the shame...  Nice blog, though.   Daf (who has more, but he's really bumming himself out).

I registered in Assumption College and Saint Francis, too. Hope to see your names there. You can also view lists of students, faculty or employee in other schools so if you've been hunting a person, you might see the name there then you may send a message to him through that site, just click on the school where that person went to.

Anyhoo, I might give her a call when I visit Jeff this weekend.  I still need to buy a phone card.       Ching:  To my dearest webmaster thanks for helping me out once again with my blog!

      I've justified everything, Pia.&nbsp; All of your entries will automatically be justified.&nbsp; Let me know if there is anything else that I can do.    SHERYL, you will need to download and install the FTP program first because that is the only way that you will be able to access the FTP site.&nbsp; Once you've installed the FTP program, you just need to plug in the information that I have given you and then you can upload to your heart's content.    Wow!&nbsp; 70,000 PHP just for Nursery?&nbsp; I'm afraid to ask how much grade school and high school tuition are..&nbsp; Talk about inflation?!&nbsp; Education didn't cost that much when we were growing up.&nbsp; At least, I didn't think so.

By the way, Nokee will be studying here this coming school year and the tuition fee for Nursery is PHP70,000.      PIA:  If you are already sure that you and Jeff arent comin home this July. I suggest you tell Cel coz she doesn't want to look for a stable job yet. She wants to get a job to save money then resign when you get here. She has a lot of plans already. I'm dissapointed but its okay, though. You can come home anytime you like this year but my best friend's wedding is only once. You better opt to attend Ching's wedding than come home. I envy the people who will witness Ching's wedding. That is gonna be the happiest day of her life and I am hoping I can be a part of it.

Is it also possible to justify the description on the side (where my short self-description goes)?  Sorry if I sounded so anal about this. I just wanted everything to be uniform. Thanks again! :)     Sheryll:  Nope, I am not sure anymore if I will be going back there in July. Jeff will be teaching summer school and Ching's wedding is in the beginning of August. I may not have enough time to travel back.  My whole family is planning a big reunion in the beginnning of August which I may not be able to attend to as well. It is a bummer I know but since I am only working part-time, I can't afford to pay for all my travel plans. Nothing is definite yet but, I will keep you guys informed if ever Jeff and I decide to go back.

      Our friend Karen had not yet seen Episodes IV, V, VI of the Star Wars series so we had a Star Wars movie marathon last night.&nbsp; Man was I sleepy!&nbsp; I ended up sleeping through parts of my favorite Episode (VI)..&nbsp; Bummer!&nbsp; We're going to watch Episode I again soon -- all in preparation for the movie release of Episode II.&nbsp; Can you feel the excitement yet?

       PIA:  You can justify your posts manually by using the ALIGN attribute.  Example:    &lt;DIV ALIGN="justify"&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;P ALIGN="justify"&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;    Or, if you want it justified automatically I can set it in the template (less typing for you).  Let me know which way you want to do it.

       Ching:  Thanks for all the help. Don't worry I will keep your advice in mind whenever I post some pictures up in my blog.  BTW, I was just wondering if there is any way keep my blog posts justified.  I thought it would look more uniform and pleasant if my post were all aligned.

       PIA:  If you have the pictures one on top of the other (as you do on your blog), it looks nicer when the widths are the same.  If you have the pictures along a horizontal line, it looks nicer when the heights are uniform.  Here's the lazy way to achieve this:    If the pictures are of different sizes, you can just specify the width (or height) and the browser will do the rest.    It's actually better if you specify both sizes, but if you don't specify the sizes correctly you end up paying the price in picture quality.  At any rate, when you resize your pictures in a photo editor, keep them under 500 pixels.

       Sheryll:  I was checking out your guestbook from your SIS Chinese website and I recognized one of the names.  I think that guy Oliver Alvarez went to the same church with me when I was younger. If I am not mistaken I think he lives somewhere in Moonwalk close to our church.  Ask him if he knows my uncle, Onie Hernaez (Leslie's dad).  I took the liberty to check out the teacher's profile and I remembered his face. Oh well, what a small world.  I just thought I'd tell you. :)

      PIA:  I fixed the pictures that you posted in your blog so that they are uniform in width (also, so it's not blurry due to the rescaling).  Check it out, you'll see the difference.

SHE: I'm still working on web upload capability.  I'm looking for a cheap (or free, even better) script that is secure and easy to install.  At this time I have not found any so you will need to use an FTP program like WS_FTP or CuteFTP.

         CHING:   I'm really sorry for the mess. I found out that i kept on forgetting the unquote thing. I've learned my lesson, though. I should be chechin the HTML tag first before hittin post n publish.     Visitors signin in wait for my approval before the guestbook publishes it. Thanks for signing, i'll be postin it after I blog. Can u pls explain more about the golden sushi thing. Is that a free space for a site? or just an add-on to my site like the guestbook? My problem is, I don't have a landline so I can't access the net at home. I do it here in school but in a network so the ftp program won't work. Only the MIS people know the IP address. Is there any other way I can upload it? via site for example?

I am cancelling my account with AOL and I have to upload all the stuff I linked to this blog.  Dot's friends from Buffalo are coming to NYC this weekend.

       SHE:  I wasn't sure what was going on with the email but I think I solved the problem. Just check out  my blog   because I posted some pictures up as Jane requested.  If I am not mistaken, I think Jeng already forwarded you some of the other pictures that I intended to send you.  It should all be the same pictures.  It all came from Jeff's digital camera.  Next week, Jane and Jhoi will be hanging out with me for my birthday so, I should be taking more pictures then.     CHING:  Thanks for the advice regarding the pictures. I wasn't sure how to measure it by pixels. I'll try my best to post smaller images.  What do you think of the ones I posted in my blog?

      SHE:  I signed your guestbook, but my post would not show up!  It's a lovely site, BTW.  You did an awesome job!  Let me know if you want free space on GOLDEN SUSHI and I will set you up a username and password (of your choice) just like Pia.  That way you won't have to deal with the GeoCities Ad Square anymore.  The only downside is you will need to download an FTP program to upload to your space.  The space is available for you if you want it.  Just let me know.

      IMPORTANT NOTE: (I think NET learned this the hard way..) When adding a link please remember to include the closing quote ( " ) because if you forget to close the quote, the computer thinks that everything that follows after is part of the link -- thus messing up the EDIT link.    PIA: Concerning pictures, use your best judgement.  My advice is to resize to a size that will fit the browser.  About 500 by 500 pixels is a good size.  If you are posting the pictures in GOLDEN SUSHI, 350 by 350 (or smaller) would be ideal.  If you are posting pictures in your own blog, you might go smaller so as not to ruin the table layout.

I thought it you did a very good job considering the fact that you only worked on it in a day or two.      Ching:  When you mean resizing the pictures, you meant resizing it through something like Adobe Photoshop, correct?

A woman will pay $1 for a $2 item that she doesn't need.    GENERAL EQUATIONS & STATISTICS  A woman worries about the future until she gets a husband.  A man never worries about the future until he gets a wife.  A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend.  A successful woman is one who finds such a man.    HAPPINESS  To be happy with a man, you must understand him a lot and love him a little.  To be happy with a woman, you must love her a lot and not try to understand her at all.    LONGEVITY  Married men live longer than single men, but married men are a lot more willing to die.    PROPENSITY TO CHANGE  A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn't.  A man marries a woman expecting that she won't change, and she does.    DISCUSSION TECHNIQUE  A woman has the last word in any argument.

      Monday night I closed Cardio Tan and Matt and Jude came to visit me.  Well at 11:00pm we decided to lock the front doors then we went to the back dock to smoke.  I locked us all out and when we tried to get back in it set off an alarm.  I ended up having to wake one of my bosses' to get a key since I had locked everything inside including my cell phone and my keys.  It was so scary.  Now that I think about it I'm glad Matt didn't leave his keys in there or we would have been screwed, he was the one that drove me to my boss' house.  Everyone at work thought it was funny including both my bosses, and the alarm ended up being the for the business next door.  The whole time though I was thinking that the cops would be there by the time I had got the keys and they would have busted the glass doors already.  Whew!  I still cringe thinking about it.    By the way, I put Matt and Jude in our $30,000 tanning beds and ended up frying both of them.  They are still burnt and bitching to this day.  He!  He!  He!  Jenni

      Eloi went back home coz' they found it difficult to be on their own yet. Both of them don't have stable jobs so the income is not consistent which is har if you have consistent bills coming in.  Clay is still working in a hotel, he is on a permanent status so things are going pretty well. He has not graduated yet but he was able to produce a fake diploma through my cousin's friend.

       PIA: &nbsp;  The picture size is fine.&nbsp; It appears to be proportionate.&nbsp; Just a reminder, though..&nbsp; GeoCities does not allow you to link to images saved on their server.&nbsp; It shows up for you because the image is already cached on your computer, but it just shows an "X" in the corner for everyone else.&nbsp; Since you sent me Cel's graduation picture, I took the liberty of uploading it to your space.&nbsp; I changed the image source from HTTP://WWW.GEOCITIES.COM/PIAE16/CELGRADPIX.JPG to just CELGRADPIX.JPG both here and in your personal blog.&nbsp; You can upload more stuff by using an FTP program (you should already have WinFTP installed in your computer, I believe it comes standard in all Windows platforms).&nbsp; If you do not like WinFTP, you can easily download CuteFTP.&nbsp; It's very popular and it's readily available.&nbsp; Check your email for the FTP info (ftp site, user name and password)..&nbsp; I'm emailing it to you right now.

      Okay Ching! I don't know why the picture looks uneven. I already tweaked the width and the height to make it look better when it is posted but my efforts didn't work at all. Please edit my post again and let me know what height and width you used to post Cel's picture up. Thanks!

      Having perused the online garage sale... It gave me some ideas to put some items up for bids.  Take notice of these nostalgic Haloween candy.  Having been salvaged from my manhattan apartment.  They still retain the goodness of trick or treating.  Actually, I do believe I tried to pawn them off a year ago as Easter Candy.  Whao! has it been that long?  How about some cheese? This next item up for bid has been rescued for the cupboards upper deck.  I was going to hand them out as noshes on the dining table when it was lost but now found!  It was originally bought when ODD JOB had the items on sale.  Any bids will be delightfully welcome. Some caution comes to mind.  Take note that these items were left in my apartment since Sept 11.  It has seen the light yet again when I moved back to Queens.  I did partake on some of the cheese which is still shrink wrapped and protected with aluminum foil.  Aw heck who wants this stuff anyway?  I take it back.. BIDS Over!!!  Stop... no more bid please!  Maybe some neighborhood cats will want it.. Ill just leave it out to 'pastuer' in the nearby Park.  There has to bee some hungry pigeons out there.  (_)_) ~Net

      Vacation is over and I'm back to work!!! It's sad coz I have to leave my kids again with their yaya. I know my kids hate the idea, too. Everytime I take a bath, Nokee goes "Mommy, work ka?" If I say "no", he smiles at me. But, if I say "yes" he will answer me "No, daddy lang work. Ayaw to work ka." He's still bulol and he mixes English and Filipino in a sentence. He is actually confuse between the two languages. Me and Clay speak to them in English but their yaya and everybody else talk to them in Filipino. That is why we are so eager to enroll him for the coming school year... we want him to be with more people who would talk to him in English. We want our kids to be really good in communication.      Genevieve Amador's 28 year old-brother died few days ago. Eloi, Mhyke, Joeben and Cel went to my place to pick me up but I wasnt able to go with them coz my kids were not feeling well and I had to take care of them. I called Eloi the day after that, she told me that they had a great time with the boys (Elmer Dimayuga, Chris Caylan, Lou Natanawan, Mike Santuile and Joeben Yap). They just played billiards after going to the wake. They are planning to go out gain this coming Friday. Im really hoping things will go well at home so I can go out.

      I'm in!  I'm in!  Mwa ha ha ha ha!  Whew!  Hey, Ching did you notice that I got in!  Congratulate me.  Anyway, I actually got some sleep last night.  Partly because I didn't call Michael.  I figured if he needed something he'd call but probably not since it was Friday night and he probably went out with his buddies.  I'm thinking of going to San Diego.  Any comments I can get on that.  I mean I don't really have a lot of free time, hell, I probably should just run to Lawrence instead.  I think I'm going to Lawrence next weekend then.  Man, I so need a break.  You know what they brought to my attention yesterday.  Ghaison and Harley said I space out a lot.  I never noticed it before but I do get distracted so easily.  I can't believe I've lost my brain cells.  Can you guys help me find them, please?  Well, like I said not a lot of free time here so I should go.  Maybe do some homework or something.  Everybody wish me luck on getting my brain cells back.

      I scanned it at 170 dpi then reduced scanned image to like 33.3 percent. APRIL  I think that your scanners default dpi preferences is too high.  Just adjust that attribute and you can be a scanning guru.  Its official, I am now a stand by  wedding guest.  Dot received her friend Linda's Wedding invitation and I am not on the card.  The invitation didnt even say "Dorothy '-and Guest' ".  Although I am not close to this Linda fellow, does she expect Dorothy go to the wedding just by herself?  -More to come...    (_|_) Net

      Welcome to Golden Sushi Jimbo and Congrats to your upcoming high school graduation!    Ching:  You don't have to borrow the cd from Jimbo. You can download "Phantom of the Opera's  All I ask of you  at  WinMX .   Try it, that is where I get most of my songs...I never had to buy any cds anymore. Although I do have the entire musical soundtrack for Phantom of the Opera. I love that musical. You should have told me...I could have burned you a copy and sent it to you today along with your gift.

I think I'm going to try and move my files from geocities over to goldensushi, maybe to try to get away from the stupid ads that show up all the time. Anyway, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Jimbo, I'm 18, just graduating from High School...(Commencement is in 8 days!) and I'm one of Ching's Pinoy friends from Wichita, you could say, a friend of the family.  Glad to join the group!  -Jimbo

       There are scenes in the new "Star Wars" movie, scenes conceived, written and played with fearful awkwardness or tension (as if the filmmakers themselves had never got past that wall of adolescent fear and ignorance) in which the light plays on Ms. Portman's exposed shoulders and Mr. Christensen's pouting mouth, where any kid in today's audience knows the code and what ought to be coming. But the movie never gets it on. Oh sure, these kids will marry at the close of the film (they have to -- we know they're destined to be parents to Luke and Leia), but their skins never close and wrestle. Somehow, in 2002, George Lucas is still a virgin, and he wants his audience in the same stricken state.      urlLink Hmm... &nbsp; What an interesting take on the movie..

       April:  I am sorry to hear about your situation. I would suggest that you confide with someone you can trust that way you won't feel as depressed. I think it is a great idea to get tested just to make sure that you didn't catch anything from your ex. It is always better to be cautious about things. Just hang in there...things will definitely be better because you did make the right decision to leave someone whom you couldn't trust.

      k..im not really sad, more like very disappointed. LOUiEY is now my ex. oFFiciaLLy and definite. *sigh* he attempted to cheat on me wed nite. i had an iLL premonition of sum sort, but i cant believe what he'd done... or tried to. he actually rented a motel for him & his goddaughter's mom, JEN. she knew that i wouLdnt listen 2her unless i saw it with my own eyes. weLL, he was soo mad when i confronted him that he went aLL violent. to stop him from hitting anything - me, my car, or his - (we were in front of his house) i held on him like a claw. he would accidently hit me, but then he'd become worse and actually intentionally hit me. he told me the girl lured him there....to borrow money. i knew it wasnt true bec he couldnt face me, look me in the eye, and he smelled smoke. he never smoked...well, not that i now of. the biggest bad thing tho wus why at a motel. he never put me in a hotel. he offered her money for her bills etc. while i paid for most his bills. im not crying, im pass that, u guys. im not even angy. just confused and hurting from the bruises i received. i was soo dumb! i said sorry for kicking his ass too coz i dont belive anybody should do that to anybody. it felt good, and that's why maybe i feel so bad about it. its really over and i dont feel anything  but numbness. i cant even tell my real friends yet... you guys know because i dont know u that well, and maybe you wont call me stupid. his family stood there while he threw his shoe at me. his friends covered for him and said he would never do that... he loves me daw. poeple ive helped so many times knew but didnt say anything until it was jen he tried to victimize. wow, nobody cares. inside i was screaming, someone help me...defend me...give me a hug...  im scared that he mite have done this before... u know i could catch a disease. im scheduling my appt as soon as i get my stuff from his room. i put all the pictures/clothes there, and i think i should take them with me. am i wrong about this? gosh, i screwed up big time. why do i feel as if ill be paying for this for a long while...thanx 4reading this.

I think it'll be great to visit  PageResource .  I am sure you know most of the basics since you can do all the marquee and fancy images.  The best way is to look at other people's blogs so you can see how they are made. I have a number of links in my blog. Check them out!

          Daf at the Movies:    Spiderman -- Tobey Maguire was brilliant - in Ciderhouse Rules.  Not in S'man, where he made a reasonably compelling geek, but didn't manage to work in the wise-cracking aspect of his character very well.  I just kept thinking "this is NOT Peter Parker".  And KD as MJ - uh uh.  The real (Stan Lee version) MJ is a saucy, vibrant woman.  KD can't seem to get past high school sweetie-pie.  Neve Campbell (Mmmm...) would've been way better.  Plus, she's a REAL redhead...  or at least a more convincing fake.  All that being said, it WAS entertaining.  Nice job updating the "Why I fight crime" story.  And the special effects were cool - not so much believable as effective-in-transporting-us-to-comicbookland.   Mothman Prophecies -- Excellent drama.  Edge of our seats (well, it was a drive-in, so not exactly) through the whole movie.  Richard Gere was great, in a not-your-usual-Richard-Gere role.  So was the female lead (not Deborah Messing, but the blonde cop, whose name I didn't catch).  Not the kind of thing we would have ever picked to go see (double feature with Spidey), but a really thought-provoking film, exciting script, quality cast.    DVDs:    Seven Year Itch -- Way dated.  Marilyn Monroe is NOT the star of this, but is excellent as a foil for the lead's (forget his name) flights of fancy.  OTOH, the lead, reprising his Broadway role, continued to play to the cheap seats, and hammed it up way too much.  And his wanderings into fantasyland, sort of a "Walter Mitty discovers sex" concept, were borderline inanity.  Still, if you love all things Marilyn, there's some stuff to like.   The Producers -- Mel Brooks' best work, and one of his earliest.  Especially nice because he hadn't discovered his "formula" yet, so he actually told a story, without stopping for asides or cheap laffs.  Mostel and Wilder were brilliant, but the story was the real star.  Ken Mars and Dick Shawn were a little over the top, but it added to the fun.  Ching, if you're skipping Mel's stuff 'cos it's all so predictable, SEE this one.  One of the funniest movies ever made.  It is, however, a 60's movie, and not a 70's movie, so there's a lot of hopelessly outdated looks at sexual roles.  They don't ruin the movie, though, and are surprisingly "reminiscent" of some scenes from Austin Powers.   It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World -- Hahahahaha!  Great slapstick humor, filled with everyone-who-was-anyone in early 60's comedy - including, again, Dick Shawn.  Spencer Tracy was great, Milton Berle (reminding me, oddly, of Jeff Goldblum), Mickey Rooney, Ethel Merman, Jonathon Winters, Phil Silvers - all brilliant.  Cameos from stars like Jerry Lewis, the 3 Stooges, and Jim Backus add to the fun.  This was the basis for last year's Rat Race (haven't seen yet).  It's long, but definitely worth the time.

       Ching:  Thanks for fixing up my blogger tags. I can't believe how stupid I was fiddling around with my layout. I think I will invest on buying another computer soon coz I swear it always lags on me. Anyhoo, now I understand the power of those darn jibberish! I don't think I'll do anything with those tags anytime soon. I'm going to have to consult with you first! ~hehe~ Thanks for calling and taking the time to once again save my big behind!

      PIA, your blog is now fixed.  I could not remember exactly how it was configured so it there might be some minor differences.  I tried to restore it to its original state as best I could.  Thankfully, this boo-boo was fixable. The blogger tags just got deleted was all.  I just needed to put it back and configure the formatting.  Feel free to play with the code, just be careful not to erase the blogger tags.  They might look like jibberish, but they're there for a reason!  And if you are worried that something might have gotten typed over and can't remember how to fix it, always hit cancel!  (Just some words of wisdom from someone who has been there, done that and messed all sorts of other things up.. It's the best way to learn HTML, though, that's for sure!)

       Ching:  Thanks for signing my guestbook and for hooking my cousin Min with a free space here at Golden Sushi. I'm sorry to hear that you are now unemployed. Don't worry, you'll find another job soon! With you talents, I doubt that you will wait too long to find a job that you like. When one door closes, another one opens so keep your head up and enjoy your extra time with Brian and Hobbie! :)    Min:  Welcome to Goldensushi. Feel free to blog here with us as much as you can. It'll save me some money since I don't have to call you long distance anymore (hehe) :). BTW, thanks for the background for my blog. My weblog looks even better now. :) Much love to Ashlye for me!

       Ching  Thanks for fixing my blog archives for me. It looks great! Yeah go ahead and install a new guestbook for me on Sunday. I'll just tell everyone again to sign it. I like the idea of being able to respond to the guestbook post. In regards to the webcam, I think I'll think about it a little more. I sometimes use my webcam to chat with Jeff through yahoo messenger and I do that while I blog. I am not sure if I can do that anymore if I had the webcam in my blog. Anyhoo, did i just confused you? Well good luck with your job hunting. Thanks a lot for all your help! :)

      PIA:  The new guestbook will not have the old messages.  You will have to start from scratch..  But you will have the ability to respond to entries just like I do with the Golden Sushi guestbook.  I'm kind of busy with job searches right now, but if you want it, just let me know.. I will install it for you on Sunday.    If the webcam is the same size that I use in Golden Sushi, it should not make the page load longer.  You can download the Webcam 32 software at the same place that you downloaded the WS_FTP software.    P.S. I fixed your archives to the way you like it already.  Let me know what you think of it.

      I will be offering domain hosting soon.&nbsp; I'm informing members first because once I launch the web design/development section of Golden Sushi the hosting prices will go up.&nbsp; Members still get their free hosting  (http://www.goldensushi.net/~you) ; that will not change..&nbsp; But if you want to upgrade to domain hosting  (http://www.yourname.com) , now is the time to do it!       For only  $50/year  you'll get the following:    30MB disk space  12GB  UNLIMITED EMAIL ACCOUNTS  FTP ACCESS, WEB UPLOAD UTILITY  NO ADS, TECH-SUPPORT  Just about everything you can imagine!          GeoCities  charges  $8.95/month  plus a $15 set-up fee for less features.&nbsp; This truly is an excellent deal!&nbsp; I won't charge you any set-up fees or anything like that.&nbsp; If you've already got your own domain name, then all you will be responsible for is the  $50/year  (THAT'S ABOUT  $4/month  -- AT THIS RATE, YOU CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT) hosting fee.&nbsp; If I have to register your domain for you, it's an additional  $20/year  (or $30 for two years -- a $10 savings).&nbsp; Again, the rates will go up after the Golden Sushi hosting launches.&nbsp; This same offer will be $70/year without domain registration and $100/year with one year of domain registration (the rates are still very competitive, compared to other webhosts like GeoCities as you can see)..&nbsp; But I'm offering a deal to those who want get in on it before the hosting launch.     Interested parties please email me (webmaster@goldensushi.net) ASAP!

      Ching, you'd love this scene I'm caught up into right now. Rafael's Bar is like the best kept secret in V-town, Vallejo, CA for those not hip to West Coast rap.    Yes, I have done my share of drinking, April. Joe, the Rafael's owner--a  fine pinoy brother who is single BTW, keeps hooking all us up with shots of GOODNESS-KNOWS-WHAT. He also cooks kick-ass filipino and american food in his joint.   I LOVE WHAT I DO! I'm the in-house poet of the most happening scenes in all of Vallejo, I'm a founder of a touring spoken word group, I'm going to be a Reiki Master, and...and...and [*panting* running out of breath]. Oh, and my girl and I are back together again. She is soo sweet. I'm gonna kick myself if I ever hurt again.   I need to call up an attorney so I can I draw up a release form so that I can use Oprah's name for my book title. Since when poets could afford lawyers?   Speaking of Oprah, did you know she was on the cover of FORTUNE magazine? This is the woman I'm supposed to draw up legal papers for? [shivers in fright]   Ching, I will try to chat once I get another computer. I feel weird chatting at the public library computer center.   Monty Python is da bomb! I love the movie THE MEANING OF LIFE. "just one thin mint..."   Angelina Jolie is hot, but then again, I have this secret admiration for freaky, outspoken, weirdoes with amazing talent. Well, then again, her boobs aren't nothing to yawn about. :P' ' '      Someone called me "a giant freak" the other day. I told him, "I resent that! I only stand four foot eleven!"

       Don't feel bad, Ching - Kim didn't think much of History of the World either - or Spaceballs, or Young Frankenstein, or Blazing Saddles, or Men in Tights.  Or Caddyshack, or Porky's, or Animal House.  There's hope for her though, she liked Blues Brothers and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum and The Holy Grail.  I'm betting she'll like Mad Mad World and The Producers, too - I'll let you know.  We'll check out The Restoration, too.  Daf

      Brian loves Monty Python!&nbsp; He actually made me watch "History of the World I" -- it was okay.. I liked it, but I don't think I enjoyed it as much as he did.. He can just watch that stuff over, and over, and over, and over again.     The Restoration  is really good.  You should rent it.  I promise that you won't be disappointed.  Brian wasn't.

Speaking of the 70's, Have you guys checked out urlLink Dr. Chan and the amazing Chan Clan   cartoon on the Boomerang network?  What a cheezy spoof on chinese characters.

       Wishlist report:  Spent Mom's birthday check at Amazon.  Here's the haul:   VHS  The Producers  The Seven-Year Itch  The Princess Bride  DVD  It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World  CD  Chick Corea and Return To Forever - Light As A Feather  Santana - Welcome  Santana - Festival  Medeski, Martin, and Wood - Combustication  Boz Scaggs - Boz Scaggs  Mountain - Greatest Hits  Except for Princess Bride and MM&W, these are all 70's or earlier.  Not all have stood the test of time - Festival is not nearly as good as I remember, nor is the Mountain CD (which replaces two LPs, "Climbing" and "Nantucket Sleighride" that were swiped when I was in HIGH SCHOOL).  However, "Welcome" is still brilliant, so is "Light As A Feather".  Both are Latin flavored pop jazz at its' finest (take THAT, Supreme Beings of Leisure!)  And Boz's best album is still his first - from back when they knew how to make a song interesting for 12 minutes.  I'll review the movies after we watch 'em.  Daf

       Aaah!  I forgot my favorite (period piece or not) - "The Holy Grail"!  Sad that MP never equaled that in their later work.  I saw an interview - some of their best bits came out of budget necessities, including the coconuts (which begat the air-speed-of-a-fully-laden-swallow bit, which saved the bridgekeeper bit...).  Anyhow, I could have just edited my last post, but the Grail deserves its own space.  Funniest damned thing I've ever seen.  Daf

       Sorry - when I said AJ was "quite a screen presence", I was NOT just talking about her mommy parts.  She is very powerful.  Kim was disturbed by the movie, I think - eroticism and cruelty may be an effective combination, but also pretty discomforting.  Braveheart was good, but I liked Rob Roy better.  Probably because Liam Neeson is just so awesome.  I'm not familiar with "The Restoration", and am more familiar with Downey's tabloid escapades than his movie work, though he did a brilliant portrayal of my brother-in-law's umfriend, or someone just like him, in "Home for the Holidays" (one of MY favorites).  Other cool period pieces: Fellini's Casanova, The Lion in Winter, A Man for All Seasons, King of Hearts, History of the World Part I...  Daf

      JAY -- no kidding!&nbsp; Drew was really a crappy mom in that movie.&nbsp; I hated her character.&nbsp; She was soo stupid!     Chocolat  is very, very good!&nbsp; I really enjoyed watching it.&nbsp; Of course, I had to convince Brian to rent it -- that was a total struggle.&nbsp; His reluctance was the main reason we didn't get to see it in theaters when it first came out.&nbsp; Got to see it on DVD eventually -- we ARE movie buffs after all.&nbsp; Brian admitted that he enjoyed it also afterwards.&nbsp; I had to tease him for giving me such a difficult time.    I think I liked  Original Sin  more than you did, Daf.&nbsp; I'm a big Angelina Jolie fan!&nbsp; And not just of her boobs.&nbsp; That's probably the difference.&nbsp; You got to see a lot of Antonio Banderas' ass in that movie!&nbsp; They got very, very naked..&nbsp; I was totally surprised!    Our most recent rental was  The House of Mirth , based on the Edith Wharton novel.&nbsp; I had to talk Brian really hard into renting that one.&nbsp; He hates period pieces.&nbsp; He only likes them if there's blood and gore.&nbsp; His favorite period pieces?&nbsp;  Braveheart  (which is everyone's favorite),  The Patriot ,  Gladiator , and the like..&nbsp; I think the only exception would be  The Restoration  which does not have blood and gore (unless you consider the plague factor).&nbsp; It's one of my favorite movies and I forced him to watch it.&nbsp; He protested quite a bit, but Robert Downey Jr.'s incredible acting ability made him change his mind.

       DVD report:  Can't remember if I mentioned some of these before - apologies If I'm repeating myself...  Riding in Cars with Boys.  Pure chick flick.  Some heavy moments.  Strange watching Drew Barrymore as a brunette.  Wanted to like her character, but she WAS a really crappy mom.  Also strange to see James Woods playing a more-or-less nice guy.  Chocolat.  Way cool.  Very nicely done dig at repressive society (played here by my beloved Catholic Church - but I'll get over it  ), but ultimately a positive message, and the priest and the repressed count and the libertine chocolatire and the redeemed abused wife and the lonely repressed widow and the gypsy hunk all live happily ever after.  Or something like that.  Original Sin.  Tried hard to be steamy and suspenseful.  Enough so to keep our interest, maybe.  Angelina Jolie is quite a screen presence (speaking of wonderful boobs.  KD doesn't really show hers, does she?  If she does, I am SO there!)...  Antonio Banderas wasn't bad, and ultimately, the plot twists were interesting.  Not particularly great cinema, though.

      It's really good.  Kirsten Dunst looks better as a blonde, though.  Her boobs are very nice.  I thought Toby McGuire would suck.. He's actually not bad as Peter Parker.  Good casting on Harry and his dad (Willem Dafoe) -- they look so much alike, you'd think they were father and son in real life.  Willem Dafoe is great as The Green Goblin!  It made me laugh.  It make me cry.  And the effects are great!

       Actually, the page you linked was gone, so I (inquisitive mind and all) went to the top page.  Top and center was a monkey, um, orally pleasuring himself.  Farther down, a dog was humping a chicken.  Also lots of photos of "mommy parts", if you will.    Not quite a porn site, more a collection of weirdness, but definitely out there.  Got my 5-years-with-the-firm clock today (cool, actually), so even if they boot me out, I get to keep the clock.  Not quite as useful as a place to sleep, though.  Daf

      Wednesday night I went to Tita Josie's 60th Birthday.  Little did I know what they had in store for me.  I was forcibly volunteered as one of the line dancers in the beginning of the party.  Having only 30 minutes to practice didnt help at all.  Its a good thing it was a country line dance routine. Whew! simple steps really, two steps to the right then three steps to the left all a long facing my partner (not Dot), then twisting the partner around as we both walk three steps faced left. Then two steps to the left then two to the right.Parner moves to her left. I move to my left.  Go to the next partner.   then the cycle begins again.  I dont know the song but afterwards the DJ flipped the beat and switched over to NoDoubt's "Hella Good"!  At this point all the girls in the line dance converged together and did another number and WOW was it a number.  All that bumpin and grinding made it short of a lap dance.  Real Spicy!  The food I mean. The party was at  urlLink AKBARS  chique place in the CITY.  I must say Tita Josie throws lavish parties which I will miss.  Now shes about to retire and move home to the Philippines.  When asks where she will stay she mentioned to me that she might stay in AKLAN for a few months.  I never been there myself.  Its my Lolo Mike's home province.  Anyone been there?    More to come  (_)_) ~Net

      Yowzers!  A mini-cooper!  I havent seen that anywhere here in NY except in the magazine ads.  When I was growing up, my father always referred to it as a mini-ha-ha.  Dont know why he calls it that but thats how I remember the car.  I read somewhere that BMW re-released the car last year, but I for one havent seen the new series out on the L.I.E. (Long Island Expressway).  I wonder if it can still fit 4 comfortably.  That is.. one adult and 4 kids!  =)  Ha! Ha!    6 more days till the Vegas Vacation.  I cant wait.  Dot is bringing the Panasonic Cam she bought 2 weeks ago.  I for one am just glad that I can take off. The last two months have been brutal work wise.  Not a day that I start worrying about work.  One word... OVERLOAD!  The countdown begins.    Net

      No one can say that Dot isnt a smart shopper.  She went online last night and purchased Panasonic cam for 653 simoleons!  Best Buy had it for 899. Being that she saved 200 dollars Dot bought me a new car stereo for my birthday.

      Dot is shopping around for a digital video camera.  Over the week she went online and researched this Sony camera only to change her mind as soon as we got to BestBuy.  We perused BestBuy's circle of Digital Cams compared Sony with this Panasonic DV cam. I played around with the SonyCam smacked it up, flipped it, rubbed it down...then Dot calls me over to the other side of the circle.  Dot was playing with a Panasonic Brand. This particular model had similar functions as the SonyCam but it had something that Sony didnt.  SIZE!  Panasonic's mini size cam made Dot fall in love with it.  So much for all that research for Sony.  (Net makes motion of throwing out research papers on Sony Cam).  With that lets take a closer look at this Dot Cam before she buys it....      size not to scale   more to come...  ~Net

      I tinkered around with the nerd test radio buttons(the buttons you select to answer the questions) and what the test give you is an extra 50-100 points if you select yes to the Latin question and the digital watch question.  Not that I was trying to get the highest score.  It just came as a surprise to me that I would score higher than Bill Gates.  Going back to the questions and clicking on the NO radio buttons on the latter questions, I received a lower score.  IPOD is Apple's product for an MP3 player.  For all you music enthusiasts, there are 3 IPOD versions introduced in Macworld. Depending on the version that you purchase you can save up to 4000 songs on the IPOD which is about the size of your average Palm Pilot.  Now Apple will be letting the whole world in on the IPOD.  One will be able to use it for a Windows Computer and download MP3 compressed music to the IPOD.    QuarkXpress is what professional typesetters, magazine artists,etc use for creating documents.

      So, what would be the anthesis of the NERD test? Would it be the HIPSTER test? Is there such a thing? Net, you must be a super nerd cuz I have no clue what you are talking about: "QuarkXpress," "IPOD," etc. I feel like I need a lexicon. I feel like I'm in some weird alternate universe cuz really I believe the so-called "nerds" are really cool folk; I'm the one who feels like the super dork for not being in the loop about this stuff.

      I think this NERD test is biased.  Just because I was taught LATIN in grade school and I owned a digital watch with a calculator I got scored 100 points over the average.  My score is 520 points at a rating of 111.14%.  SUPER NERD.  I scored higher than Bill Gates.  Speaking of Nerds, I just came back from the Macworld convention.  Mac is now making an IPOD for Windows!  Whooohoo! Super MP3 players for my Win user friends!  I had the opportunity to be in the shadow of Steve Jobs as he made his rounds at the convention.  He even took a glimpse at my VIVA Las Vegas T-shirt with the scantily clothed VIVA girls.  OH my GOD  Steve Jobs likes my T-shirt.  The people from QuarkXpress was there and gave me a scaled version of their update to the professional page layout application.  Some freebies from Macworld magazine.(CDs/table coasters).  I cant believe MAC is releasing an upgrade to OS X and charging 200 smakaroons for a dot version upgrade.   More to come....  ~Net

      That Nerd Test was totally biased. It made it seem like techies and math and sciece whizzes are the only true nerds. I bet if they had questions regarding literature and my dorky literary habits my rating would increase exponentially.

      Out of curiousity I took the Nerd Test, I scored 419 and my rating is 89.72%.  I can't believe I lost a point for using a Windows machine.  I think the people who created the nerd quiz is not a big fan of Windows.  Anyhow, I don't think I'm nerdier than George Bush Sr. or Liberace.

      Now and then something interesting on the GoldenSushi page...I took the nerd test Score:459, Percentile 98.29%.  Should I be happy, or depressed about this.  I think it was the browsing at Radio Shack question that did me in.  Well, I do browse Radio Shack, and I've taken a couple dates to Barnes and Nobles too.  Man, I'm a dork.  To top it off, I just RSVP'd for the WebLoggers meet, (just because it was at The Pub.)

      Thanks for taking the Nerd test! Your score is:199    Your rating is: 42.61% That makes me just a bit nerdier than Britney Spears, not quite as nerdy as Richard Simmons. I lost a point logging in from a Windows machine - maybe I'll try again from our unix box (running Netscape on an HP 9000)  I should get a point just for thinking of that...

      Ching, I'm okay. Not to fret. Thanks for asking. I went to SF Pride Parade with gf Karen. We watched an outdoor concert at the Latino Stage. I had a chance to see the latina pop sensation Fey perform with very handsome dancers. We both got sunburned. Then Karen broke it off with me once she arrived back in southern Cal. Burned twice in the same summer. Bummer.    Okay, there's a photo and a bio of me at www.cinasphere.com. So can you now please leave me alone about wanting see my photo?j/k   The movies I saw this summer were Men In Black II, Spiderman, Star Wars Episode 2, and Minority Report. I thought it would be unlikely but I actually enjoyed watching Minority Report.I'm looking forward to watching Lilo & Stitch.   I'm still doing the Listen & Be Heard poetry series every Thursday. The L&BH crew is going to produce a live spoken word CD. I will be one of the features, and I'll be charge of marketing. The director of the Downtown Association performance stage requested I sign up for a slot for my poets. I already decided who will be the members of Vallejo Phoenix Rising performance poetry group. (Auditions took place last month.) I got word that I will be receiving the full amount for the grant I wrote for VPR.   My auntie just recently got married and she is no longer working as a staff person for my mother's carehome. Now my mother wants me to be a direct staff person. I feel hesitant, but I know my mother has connections that can give me possible leads for my therapeutic massage practice. (I lost my office space a while back when I broke off my independent contract partnership at a gym.)  And I sure can use the money.     I'm sorry I have not been bloggin in lately. I noticed a few new names. So, I just want to say a howdeeyadoo to Yasmin and Pia. And a longtimenohear to the rest of the gang.    This is Glee signing off... Keep on bloggin--

'm finishing the pre-requisites this coming fall and appying for the program in November. It sounds like you're working really hard in school so don't give up. Continue all your hard work and you'll get your BSN.  :)  So you saw my little cousin's pictures? Aren't they cute? Clarissa is almost 2 in December and she's so adorable and makulit. Her big sister Czarinna is turning 7 in December and she'll be in first grade this fall.  I taught her how to read. :)

       Daf at the movies   Undercover Brother :  Cross between "I'm Gonna Git You, Sucka" and "Austin Powers".  Not brilliant, but some REALLY funny/stupid moments.  Also some very derivative moments, particularly the golf course chase.  Don't know how well the parody plays for all you whippersnappers [g] too young to remember the 70s.  Star Wars II :  Didn't suck like SW1, not as good as the original.  Still, quite watchable.  Nice to see Yoda kick some ass, believable or not.  Lilo and Stitch :  VERY well done.  Nice character development, lots of real humor (as opposed to the Disney kind).  I knew right from the beginning, when Lilo punched out her classmate, that this would not be your typical Disney cartoon.  Aliens were excellent, too.  Scooby Doo :  Good job emulating the animated characters, especially Shaggy.  Treatment of Scrappy Doo was a riot.  Velma was very likeable.  Highlight: a fart contest scene worthy of  "Blazing Saddles".  Shaggy pot references were subtle, but definite.

       HIGHLANDER    Missed the monthly sales by about three grand!  Makes for a good lesson, start attacking goals from the beginning and do not try to play catch up in the end.  A new month is beginning. "Jaba" took a breather from his vacation to talk to the Territory Sales Representative that I hired.  He sat with Michael for a whole hour.  I was wondering if Jaba ate him.  When they both came out of the meeting room I was relieved.  Anyway, my boss likes the new recruit.  He expects me to train him on the capabilities of the store and its team members.  Funny, how he didnt even bleeped a sound about my "success".   Pia... if you look at the last 15 posts.  the movie titles we post at the beginning of each blog was Ching's idea.  Everytime someone posts at GS you have to think of a movie title that starts with the last letter of the title that the previous blogger poster.  IE.. i posterd Highlande(R).... so now the next GS post has to start with the letter R.  Any takers?    more to come....  NET

      Hi Pia - the deal with the game is that YOU get to pick what movie goes up next.  It just has to start with an "H". And I'm purposely talking about movies y'all might not have seen ('cos i'm old enough to be everybody's DAD here), that way we all broaden our horizons a little.  I never saw Strange Days or Nell or Dogma or Armageddon either... And talk about feeling out of place - 25 years older than all y'all, and don't know word one of Tagalog...  but I stick around 'cos you're all nice to me.  ;-)

      I'm still here guys! I read our blog everyday. It's just that school is really hectic and I hardly have any time to stay long enough online to blog.  Besides, I have never seen any of the movies you guys talk about.  I feel so out of place. :(

       LOVE AND DEATH    A Woody Allen send-up of every Russian novel ever written.  Cute in a sort of a  "look at us aren't we devilishly clever"  way.  Not his best work.  Maybe his last Diane Keaton movie - I disremember.  We're all on the edge of our chairs, Net - didja make it?  Still on your way to Emperor?   And... ...is this just a 3-corner game?  Or can we get Pia and Jen and Glee and aPriL et al to join in?

       NELL   Just got done watching "Strange Days" --- never seen it before.. Saw it on TV while channel-surfing.  Totally intriguing.. I ask Brian what it's all about as I usually do with movies because I know he's seem them all.  Annoyed, he dismisses my question and tells me that I have to watch it from the beginning in order for it to make sense.  And he goes, "I've got it here somewhere -- if you haven't sold it yet.."  So I watch it in the bedroom while I'm ironing.  Pretty good.  Makes you think.  Didn't James Cameron do "Titanic"?  How can the same guy make "Strange Days" and then turn around and make a movie like "Titanic"?  It doesn't add up!  Then again, a dollar's a dollar..  Brian's just relieved that I have something else to do other than pester him to get off the computer so I can take my turn.  Needless to say, the movies over and I bumped him off the computer.  Shoot, he was just playing Star Trek Armada II, anyway!  It's not like he's writing a manifesto.  Which, if he were, I'd be really worried.  The last thing I need is to be married to a Ted Kazinski wannabe.  What is the deal with those strategy games anyway?  Am I the only one who doesn't get it?  They're all freaking the same!!  Speaking of games, we ran to Best Buy last night at 8:45 PM -- 15 minutes before closing time thinking that we'd buy Tekken 4.. It doesn't even come out until September 25!! Some wacko worker at Best Buy told Brian that it was coming yesterday!  They should give us something for wasting our freaking time!  I need some compensation, dammit!!

       ARMAGGEDON     Its coming down to the wire.  I opened up the sales report for August and my store needs 3500 simoleons to make the sales plan.  My highspeed color printer is down.  Xerox says they cant get a technician to me until after 5pm.  Meanwhile, I have a project thats on hold which can put me over the top if I can get it printed ($10,000).  It still needs to get laminated and 3 hole drilled.  If Xerox can fix my printer and get the document printed, I can send it to my outsource to complete the auxilliary work and I can complete a banner month at  urlLink Kinko's  - sans my boss who is still on vacation.  What proof do I need, to show the powers that be, that I deserve my own empire?     Did I mention its raining cats and dogs out here?  Daf - I never seen Fisher King.  Looks like I have another thing to list on  urlLink Netflix  as my next DVD to borrow.  Ching - I read that link about cyberwings.  First time I'm hearing of that site.  So sorry that you have been a victim.  We are all victims of this Shaun's devilish scheme.  Anyway, the weatherman is saying that there might be flash floods for the evening commute tonight.  I might be coming home on a boat.   more to come... NET

       YEAR OF THE DRAGON   This afternoon could not get any worse. I went to pick up Dorothy from work and I was 10 minutes late. She reiterated that I should be prompt and that weve been through this once before.   I ended up angry and decided to pop the accelerator and overtake the slow moving car in front of me. Dorothy shut up and was shocked at what I did. When I calmed down she politely said "Can you try to drive normally, I would like to live long and have kids."    Neither of us apologized for the way we reacted to each other this afternoon. We did went on with our evening. I went rollerblading with her by Bayside Marina and later watched Oceans 11. I ended the evening giving her a goodnight kiss and she having a smile on her face.   (N) is next.

       DEAD POETS SOCIETY      Let's play our movie game..  Brian and I used to play this on our cellphones when we're going convoy to make the time pass by quicker.  The rules are simple: you can't repeat movie titles and your title should begin with the last letter / number of the previous movie named.  In this case, the next person to blog needs to head their blog entry with a movie that starts with a "Y" --- clear as mud?  Let's play!

      Welcome back Ching & Brian!   Net, it's gotta be tough to be a shock jock - there are lines you can't cross, but it's your job to go right up to them without crossing over.  Hard to do consistently.  You couldn't pay me enough!   There was that movie with Robin Williams and one of the Bridges boys - forget the title (I own the VHS and still can't remember - sad or what?)...  Speaking of shock-jock bits gone seriously wrong.

For this event they want to sell some of the GREAT  urlLink gadgets  they had in the old studio.   urlLink CLICK HERE  to see the goodies they are selling.  In other news, this week, my beloved boss took is long awaited two week vacation.  And not a moment too soon!  The end of week one is here and I have improved the store greatly!  We've aquired the highest customer service rating in the region.  90.6% of those surveyed says we ROCK!  Mystery Shopper anyone?  We scored a perfect 100!  Who's you're daddy?  Whats left is to clean the house!  The powers that be are visiting the New York market, My boss "JaBa" and I will have to make sure the store is up to their standards.  I have to start by sweeping the mice away.  Got a couple of them who still arent playing my way.  But enough of myself.  This is a forum.    Change of topics....   urlLink WNEW  fired  urlLink OPIE and ANTHONY .  The two shock DJ's were fired for the dare they gave their listners to have Sex in St. Patricks Cathedral!

      Talked to a few people about Cyberwings but getting mixed opinions.  Some say to wait it out when they regroup and up and running by the end of August and some say to take the money and run with another server.  This is the first I have heard of a server going down for such a long period without major notification and no direct re-startup date.  It sounds very fishy.  Speaking of fish, I think its time to dip the pole in the Long Island Sound.  A couple of co-workers and I will fish after work.  Hmmm. I might have to borrow Tonino's fish rods. Mine is MIA.  I dont remember taking it with me when I left Manhattan.      More to come...  NET

      Back in Las Vegas sans Dottie.  Im here for the  urlLink DEF CON X  convention.  For those of you out of the loop its a "Nerd" convention filled with would-be-hackers, network gurus, and of course nerds like me.  This is my first DC, I am so anxious.  I ran into Pat Norton from TechTV at the Hard Rock Hotel playing Black Jack.  I played a couple of hands on his table but lost.  (not much of a gambler).  This is also the first for me that my manager agreed that I can charge the flight costs to the company. Woohoo!!! I am so appreciative of it since I got to fly first class thanks for the upgrade from my JFK connections.  Flight was kinda bumpy but it was great to be in "friendly" skies. Las Vegas is soooooo HOT.  Okay, gettin ready to dip in the pool I am putting on some sun block...for those of you that tan easily I recommend SPF45 or higher. Who is the server for our site?  I might be able to find some answeres here at DC.   more to come  ~NET

      Heres a story I received in E-mail.  I found it ironic.  Its probably made its round trip in email fwds. Anyway, read on:    A city boy, Kenny, moved to the country and bought a donkey from an old   farmer for $100.00. The farmer agreed to deliver the donkey the next day    The next day the farmer drove up and said, "Sorry son, but I have some   bad news, the donkey died."   Kenny replied, "Well then, just give me my money back."    The farmer said, "Can't do that. I went and spent it already."    Kenny said, "OK then, just unload the donkey."    the farmer asked, "What ya gonna do with him?" Kenny said, "I'm going to raffle him off."   Farmer, "You can't raffle off a dead donkey!"    Kenny, "Sure I can.  Watch me. I just won't tell anybody he is dead."    A month later the farmer met up with Kenny and asked, "What happened  with that dead donkey?"    Kenny, "I raffled him off. I sold 500 tickets at two dollars a piece and made a profit of $898.00."    Farmer, "Didn't anyone complain?"    Kenny, "Just the guy who won. So I gave him his two dollars back."    Kenny grew up and eventually became the chairman of Enron.     More to come...  ~NET

       KING PIN   Has this been used yet?  Anyway sorry I've been out of commish for a while.. As I have mentioned before, the computer went kaput.. Brian had to order another harddrive from DELL.. In the meantime, I've decided to buy my own computer.  It's neato!!  It's 2.53 Ghz Pentium IV with a DVD/CD player on the first bay & DVD/CD burner on the second bay.  I decided to forgo the internal zip drive because Brian's computer has one and I really wouldn't need it except to access some of the old stuff that I have saved which is no biggie because our computers are networked together!  It's awesome!  I think I'll be online more from now on.  Look for me on AIM, YM & ICQ!  And, of course, here!  By the way, just got done watching Sweet Home Alabama.. It's soo good!

       New York, New York  A very unpopular movie that gave us a very popular song.  Liza Minelli and De Niro, I think (?) - way too long since I saw it.  Anyhow, I liked it.  I'm back from Washington state.  It was a great visit, I found out a whole lot of family history, spent time with my (semi-estranged) brother and my (semi-estranged) son and his family.  Went well, mostly.  We all survived, at least.  Great to see my stepmom again, got a little hiking in - and LOTS of eating!  Heard an interview with the author of "The Gospel According to Tony Soprano", or something like that.  Talks about all the parallels to the book of Ecclesiastes, which is about a man who finds riches, wisdom, and pleasure - and is still unhappy.  I'll never view the Sopranos the same way.  Saw "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" last week.  What a blast!  Kim loved it too.  I tried to get her to see it when it came out, she hadn't heard of it, so wasn't interested (We saw "Undercover Brother" instead).  So Daf got a big "I told you so" score outta that one!

The Sopranos' second episode premieres tonight.  So far Toni Soprano has a new scheme up his sleeve-Hotels.  Moving right along, Toni got an idea in his head to hide is Simoleons in his back yard.  He put some in the tool shed, some in bags of nuts, etc. Cant wait for the next show.  Gotta go for now.  Its about to start.   More to come....  NET

       STOP MAKING SENSE   Talking Heads team up with a few of the guys from Funkadelic and Jonathon Demme to make one of the most watchable, listenable, danceable concert films of all time.  Special bonus:  Tom-Tom Club (led by Talking Heads bassist Tina Weymouth) doing "My Boyfriend", currently being revived in (Honda, I think?) commercials.  But, of course, singer/ songwriter/ leader David Byrne is the major presence in this video.  If you've never seen it, GO GET IT!  Thanks to Ching for sharing her wedding pix.  Did she look happy or what?  Hey Net, tell the hopelessly Anglo among us (that would be me) what the tea ceremony is!  It's a Chinese thing, right?

       Young Hercules    The new season of the Sopranos premiered on HBO tonight.  Life is back to normal in the Net household.  Had a great time at Em and Werner's wedding.  Who wouldnt have a great time?  A ten course Chinese dinner;  My brother-in-law as the DJ; All of Dot's friends from UB* and of course Open Bar!  The open bar made the headlines.  Our friend Dave (Nappy) went to the dancefloor with a drink in hand and spilled half of it on Dot's dress.  Thank goodness for club soda and a blow dryer.  Em changed dresses 4 times last night from wedding gown to traditional chinese to 2 night gowns.  Man, this is where Cher got the idea for her concerts.  No drinks on Ems clothes though.  After Dot's incident, Billy (brother-in-law) announced through the PA that there will be no more drinking on the dancefloor.  The tea ceremony was  a tear jerker.  Emily had tears in her eyes when she received the traditional red envelope from her mother.  Was it the amount?  Only Em and Werner know.  Going off for now, The Sopranos are showing again on HBO2.    More to come NET

I also wanted to show my mom what a great job you and Tito Rico did on your basement.  Anyhow, hope things are going well with you.  If you have time, please come and visit me here in Frisco with Ching and Brian!   Hey Daf, I love all those Doris Day and Rock Hudson movies!  I used to watch them a lot with my grandma.

       SEND ME NO FLOWERS   Doris Day, Rock Hudson, Tony Randall.  'Twas a simpler time, everyone kept their clothes on, no one had skeletons in the closet (poor Rock), girls just dreamed of marriage, which equaled life happily ever after.  Kim LOVES these movies.  I find them wholly irrelevant, but I DO love Kim, so watch them we do...  My vacation starts today - two weeks off!  Yippee!  I'm flying out to Washington State, will meet up with my brother Matt, we'll be visting our stepmom, Dorothy, and help settle Dad's estate.  He died last year, and, we imagine, left everything to Dorothy, but she had mementos, clothes, and the like to pass along.  She lives on the Olympic Peninsula, which is my favorite place in the whole world - mountains, rivers, lakes, rain forests, and the ocean all within an hour - rarely colder than 40 or hotter than 80, and, though most of the peninsula is rainy, she's in a town, Sequim, that only gets 18 inches annual rainfall - they even have to irrigate the farms.  I'll also be meeting up with my son Andy, his new bride Sarah, and their son Wesley.  I bought their tickets (don't believe the ads -  urlLink Travelocity  came up way cheaper than  urlLink Hotwire ).  Ching knows a bit of the  urlLink Andy story  - anyhow, we're trying to put the past behind us and be a family.  We had dinner this past Monday, and I finally got to meet Wesley, first time since he came home from the hospital over two years ago.  Dinner went well, we're all hoping things keep going smoothly.  The Washington trip is only 5 days - the rest's going to be around Michigan - I still have class, but maybe Kim and I can get away for a few days.  That would be nice.  Oh, and Net - you have to go back and fix your recycle - has to start with Y and end with S.  I imagine this game will get a lot harder down the road when we've used up a bunch of the movies we all know.

       Nightmare on Elmstreet 5: The Dream Child   Okay guys, I still love urlLink George A. Romero   even though I had to change the movie I poster since it was a recycle.  Man I have to keep up with this blog set.  Anyhoot, horror movie genres takes me back being a teen in  urlLink NEWTOWN  High School.  As I was chatting to Ching about it, I mentioned that I am a big fan of horror flicks.  When I was a teenager,  I took a class on movie making and made an attempt at making a horror flick for my final.  It ended up being a comedic spoof according to the reviews of my peers!  My teacher offered me a free class in movie making course had I applied to St. Johns University.  Sad to say, I lost the reels during my move back to Queens.  Speaking of nightmares, if any of you use Windows XP there is a service  urlLink pack  that has been released.  It fixes a major problem in the directories that will prevent a hacker from deleting important files on your system directory.   urlLink LEOVILLE , has intructions on it.  Let your friends know about it.  Some of you might have trouble downloading the service pack since it is larger than 2 Mb.  LEOVILLE has  a quick fix but remember this only affects users that have upgraded to XP.  If you have Win 98 or Windows ME you are still safe.  more to come. NET

       Sleepless in Seattle    Reality Bites  is one of my favorite movies! I love Wynona Rider (before her whole stealing scandal)  and I also love the soundtrack. Anyhow Ching, you've got a new cat?! How cute! You need to take a photo and send it to me! I wanna see :) BTW, nice hair cut.  I can't believe you chopped off all your hair! It was super long already.

       REALITY BITES   Traditionally, the groom's parents pay for the tuxes.. But if both the bride and groom are financially independent and are not anticipating any assistance from their parents then the groom takes care of the tux bill.  Or the bride and groom together.. But this is 2002.  I guess the person who can afford it pays.

       urlLink  LIAR LIAR    Drove down to Brooklyn yesterday.  Aside from being home of the Dodgers before they moved to Los Angeles.  It is also home for Em and Werner. Dot's friends since she was a freshman at U.B.*  Anyway, we picked them up and all of us drove to New Jersey to make adjustments to Em's wedding dress at  urlLink MarryMeWedding Wedding Palace .  Em tried the extravagant gown which needed some hemming.  We took video shoots of it and Werner promises to convert it to digital format for internet viewing.  Hope to upload it to my briefcase soon.  Anyhoot, the trip came without controversy.  Em caught me and Werner talking about his bachelor romps and she overheard him talking to me about having his groomsmen only paying for half of their tux rentals.  According to Werner, he had the groomsmen try on the tuxes three weeks ago.  Werner also added that in his whims of the vernacular, he offered to pay for half of the cost of the men's rentals - unbeknownst to Em who overheard us talking about this.   Now that the secret is out Em needed a word with Werner.  Apparently, Em and Werner's budget did not inclued the cost of the tuxedo rentals which is normally paid for by each groomsman.  ~sigh.  In the mean time, I snuck out of the gown area at MMW and into the alcove where Dot walk to once she heard the commotion between Em and Werner.  Dot jokingly asked me if Werner was going to pay for her gown too since she was the Maid of Honor.  I shrugged my shoulders in response.    I was  glad that the confrontation did not turn ugly.  Em and Werner made up and now the question comes to mind.  How are the groomsmen going to pay for their tuxes?  Oh did I mention that MarryMe Wedding Palace is owned by Dorothy's Aunt?   More to come....  NET

       YOU'VE GOT MAIL   Watched  Queen of the Damned  yesterday.. Not as bad a everyone said it was.  Not as good as I expected it to be either.  Spent the day hanging out with Jen.  But first, Brian and I took our two cats to the vet.. Oh, yeah!  I haven't told you guys yet.  Brian finally broke down and got me a kitten!  It's all black & super-cute!  His name is Felix.  We took Felix and Hobbie to the vet yesterday..  Then Brian went off to work and I stayed home with the full intention of veggin' out.  Jen calls me up to have lunch with her so I find myself getting up to go to Applebee's.  I buy lunch to bring to Brian for a mid-afternoon snack.  After lunch, Jen and I go to Planet Hair for my much-needed haircut.  My waist-length hair has been reduced to above the shoulders.. It's a modified bob.. Very much like the hairstyle that I had when I was a senior in high school.  Brings back memories..   Anyhow, we go shopping at the mall.  I took Jen to A&F and to Hollister Co. next door..  Redeemed my Express coupon.. Got some Orange Julius, etc.  After that we came back home to try on our finds.  Jen wanted to watch  Legally Blonde  one of my all-time favorite movies (I love Reese Witherspoon -- I can't wait until  Sweet Home Alabama  is released!).  We load it on the DVD and watch.. We wait for Brian to get home from work.  Dinner was at mom and dad's: porkchops & leftover sinigang.  Yum!  Did some karaoke on the "magic mic."  Watched the US Open women's finals..   This morning we had brunch with Brian's family at Legends.. Good food!  It's his mom's birthday tomorrow..  Anyway, we're going to go see  Swim Fan  later tonight with Kevin and Stephanie.  That should be good.  On Wednesday we get our Road Runner -- yippee!!  I'm so excited I don't think I'll be able to sleep for the next three days!

       ROCKY   The movie that started it all.  I never got it - Stallone's lame, Talia Shire's worse.  Some good scenes - especially the meat locker scene - and Burgess Meredith is good as a caricature of a grizzled old trainer, but really left me cold.  Sequels were even worse.  Thanks for the encouragement, Net.  My Tuesdays and Wednesdays are shot for the next 3-4 months!  I roll home 12 or 1am.  I'm really dragging butt this morning!  I agree, GREEN MILE was excellent!  Very powerful visuals.  I kinda saw the "Jesus" character as more a force of nature (I think Hanks even used that line) than as Christ-like, but sometimes I'm too literal in my interpretations.

       TWISTER   I appaud you Daf!  I want to go back and get my graduate degree too!  =(  Cant find any time right now though.  My sister is a teacher in the NYC Public School System.  She got her graduate in Teaching. Fordam University offered her a fellowship after she graduated from Queens College.  I can say I am proud of both of you and a little envious.  Good luck to you and study well.   In other news, they are preparing a lot of activities for 911.  Gosh, it is hard to believe it has been almost a year since the attack at the Twin Towers.  Sigh, I still think it just happened yesterday.  The Port Authority of NY/NJ is still up in the air about what to do with the WTC site.  Should they erect new buildings over the sacred ground that seems to be a burial setting now for hundreds of people?  In my opinion, they should forget about building there and just put up a park and a monument.  I would rather see new buildings go up around the area than inside the WTC site.   This weekend, after refraining from betting on the Lottery, I bought my first MEGA Millions Lottery ($1).  Results?  I lost of course. Ching, you can be rest assured that I will donate some of the proceeds to GoldenSushi if I hit it. In other stories, I watched the GREEN MILE tonight with Dot. I had no idea that it was derived from a Stephen King novel!  Big surprise for me.  Of course once I found out I began noticing the usual corelation to King's other stories.  I am talking about the Jesus Christ/God like theory where King justifies one of the characters as Jesus-like and has the power that overwhelms the other characters.  Another corelation is the event of a "miracle" occuring in the story.  Here it happens a few times.  A very well done movie.  Go rent it on  urlLink NETFLIX .    And Finally, for those of you who are jewish, I would like to remind you that this Friday Sept.6 is the eve of   urlLink Rosh Hashannah .  Please go to temple...   More to come....  NET

      Wow!  I've gotta work on my timing!  I'm changing mine to:   SUPERMAN   Very well-done, light-hearted treatment of the Man o'  Steel.  Later sequels got stupid.  Sad to see how things turned out for Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder, though.  My favorite bit - when S'man tells Lois what color her panties are.

       YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN   One of the funniest movies ever made, and one of Mel Brooks' three best (along with THE PRODUCERS and BLAZING SADDLES).   Blucher!!!   Thanks for the kind words, you guys.  Had Chorale and Organ last night - this is gonna be hard.  Pia:  Check out the book for Never Ending Story - excellent, especially for a translation (from German?  I think...).  I read it to my kids before the movie came out.  One of the best book concepts ever!  Ching:  urlLink IMDB  has a  urlLink joint ventures  feature:  Joint Ventures Here are the titles which credit the individuals Minnie Driver (Actress) ,  John Cusack (Actor)   Grosse Pointe Blank (1997)  7.4/10 (13530 votes)    Or was that cheating?

       Never Ending Story    I know this is a super old movie, but I thought I'd mention it because it was my favorite when I was five.  I still watch it whenever they show it on Disney Channel. :)  Anyhow,  I haven't seen  XXX  either.  I heard it was pretty good.  Jeff saw it with Joey while I was in Kansas for Ching's wedding.  I don't like to go to the movies by myself so I guess I will just wait for it to come out on DVD.  Ching, did you call me today? Sorry I missed your call. I was probably in class already when you called.  Speaking of class, good luck with school Daf.  :)  I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  :)  Net, sorry to hear about your tires.  Hope you'll find a cheaper place to do your car's 90,000 mile tune-up.

I guess we'll take  After the Fox . ;-)  Have you all seen  XXX  yet?  Brian has.. He saw it the night before our wedding.  I haven't, though.. Perhaps we'll rent it when it comes out on DVD rentals.   High Fidelity  was really good.  We saw it when it came out in theaters.  Thought it was hilarious!  Brian loves Jack Black!  I love John Cusack.  He has another really good movie with Minnie Driver in it.. Here's a trivia quiz for you.. Can anyone name it?    Daf, so glad to hear that you're going back to school..

       xXx   I don't know if that's the real spelling - that's how the local drive-in had it before they closed Labor Day.  Anyhow, haven't seen it, want to, but Kim doesn't.  I'm flying solo this weekend - Kim, Jess and baby are going to Virginia for a baby shower - may be a good time to take in a flick.  I thought Vin Diesel was great in "The Fast and the Furious".  Here's what I really wanted to post about today - Jay goes back to school!  Starting at  urlLink Madonna University  in lovely  urlLink Livonia, MI  - more white people per capita than any other 100,000+ city in the country.  I used to work there, 15 years ago.  Apparently still what it always was...  My degree will be in Church Music, may try to work it into a teaching certificate too.  I have a 1982 BA in Economics from  urlLink Wayne State University  (a FAR more diverse place), so school this time will just be about fulfilling the major requirements.  Wish me luck - I'll need it!

       EAST OF EDEN   Made somebody's (FHM's?) list of all-time worst movies recently.  Gotta agree - the unsexiest movie about sex ever.  Rosie, put something on!  Please!  But I really want to talk about:   PICNIC, MEDICINE MAN, HIGH FIDELITY,  and  PECKER ...  PICNIC is a 1955 movie with William Holden and Kim Novak.  Kim (Ricketts, not Novak) and I were watching the tube the other night, this came on, and she got all hyped -  Ooh!  Ooh!  I know this movie!  - turns out she had never seen it, but her musical-loving bachelor brother with the string of male roommates (draw your own conclusions - his Mom's still in denial.  We love him regardless.) had the soundtrack LP and used to play it all the time.  She had big chunks of the dialogue memorized.  Kind of a soapy movie, intense emotions, a bit overblown.  Bad apple from the wrong side of the tracks wins the heart of the small town festival queen.  I had never even heard of it, much less seen it, but my IMDB research showed somebody (Novak, maybe?) got an Oscar.  Also had "Spiderman"'s dad, Charlie's grandpa from "Willy Wonka", Mother Superior from "The Trouble with Angels", and the lady who did the voice for the aunt with the cats in "Lady and the Tramp".  MEDICINE MAN was from the same tubefest - we get some Ontario stations on clear nights, and some real interesting fare - including the Sopranos (uncut).  Anyhow, this was a movie neither of us had ever heard of, but we watched.  Sean Connery and Lorraine Bracco (speaking of the Sopranos - she's the shrink), 1992.  He's a cancer field researcher assigned to the Amazon, she's the corporate shill who's sent to check up on him, and then chemistry takes over.  VERY wll played, though Kim and I both figured out the "secret" way before the scientists did.  Excellent interplay between Connery and Bracco, though.  Kim's hunting down the DVD - we missed the beginning.  HIGH FIDELITY was a DVD we borrowed from my niece.  Music geeks in love, or something like that.  Cusack is great, sort of a regular guy with (a) a passion for record collecting, and (b) a psychotic approach to dating.  While a realtime breakup unfolds, he takes us back to his history of failed romances, looks up the girls to find out if he's the problem, and we bounce in and out of flashbacks while his girlf tumbles into a relationship with a graytail (Timothy Robbins), and he hooks up with Lisa Bonet (mmmm!).  The best part of this whole thing though, is the record store, where his goofy sidekicks steal the show.  Jack Black absolutely should have gotten a Best Supporting Actor out of this.  The outtakes (I love DVDs!) had some cool moments, too.  PECKER is a John Waters flick about a kid with a camera, also from my niece's collection.  We watched 40 minutes and lost interest.  Waters has this kind of cartoonish approach with his characters that wears real thin after a while.  Too bad - I love Christina Ricci, but just couldn't watch any more.

       EVITA   Went to the Sunoco garage this morning to get my tire fixed.  It took in all about 15 minutes.  The guy too the tire off my car then pulled the screw off and placed a red piece of rubber and poked it in the tire.  Bang! Zoom! "That will be 10 dollars please" they garage owner says.  I looked at my odometer to note the mileage on my car.  89890!  Man, I am gonna need a tune up soon.  At 90,000 miles I have to get Samantha a new timing belt and other mileage adjustments.  I drove to the local  urlLink Great Bear  for an estimate.  $495.00 for a 90,000 mile tuneup.  Gulp!  More to come... Net

       TERMINATOR   Driving home from Dot's Aunt in Long Island I got a screw stuck in my tire.  I wondered why my driving felt different.  At first I though it was a pebble stuck on one of the tires but then everytime I hit a bump. The feel of the drive felt like something wasnt right.  As I was driving around the block from my apartment, The right tire sounded like it was flat.  I pulled over and looked, but it wasnt flat.  After I parked my poor Samantha, I looked more closely at the tire in question.  As I suspected there was something wrong.  Stupid Screw!  Now I have to go to the service station in the morning to get the thing taken out and have the tire plugged.  ~Sigh   more to come... NET

       LAST OF THE RED HOT LOVERS   James Coco.  Straight from Broadway.  Never saw it.  Hey, Net - the correct title is "Who Framed Roger Rabbit".  I think you need to find another R___T movie...  Spooky story about the White Lady.  My son Andy, when he was two or three, saw "blue ghosts" in our old house in Detroit.  They didn't scare him, and they were around all the time.  We did some research, and found out the first owner died there.  His wife sold it and moved out, but may have died by the time Andy said he saw them (she sold in '79, we bought in '83, Andy turned 2 in '86).  He tried to point out the ghosts to Kim, but she couldn't see them.  We sold the house in '87.

       YENTL    In my boyscouting days,  Angelicum School let us conduct our camping at the soccer field.  Then rumor started spreading amongs the troops that the field and the whole school used to be a cemetary and that the elementary building was believed to be haunted by a "White Lady".  Some of us decided to investigate this phenomena so that evening we crawled out of our tents taking care that non of the ScoutMasters saw us and sneaked up to the third floor of the Elementary building.  We shined our flashlights to get our bearings.  It was a full moon that night so we could see shadows.  Then all of a sudden it got really cold.  All ten of us felt it. I looked at my friend in the eye and as I turned back towards my peers we all saw the "White Lady" floating and moving away from us.  We all screamed and ran down the stairs and back to our camp site.  Obviously, we awakened the ScoutMasters and they were not happy about the situation.  For punishment, we were told to squat in a line up for a half hour.  It made my legs cramp up but it was better that being with the white lady.  We never fessed up about what we saw but for me it felt real.   More to come... NET

       I AM TRYING TO BREAK YOUR HEART   Excellent documentary about the band Wilco.  I, of course, identified with the keyboard player, not just 'cos he played keys (like me), but also his name was Jay (like me) and he talked too much (like me).  Then they fired him midway through the movie.  I've been thrown out of a lot of bands, too.  Great movie, though - check it out if you get a chance.  Great band, too - I've got their latest CD, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, on heavy rotation.  Thx to Ching & Brian for the Hallowe'en pics - we couldn't get a sitter for Grandma and had to skip the one we were invited to, so we lived vicariously through yours...

        YOU'VE GOT MAIL   -  he  he guess this one's a no brainer.   Advance HAPPY BIRTHDAY  to Ching!!!!  We are planning a custume party -so I guess anyone can be who ever they want to be.  I have been pre advised Ching's gonna be a cat, Jenni working on a cleopatra custume as for me I will have my zebra woman outfit (courtesy of Walmart).   I was catching up on my sex on the city ( I have the DVD versions of it),  I watch it for the fashion side, considering these ladies live in New York.  Not just that they live in New York but that they can afford to be fashionable.      But all these girls can use a Dr. Phil (of the Oprah fame).  They ask so many questions - I swear even I could give it straight to them.  Like this Carrie character, who goes out with a Mr. Big, everything good from her point of view but all you have to do is turn it the other way because if you look at this from his vantage point, he is not even interested in introducing her to his mother, after 2 years   of going out.  Fast forward and he ends up marrying a very pretty tall woman he met in Paris (young 25) because take note these ladies from New are 30 something. They think they are so smart (I say naive).  Fast forward some more (7 months after his marriage) he calls her, (drunk) says he is not happy, bumps into her (by accident) says leaving his wife (drunk??) and she tortures herself, finds herself in bed with him again.   Tells him "we should not be doing this", he asks why???  girl unable to answer. I answered for her. Because it makes her feel like shit!!!! On the other hand, as Mr  Big the answer would be  -but it makes me feel good and powerful.   And why would you Miss Carrie make a Mr Big feel that way when you have equal power to find a man who can make you feel as a woman good and powerful yourself...  Yada, yada yada   Thanks to my husband Ric for giving me the DVD"s  (first, second and third season).  I enjoy them immensely.....

       SLEEPING BEAUTY   Classic Disney - gorgeous heroes and heroines, scary ugly evil villains.  Every home should have this one.  Her stories were great, Pia - that was how I met her.  That and the rolling group novel (I stayed outta that one - way over my prosaic head).  Still writing, Ching?

       GHOSTBUSTERS   I know what you mean Daf.  Ching is such a talented webpage designer as well as a terrific writer.  She used to have an old webpage where she posted a couple of her writings.  She's awesome.  Ching I thought I'd give you some props!  :) BTW, it was nice chatting with you and Eli last night.  Whatever happened to chatting with Brian?  I wasn't able to see any of the messages he posted.

       EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX, BUT WERE AFRAID TO ASK   Wildly funny Woody Allen movie  (remember when he made funny movies?  It's been a very long time...)  based on the popular factoid book of the 60's.  Best scenes: Tony Randall as a sperm, and Gene Wilder as a lover of sheep.  I went to a Hallowe'en party once, dressed as his character (after the fall) - a bum with a bottle of Woolite.  checked out Ching's  urlLink new site  - really nice.  WTG, Ching!  I hope, someday, I'm artistic and web-literate enough to do that.

Don't know if I can transfer BBSM (that sounds bad, doesn't it?) or not, but I don't do anything fancy with that one anyhow.  Anyhow, I haven't read up on the multiple blog thing yet.  Should have time today - there is NOTHING happening at work.

       EATING RAOUL  Low budget, gross, but funny as hell.  Even Kim, perpetually squeamish, thought this one was funny.  I just upgraded to blogspot plus - wanna see if I can crosspost images, so here's one of:   Kim!!!  It's our 24th anniversary today.  Please go down the page and reread the song I wrote for her last week.  It's as close as I can get with words.  She is my whole world.

       SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER   High psychodrama with Liz, Katherine, and Monty (I think) - and the absolute squirmiest subject matter imaginable.  Ecch.  Very well done, though, and daring for its time (late 50's?).  Still, ecch.  The outpouring of support for Andy and Sarah was really moving - we probably got 20 or 25 notes from friends on the internet.  That sense of community is maybe the best thing about the 'net.  Speaking of the 'net, looks like Garry Trudeau's set his sights on Bloggers this week:     I'm sure he doesn't mean US.  [g]

       TOM JONES   One of the sexiest movies of all time.  Especially the oyster scene...  Here's a song for Kim:   It's our 24th anniversary coming up - this one gets a little bit, um, descriptive, but it's from the heart.  And there aren't enough songs out there about married love (though OUR song is Wynonna's "She Is His Only Need", fat chance this'll replace THAT one).   Beautiful Still   1) Her warm wide smile, left lines where there were none, But still gets me undone, like watching the sun or the wind. And she won't sing for me, but she sings for her babies, Sings of Christmas, and fairies, of cherries, and sin.  And she is beautiful still She unlocks my secret places, Makes me cross and cry and crazy, Then heals me with her graces. She is beautiful, Still: She raises up my valleys, She levels my hills. She is beautiful still. She is beautiful. Still.  2) Her breasts, soft like peaches, with cotton candy gumdrop nipples, Jump at the touch of my finger, the wet of my tongue. Her alabaster belly, stretched by my children, And the treasure it neighbors, they are calling me down.  And she is beautiful still She unlocks my secret places, Makes me whole and hot and hazy, Then heals me with her graces. She is beautiful, Still: She raises up my valleys, She levels my hills. She is beautiful still. She is beautiful. Still.   3) Her emerald eyes sparkle, and flash, and brim over With tears for her children, her mother, tears for her losses, Her back, wracked by accidents, still lovely and freckled, She smiles through the wreckage, no matter the cost.  And she is beautiful still She unlocks my secret places, Makes me warm and weird and weary, Then heals me with her graces. She is beautiful, Still: She raises up my valleys, She levels my hills. She is beautiful still. She is beautiful. Still.  4) And when we have been there for twoscore and ten years Her side by my side, through lean years and feast years, and more, Our time-ravaged bodies will still stand together, Through whatever, whenever, we'll weather every storm.  And she'll be beautiful still Unlock my secret places, Make me fear and fierce and foolish, Then heal me with her graces. She will be beautiful, Still: She will raise up my valleys, She'll level my hills. She will be beautiful still. She'll be beautiful. Still.  copyright Jay Ricketts, 2002.

       DRAGNET   Kinda funny, kinda stupid.  Dan Aykroyd does his dead-on Jack Webb impression throughout, but it's kind of incongruous with his looks.  Tom Hanks was still in his  Bosom Buddies  persona back then - wacky-irreverent-mr-nice-guy, just like in  Splash ,  Bachelor Party ,  Big ... can't remember exactly when he grew out of that.  Glad he did, though.  So where's April?  Glee?  Jen?  This is kinda fun with 5 of us, but 8 would be so much better!

       WESTWORLD  Went to a wedding this weekend.  It's the wedding of Dorothy's cousin Kim Yan.  He married Sheldeen Yambao.  Yes, its a Chinese-Filipino wedding.  They had a full mass at this church in Lindenhurst, NY.  A quaint small town in the south shore of Long Island.  Dot put me in charge of taping with her video cam.  I also played a role in church by doing the second reading.  Sheldeen arrived 20 minutes late and the wedding party walked up the aisle kind of fast.  The funny parts I think happened when they placed Sheldeen's train on top of the chair.  It looked like someone was under her train.  Luckily, one of the bridesmaids noticed and fixed it.  Right around the offertory service, the Video guy tripped on one of the flowers.  That was a laugh riot but unfortunate for me I didnt have my video cam on.  Dot asked me: "Did you get that?".  I acted like Homer and said: "Doh!"   The reception was held at Chatteau La Mer.  Its a catering hall at docks in Babylon,NY.  It overlooks the bay right before Jones beach.  It has a breath taking view, thank goodness the sun decided to show after the Church ceremony.  Kim and Sheldeen had some time for picture taking.  There was lots of food at the reception.  Instead of just finger foods, they served  real food too!  They had stuffed shells, muscles, crab cakes, lechon, pasta.  Man I was so stuffed after that.  Some of the guests didnt know about the dinner afterwards and ate till they could not eat anymore.   Kim invited a lot of guests!  Most of his co-workers from the airport were there.  Some even came from out of town like Kim's old manager who flew in from Chicago.  Another coworker flew in from Florida.  Kim even invited his ex-girlfriend who drove from New Jersey with her husband.  She was so emotional, and had a tear in her eye.  Not for Kim though.  Dot told me that Edna was very close to her family.  Edna hasnt seen the whole family together in a long  time.   The band was great!  Island Magic played a lot of dance music mostly from the 70's and early 80's.  They did play a medley of songs from the 60's which was cool.  Everyone got up from their seats everytime they played.  A few still had to be pryed from their seats but the best man got them up to dance.  I must say that the wedding was great.  Dot and I danced more in this wedding than any other.  She even let me teach her other cousins to boggie, swing and merengue.  I was so tired, that I was amazed that I could still drive home.  Didnt drink that much.  All I had was a Seabreeze and one beer.  One of these days I will work on editing the video we took and compress it for internet use.  More to come. ~NET

       SCARECROW  Gene Hackman and (Dustin Hoffman?  Al Pacino?  I always get them mixed up.  I think it's Pacino) are brilliant in this early 70's masterpiece of the "gritty realism" psychodrama genre.  Some icky moments, especially a prison-attempted-rape-scene, but worth it.  Don't think I've seen it since its theater release 30 years ago, though - I'll have to remedy that.  Watched  Monsters, Inc.  on DVD this weekend - much better than its reviews.  Captivating story, and very good job of creating a fantasy universe that explains our own "observed" interactions with monsters (kids' closets, Loch Ness sightings), without being too grownup about it.

      NEVER BEEN KISSED  So on Mondays I go out bowling and I thought that was enough to break the routine of baby sitting Logan everyday of the week.  Though I enjoy Logan a lot, like our trips to the park -the way he throws his arms around my back and giggles and our library  time together where he gets to be around other  2 year olds.  After Logan leaves for the day in my head I hear him baby talking, which is so cute mind you, it sounds like this  Dhatt one, Dhiss one, Nhooo. Mommma??? Uh hoo?  Dhatt way!! this is when he realizes you are back to your own street and he does not want to return to home  base yet.  It's not enough that I repeat all this things to Ric on the phone (to get it out of my system) who by the way never tires of hearing them, although I know I repeat myself a lot ( i do realize that, after the fact).  So Friday comes and in the desire for adult conversation, goes to the west side, plays mahjong with my favorite pals, Francis, Lenni, Merci -finishes by early morning -not to worry I don't babysit Logan on week ends.  The group plans to be at Tommy's tonight for some dancing--I'll see if I still am up for it tonight, got some housekeeping to do.  Enjoy your week end guys  And Ching My Big Fat... is it out on  dvd  yet????

       ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS   Dumb humor is the best humor.  Hey nonny nonny nonny...  The latest shooting happened by our old townhouse - we lived outside Manassas from '87 to '89.  You're probably right, Josephine, the hype is most likely puffing up the killer.  Maybe the police are hoping to lure him out.  Glad we don't live there anymore.  And it sounds like you and I are at just about the same place!  I'll be 50 in 2 1/2 years, and Kim and I will have been married 26 years then (if she can put up with me that much longer...).  Happy birthday.

      EVENING STAR  (Shirley MacLaine /Jack Nicholson)  The shootings in Maryland and Virginia, is kind of creepy.  In the movies, they try not to at least leak out that all now 8 shootings are connected.  If they do  have  evidence they are connected, try to keep it secret, so that it is not  magnified in the media and feed the culprits' ego.  Like when they said on camera that school should go on as usual, there is no indication that schools are targeted and them boom, a school kid got hit on the way to school.    Thanks Ching and Pia for the birthday greetings.  In 2 years I will be 50 and married 25 years. That means I would have been 50% single and 50% married all my life. So that eventually my married life will outnumber my single life so I am determined to make my married life fun, fullfilling and exciting ..........and that means Ric has to leave me alone from time to time.

      YOUNG AT HEART (Frank Sinatra)  Thanks, Pia.  I guess  I always have the two confused.  You see I grew up where recipes have to make do with what you have in your pantry or refrigerator.

       OCTOPUSSY   Tita Jo, I know how to cook both the pinakbet and the bulanglang.  Preparing for both dishes are somewhat the same except for a few things.  Pinakbet has fish bagoong and tomatoes.  Bulanglang has shrimp bagoong and no tomatoes.  Anyhow, I hope I answered your question. I apologize for the people I confused with this blog.  You'll only get it if you eat filipino dishes. :)

Hey - 'saright w/me if you wanna join the  urlLink FlipBlogs webring , counting me, we're, like 85% Filipino/a, right?  Unless you count Brian, too, but he hasn't posted...  Big movie weekend for Kim & me, saw  The Tuxedo  (eh...), and  I Am Trying to Break Your Heart , a documentary about the making of Wilco's last album - I loved it (the movie), Kim was bored.  Went out and bought the new CD after, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, really liked that...  Also bought  The Exorcist  and  The Graduate , haven't watched yet.  Believe it or don't, I never saw The Exorcist, though I read the book ( before the movie came out - am I old or what? ).  They're way cheap at Sam's Club this week.  VHS, anyhow, didn't look for DVD.

Looks like a couple of birds will be able to fit my belly for Thanksgiving.  Dot will be impressed of my determination.  I hope to lose at least 10 lbs by next Thursday and I am also determined to keep it off.  I have renewed faith in my health kick.  Wish me luck on my quest.    more to come...  NET

       Yellow Submarine   My uncle and my sister are big Beatles Fans.  Its the animated Beatles movie featuring Nowhere man and other interesting characters.  Not sure if it is DVD.  The first time I saw this movie was on PBS during a cold stormy night that made our night much warmer.  In less than two weeks, it will be Thanksgiving.  I am hitting the gym this week twice per day just to make sure I am ready for the food that will be filling me belly.  Lately, Dot has noticed the belly growing.. I am starting to look a couple of months pregnant.  Eating junk at work has made me gain about 15 pounds in the last 8 weeks or more!  Im even starting to think about running 2 miles a day just to lose the weight.  Gotta stay focused.  Any suggestions? I did a search in Yahoo and Google, I dont see a lot of interesting movies that begin with Y.  How about other things that begin with Y can that suffice for a word instead of a movie?  How about Actors whose name begins with Y?  Y? because we like you....M.. O.. U... S...E...   more to come.  NET

      END OF A DYNASTY   -   (The Kennedy Story)   Ching, the movie game was fun in the beginning,  but then it gets old -especially if we start using movie titles that we have nott even seen.    Why don't we agree to start our blogs with current events.  Things we may have heard in the news that day  or that week.  It can be politics,  crimes, sports, fashion, etc.  This way we can continue to share interests.  Like I would be blogging about the Williams sisters finally losing in the Indian Wells tournament.  Well it was always that they were dominating the majors. Like  was always that 2 of them battling it out in the finals.  In the semi finals this year  Venus W had  retire because of a leg injury, he sustained while battling Monica Seles,  so Kim Clisters of Australia won.  Kim has been playing so well tho (girlfriend of current no 1  Hewitt also of Australia).  And Kim finally beat Serena W in the finals, I did not get to watch the game, I was busy running around but I just check the results in the internet.  But when great people play espcially on a one to one situation, I can't miss the ummmmp..... and ahhhhhhhhh as they battle how to close out a point. Can you imagine, they anticipate, run, hit all in one rush of a moment.  Mind you though, you don't have to be interested in ones current events. It would just be a gist in the beginning  and then you can proceed with personal stuff.    I wonder what golf would be like, when I watch it in TV  it makes me fall asleep (not bad).  I heard the Lakers have been losing more now than winning  (Shaq is out for a while because of a foot injury ).  No I don't play any of those games. If I do what's the point of watching other people play.  My game is bowling - I go out every Monday to bowl and be with my friends.

       REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE    He must hate me. He hates me. I know he does. He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world. He doesn't like my friends. He doesn't like one thing about me. He called me - he called me a dirty tramp. My own father. I don't know if he means it. I mean maybe he doesn't mean it, but he acts like he does. We were together. We were gonna celebrate Easter and we were gonna catch a double bill. Big Deal! So I put on my new dress and I came out, and he grabbed my face and started rubbing off all the lipstick. I thought he'd rub off my lips. And I ran out of that house. I'll never get close to anybody.

       TEXASVILLE   The twenty-years-later sequel to "The Last Picture Show" - I love Larry McMurtry!   "Thanks for the tip, Net..."   Jay/Daf here, Ching - all us guys look the same?  Oh, and thanks for the motel story link - I love English articles where the punchlines are in Tagalog.  Phhtphhtphht!  Maybe you heard our motel story before - apologies if so.  The rest aren't repeatable!  We got married on a Fall Sunday (1978) in a Detroit suburb, and were going to honeymoon in Chicago, but I had a band gig that ran 'til 2am.  We were going to try to drive through, but after 2 hours, we had only made it to Jackson (MI), and I was falling asleep.  so we pulled off at an exit, and found the dumpiest motel I'd ever seen, but we were too exhausted to go on.  so we grabbed a room, tried to make the best of it, but the couple in the next room was incredibly loud.  All night long, the girl was shouting  "Ohh, Walter!  Unnhh-unnhh-unnhh-yes!  Walter!  Walter!"   Kim was just miserable - the first night of our eternity together, and we get loud amateur porn through the wall all night.  She cried herself to sleep.  We woke up the next morning to more of Walter and his loud friend - not sure if the headboard was slamming into the wall, or her head was slamming into the headboard.  The rest of the honeymoon was much nicer - a highrise hotel in downtown Chicago with a view of the Lake from our room, and an excellent romantic restaurant downstairs.  And "Ohh Walter..." is still a running joke, probably 'cos I won't let it die, but Kim pretends not to think I'm an idiot.  Isn't she just the best?

       YANKEE DOODLE DANDY   Ching just wanted to thank you for fixing my blog archives.  :) Sorry I wasn't able to talk to you today.  I wanted to call you after class but my class wasn't dismissed until 10 PM.  I think you were sleeping by then.  I'll try to keep in touch sometime this weekend.

       ARMY OF DARKNESS   The third installment on Sami Ramie's Evil Dead series.  It was kinda more of a comedy than heart stomping horror.   My mom told me today that my Tito Neils killed himself.  He was my uncle who I used to hang out with Saturday mornings when I was still growing up in the Philippines.  I would go to his house and help him make model WWII airplanes and tanks.  We would modify Revel's prefabricated plastic models and make them more real looking by sodering holes on the panels and air brushing black and silver paint to make burn effects.  I remember one time he wasnt home and I started working on this Sherman Tank he was making.  He entered the room as I was playing around with it and broke a piece from the gun and he got upset.  I ran home crying and finding answers to why he got mad at me?  Thats the day I learned not to mess around with peoples things when they are not around.  I am still trying to figure out why he would do such a terrible thing like killing himself.  He is survived by his wife and 2 kids who live in a place called Marikina.  Nelson Palad-May God bless his soul  NET

Anyway, can you see the disparity between Brian's webcam and mine?  It sucks, doesn't it?  Which is why I ordered Logitech's QuickCam 4000 the other night.  I can't wait until it comes!  Man, can you imagine a webcam with 1.3 megapixels and digital zoom and a built-in mic?  It has better features than my Cybershot!  Whoa!!

      Supernova  I would love to go to the Philippines! I need to save up my vacation time so I can make the trip worth while. I was told that i would need at least a month. I am hoping to save up my vacation time and Ching and I will try to go some time in the early spring of 2004. Thats when we origionally planned it. We dont think we will have any children by then but you never know with those kind of things. Nature has a way of springing that kind of stuff on you. Its not like we are trying to have a kid, but then we are not really trying to NOT have a kid either.   Man I wish I could win the lottery. I hate working!

      THREE KINGS    -       Ching and Brian I believe is not ready to go home to Philippines.  I know they both would love to go.  As for Ric and me our flight will take us directly to Negros.   The house in Manila has already been sold.    Ric's family and mine are all in Negros  so we need as much time of the 3 weeks we allocated for this vacation to spend with them.   I"m sure Ching and Brian will visit soon.

       GHOST    Thanks for the info, Tita. It's been a long time since my last post. I really had no idea. BTW, when will you come back to the Phils? I would love to see you and it would also be an opportunity for me to send something for my best friend. I wasn't able to send her a wedding gift. But it would be better if Ching can come along with you.

      GOODWILL HUNTING   -Matt Damon, Ben Affleck  (The young guys co wrote the movie, and I think this was when they both won for best script??, anyways this movie started it all for these guys)  Hello She, best regards to you and your family.  Anyways (FYI)  Chingay and company decided that there is a game in the golden sushi posting wherein -you start your post with a movie title that starts with the last letter of the movie last posted, hence  Scorpion Kin (G)   - (G)oodWill Hunting.    We had a birthday party for  Ching.   I can't wait to see the pictures posted. I'd say Ric is not done steam vacuuming  our house. That probably is it for this year,  as we prepare for our trip to the Phil.  Of course Jen's birthday is coming up, we would probably much rather have that in the restaurant.

       NIGHT AND DAY   a movie flick starring Cary Grant.  Its supposely based on the life of Cole Porter.  Not sure if this is true.  Anyway, nostalgic as it is.. it was filmed way before I was born.  1946. At hour 15 and 1 minute Chris Pirillo at Call for Help-athon lost his sanity and started laughing madly nonstop.  Morgan Webb had to relieve him of his dutyship for a while.  I applaude him for his staying power.  I thought he would crack after 9 hours.  Speaking of staying power I have watched the Helpathon now for over 6 hours and I am starting to get beat.  Anyway I will have to give Dot some quality time this weekend for letting me watch my favorite channel on cable for the most part of the day and all night.  I did get to bring my car to the shop for its tuneup and inspection.  Turns out the rear brake drums also needed to be replaced.  I guess the frequent braking in the snow took its tool the night before.  I spent an extra hundred simoleons to replace it.    more to come.  NET

       ENTER THE DRAGON  Oh my I almost forgot about greeting my Golden Sushi Family!  Merry Christmas everyone!  I am currently watching TechTV's Call for Helpathon.  Its 18 hours of fact filled Call for Help with Chris Perillo.  I wonder how he will turn out after 18 hours of work.  I know I start acting silly just working 12 hours.  In between this helpathon I will be dropping off my car to get an oil change and an emissions inspection.  Its gonna be a trek since we received about 5 inches of snow yesterday.  I even drove during the peak snow time.  My family spent Christmas day with our Tita Josie.  We opened our gifts there and also sang songs on her new Kareoke machine.  This machine was AWESOME!  Who would have thought that you could have over 200 songs placed inside a computer chip that can be placed inside a microphone!  Did I say this machine was AWESOME?  It had voice pitch control, song speed control, echo effects just to name a few.  It even had a option to add another chip for MORE Songs!  That is Awesome!  My sister, brother in law and I started hogging the mikes after we ate the fabulous food that Tita Josie cooked.  I think the highest score we got was 98?  Yes thats right on top of all this machine does, I also gives you a Score!    Snow driving was a challenge.  My brother in law followed me as I plowed through the snow with my wider tires. He had standard tires on his Accord.  What normally took me 15 minutes drive took me an hour and a half.   Can we start using Tagalog Movies as titles?  more to come...  NET

      NEVADA  -    As I was growing up, I was aware that my mother Maria had a very admirable figure. Remember she married at 16, (after one boy, she had me when she was 20). Even in that old, backward exotic town, they know sexy when they see one (they probably don't know what to call it). Men and women talk about her, like I was not there.  Women I guess say how she was just blessed with good body because back then women don't do anything more of what  they have.  I was 16 when I realized what those comments meant (my mother then was 36) so she had long ways to go to be still young  and not aware of what she is or what she got.  But really, how she got that body, she would tell me.  It was going uphill to a farm,  (where even a tricycle can 't climb anymore,) on foot and coming down with a sack of sweet potatoes, or a sack of rice from  their small farm and bringing it down where the tricycle would be waiting to bring them back home.  And washing clothes by hand in a nearby river, all through out her  young life.   No she does not live like that  anymore. I made it a point that she is better after my college and I got a job.  She is now 70 and her only problem is anthritis. And she now has gone heavier with age.    In a way, I knew I had my mother's genes and did not have to worry about my weight till 40, I know I will  begin to get the weight after 50, just like my mother. Tho I can't remember her heavy really until she was 60.  It's funny how I live my life aware of what my mother was, how she lived      -and I know my mother is living vicariously through me  ... college degree, a good 10 year career running that made me travel to Europe, my decision to retire and take care of Logan, I tell her everything as she absorbs them like it was her own.  When I had Ching for the first time and I told her   "now I know exactly how you feel about me".  And now I have Logan and I said " oh my  God, I'm just like you" Wait till you hear stories of how she handled her marriage to  my father who was 10 years older.  He was 26, but still 10 years older.........

       NOWHERE TO RUN   I'm not much of a Van Damme fan, but we're running out of "N" movies.  I had to get Brian's help on this one.  He is the ultimate movie geek.  He'd give the movie geek of Beat the Geeks a run for his money!  By the way, MOM --  Never Say Never Again  has already been used.  Only 12 more hours until we get to see LOTR The Two Towers tomorrow.  We're sitting off to the side this time, 10A (still front row, though).  Usually we get 6A or 7A (center front), but we were too late this time.  Brian bought the tickets yesterday (two days in advance) but it was still too late to get our usual seats.  It seems we've under-estimated the movie's popularity!

      NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN  -  another James Bond movie  MEDIOCRE -not the movie!  real life.  I receive a notice from the home owners association  that if we all switch to this one trash service, we all will get good rates (about 15.00 dollars less) plus we will be saving our streets from various trash traffic.  I say makes sense, so I signed up for that right away effective Feb 2003, because from my old trash collector I have paid until Jan 2002.  As I will be out of the country in Jan, I decided to call the old collector to inform them to cancell service effective end Jan.  Apparently Dec is too early to cancel (I don't understand) , as in too soon to break up???  (if you are dating) too soon to return an item (that doesn't fit???).  What's too early about that  and told me to call back -when the end of Jan comes.....  Anyways, Ching their no is 5242000,  if you get a bill from them for the next three months then please call them to cancell. Am I alone in this planet who thinks if something is to be done sooner or later, better soon and forget about it.  You'd think if I call them to tell them I want their service in June, they won't  say my call was too soon.  They will find a way to make sure they get my business when the time comes.

      RETURN  of a MAN CALLED HORSE  -     So I am again going home to my home where according to the story I almost died of scabies. According to my neighbors and my Mom as a baby I had to be wrapped in banana leaves because cloth would stick to my body.  And I have to be bathed in young boiled guava leaves to sanitize me.    College took me away from this home a week at a time. My allowance was only good for a week, my father was paid weekly. I take a bus to the nearest city, live with one of my relatives and at that time got in one of the best colleges in the province SILLIMAN UNIVERSITY.   My parents were so proud of me getting to college not only was it most expensive at that time, you have to get a qualified grade point to get in. It took the most out of their resources.  My mother who never went as far as high school, married at 16 (as was the norm at that time at that place).  I got the idea and probably understood although not spoken clearly (my mother was afraid it would offend some sensibilities) that I could find a suitable boyfriend in the university and if not that my education will take care of my future.  Pretty much, I think my mother is right.

       (the) NUTTY PROFESSOR   The free underwear is actually a quarterly thing, Net..&nbsp; I look forward to it everytime because usually it's to entice you buy from the newest line that they have.&nbsp; Many years ago the free offer was only for a white color of the newly released line.&nbsp; The last three I've received were all for the Body by Victoria (the first one being white only & the other two were for any color).&nbsp; I hope next year, they'll start pushing a different line.  I love the free offers!&nsbp; I even got a free purse spray bottle of the Body by Victoria fragrance through one of those postcards!&nbsp; I love how you get it without having to buy anything, unlike some of the other offers that you get nowadays.&nbsp; I used to feel bad and buy stuff that I don't need anyway just for the sake of buying something while I redeem my gift.&nbsp; I'm glad to report that I'm over that.&nbsp; I just go in, get my free gift and leave.&nbsp; As the Romans say,  vini vedi vici !  You can chalk that up to one of two things: I've gotten more thick-skinned with age or eversince I moved out, I've been poor and can't afford to be so frivolous anymore.&nbsp; Probably a combination of both.

       EXIT to EDEN   Went to the Broadway Mall in Hicksville today.  Yes, Hicks ville is a real town here in New York.   Anyhoot, Dot and I walked into the local Delias and were looking at the clearance items in the back of the store.  As Dot was looking for clothes for her little cousins, I spied this book called Girlfriend Slam Book.  I was going over this book when I had the idea that this can also be used for Single Mans Slam Book.  It has subject lines like  Name Address yada yada yada.  But, it also has lines like Zodiac Sign, Likes, Dislikes and also a GIRL-O-Meter which can be called a HOT-O-Meter for the single guys.  I also liked the section where you can put a photo of the girl you are Slamming.  Dot didnt find it amusing, but I certainly did.  Moving right along, our next shop attack was the Disney Store.  They had 10 dollar medium stuff toys which I found highly unusual because Disney rarely puts anything less than 10 dollars unless the item was little trinkets.  I spied on the new electronic Stitch stuff toy which talks back at you.  The responses become repetitive after 8 or so statements but I found it amusing for 15 minutes.  I had 3 Stitches talking to each other by the time Dot passed by to pull me out of the store.  The Disney welcome girl didnt find my networking the Stitches very amusing.  They were still talking to each other when we met up with Dots cousin Kathy and we decided to revisit Disney.  Speaking of silly gifts.  Be on the lookout in the mail if youre an avid receiver of the Victorias Secret catalog.  They send this post card for a FREE yes thats right FREE Panty just for visiting your local VS.  Dot picked up her free panty and I got the opportunity to see the latest thongs on the mannequins and also on the sales clerks as they bent over to pick up boxes on the floors, God bless em.     more to come.

      NINE TO FIVE   " 9 TO 5"   -   I know there is a movie of this title, I see Dolly Parton in this movie and that comediane with the straight hair and bangs and wide mouth. Her name skips my mind. But I should know her, because I remember she even starred opposite John  Travolta (one of my favorites -) oh got it Lily  Tomlin.  I keep confusing myself that Melanie Griffith was in this film when in fact Melanie was totally all by herself with Harrison Ford in   Working Girl.   I have not been sleeping as early as I want these days. I keep flipping channels and I find movies that get me  interested and I get to watch them till end around 2:00 am. One night it was THE GIFT ,  and then MONSTERS BALL  ( Halle and billy Bob). I must admit they were pretty good.  the irony of it is the girls have been calling me to  out and I have been  making excuses not to go, it's cold, just want to rest (actually too lazy).  And then I realize that if I did go out I would just be walking in the door at 2  and not in bed since 8 and  realizing that I am still awake by 2.   But then I guess it's different when you decide between spending time with yourself rather than with others.

      NINJA KIDS  -Filipino version of teen movie during the Ninja craze in the 80's.  Long before I had a choice of what movies to see, I don't remember exactly at what age that was maybe as early as my elementary grade school - my father have introduced  me to Sean Connery, Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson. Back then there was no rating and  kids just tag along.  Boy are these guys as old as my father????  My father is now 80 and I'm going to see him again this trip. We used to take special trips to the city (as we live in a barrio) with only one movie theathre, so we can go see this kind of movies in first run theathres...  Of course that kind of bonding seized, when  later in high school -I hated him for scaring the boys away (just like Bronson in his movies).  Now when Ric sees an old   Charles Bronson movie, he  says theres Papang Joe.  Sean  Connery is even sexier now, I guess because of how he has aged. Not many men can aged that well.  And Clint Eastwood???.

       urlLink Never Say Never Again    Kim can get all goofy over Pierce Brosnan all she wants, he's no Sean Connery.  Actually, she likes Sean NOW - now that he looks like Kenny Rogers.  All together now:  "Kenny Rogers? EEEWWWW!!!"  Our kids manage to get us hooked on what we watch.  I was always a trekkie, but it was Andy who got Kim watching Voyager.  And the Simpsons.  And it was Jess who got us watching The Practice and Angel (Angel looks just like her OLD boyfriend) and Friends.  Kim's also a big fan of Frasier and of Everybody Loves Raymond.  ELR (and Home Improvement before it) really do a pretty good job with husband-and-wife stuff.  And Doris Roberts is brilliant as the mother-in-law-from-Hell.  Anybody else remember her from when she worked with Pierce Brosnan in Remington Steele? Which brings us back to the start of this post.

       ENOUGH   Speaking of Jennifer Lopez films.. I think I'm going to drag Brian to see  Maid in Manhattan !  I can almost hear him protesting now!!  LOL!  To the TAGBOARD VIOLATORS: no cursing --- puhleeeese!  NET: I thought TSS stood for Toxic Shock Syndrome?  I am so clueless!  DAF: We just saw Pierce Brosnan in  Die Another Day .. I'm with Kim on this one.  He's still very hot!  p.s. You really need to watch Smallville, DAF!  The Chloe that I'm talking about is the one in Smallville.  She has a crush on Clark, who has a crush on Lana (BTW NET, it's Lang).. It's a bit of a love triangle and an amusing one at that!

       (THE) ROAD TO WELLVILLE   Never saw it, don't know much about it.  Lotsa nudity, I heard.  Woo hoo.  I haven't asked Kim, but I think I know her list: Phil Collins Kenny Rogers ( ewww!!! ) Pierce Brosnan Dylan McDermott Patrick Stewart  Chloe (from  Angel , right?) IS pretty hot.  And I used to like Jeri Ryan, until  Boston Public .  Musta been her space suit.  Ot maybe that Borg thing on her face.    WAY back in the day (before any of you were born, except Josephine), it was Sally Struthers - I Think I've mentioned  Five Easy Pieces  before?  Anyhow, it was all over by the time  All in the Family  came on.  I'm so fickle.

        urlLink 1984    The movie version from the novel by George Orwell.  With the internet and cams all over even in a Kinko's near you, whos to say Big Brother isnt watching.  Speaking of watching, SciFi is premiering their new series called TAKEN.  Its produced by Steven Spielberg a must see for all you buffs out there.  Knowing these cable channels it will be repeating all night so if you missed the beginning wait a few hours and you will see the beginning AGAIN.  I like the Chloe hairstyle Ching!  Didnt notice it was her hairstyle at first.  Did you know that you can view her computer's contents online?  Finally you can virtually view an IMAC online.  My brother says you can even look into her trash folder and view the JPG files she deleted from her desktop.  I wonder if there are any pornography in there?  (wink)   Heres my list:  Lana Lane (from Smallville of course)  Kelly Packard (from Ripley's)  still remember her from California Dreams - Teen NBC   urlLink Kate Botello  (former TECHTV show host)  lastly,  urlLink Morgan Webb  (TSS show specialist)   Gosh Im such a GEEK! ~NET

As Ms. Morissett (sp?) would say -- isn't it ironic?  p.s. Brian and I got his and hers  MicroSizers  for Christmas!  Complete with sup-up kits!  His is a blue Nissan Skyline and mine is a white Subaru Impreza!  Pretty impressive, huh?  I was going to go get  ZipZaps , but my friend Sarah said they were crap. She has both and says that even though the MicroSizers cost more they are worth it because they're way better.  Besides the MicroSizers are available and the ZipZaps are completely out of stock.. In stock is better any day.

       GATTACA   It's an Ethan Hawke / Uma Thurman sci-fi flick.&nbsp; Oh, and Jude Law is in it too!&nbsp; Speaking of movies, we just saw  Treasure Planet .&nbsp; Pretty good.&nbsp; It reminds me somewhat of  Atlantis .&nbsp; Another animated film that I'm looking forward to seeing is Adam Sandler's  Eight Crazy Nights .&nbsp; He's a really funny guy!  Anyway, I have to do some plugs:  the official Derby Class of '96 website  (it's still up after all these years ~ I mean, I've been through chingay.com, chingay.net, no domain and goldensushi.net and it is STILL there).&nbsp; It's run by Ryan of  RyanandMichelle.com .&nbsp; He did a really good job on both websites, too!  p.s. To all you Smallville fans out there..&nbsp; Have you noticed how I went from Lana Lang hair to Chloe hair? (Check out the new haircut, November 30th fresh, in the webcam!&nbsp; Don't mind the Blogger t-shirt which seems to be a favorite of mine lately..)&nbsp; Brian has a thing for Chloe!&nbsp; I told Man @ Planet Hair that I'm growing my hair back long after this cut, though.&nbsp; I think she was a bit concerned that I wouldn't be coming by to see her anytime soon, but I reassured her that I'd return for reshaping quite frequently (this cut was actually a result of the last one growing out of shape).  Brian who is a Master Cuts regular has been trying to convince me to go there for the color weave that I've been wanting..&nbsp; Believe it or not I actually tried to schedule it with Man (even though Planet Hair charges $90 for just the color weave alone).&nbsp; Fortunately she was booked very tight so her schedule allowed time for just a haircut.&nbsp; I'm glad that it didn't happen because I probably would've regretted the extravagant expenditure a few days later.&nbsp; Brian always tells me that I really can't afford to go to the salon that I go to even though I'm convinced that I can.&nbsp; I think Brian's gotten a haircut from my salon only two times and one of those times I paid for it (June Filipino ball 2001: he got his hair cut and frosted, I had an updo and make-up, total cost about $150 for both of us).  For now I think my hair shall remain the same pristine black that it's always been.

       Never Give a Sucker an Even Missouri Break  W. C. Fields and Marlon Brando are Sumo wrestlers turned bounty hunters, on the trail of Jack Nicholson.  Fields lets Brando do the dirty work, as he drinks and wisecracks his way through the adventure, surreptitiously writing a movie script about it, which he hopes to sell.  Attempting to sell the script leads to its own set of adventures, where Brando returns the "favor", offering Fields no help as one misfortune after another befalls him.  Ching, I'm in for a quarter a pin.  Bowl good!    I briefly considered coming up with a movie title that began with  Frankenstein , but rejected it.  And  Breakdance  would have been funnier than  Missouri Breaks  for a second movie, but the title was actually  Breakin' .

       You Light Up My Life With Father  It's the turn of the century (the last one, not this one), Dad (William Powell), a successful accountant, tries to run his family like a business, doesn't realize it's not working.  Daughter Laurie (Did Conn) wants to leave the weirdness behind and become an actress, but finds that she's particularly good at accountant jokes, and gets a career in vaudeville instead.  Things return to weird, though, when Dad comes to see her show, and is recognized by a dancer as one of her "clients".  Hi Yasmin!  Ching, you're the writer and the talent.  We just lurk in your shadow.  I just seem to have more time on my hands - I'm scheduled to the hilt, but work is real slow.  I'll probably get my Music History essay written today - not due for another week.

       Damn Yankee Doodle Dandies   Jimmy Cagney makes a deal with the Devil (Ray Walston) so he can stop doing gangster movies and finally pursue his first love - musical comedy.  Walston puts him through Hell, where he has to listen to Jean Stapleton sing "You Gotta Have Heart".  Most memorable lyrics, at the end, when Walston changes him back to a mobster, trying to ruin his stage act, but Cagney comes through:    "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy,  Yankee Doodle t'rough and t'rough;  a real live nephew of my Uncle Guido,  Ya can't pin nuttin' on me, ya lousy screws!"   Furious at having been outwitted by Cagney, Walston takes a break from daily operation of "the family business", moves in with his nephew (Bill Bixby), disguising his horns as antennae, and convincing Bixby he is Martian, rather than the Prince of Darkness.  All references cheerfully explained, though you'd get them all if you've seen (a) Damn Yankees, (b) a few old Cagney movies, (c) My Favorite Martian, and (d) - helpful but not necessary - All in the Family.  I fixed the bolding thing at my last post by prefixing my post with [/b][/b] - if you do the same, Net, then only Glee's post will be bolded.

       (THE) MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM  THIS one's Sinatra.  I think.  Y'know, Ching, I don't mind updating my defs - usually do it right at the end of my session, so I'm risking a little, but I've been virus-free for 2 years now (knock on formica)!  BTW, it appears the Egg and I was the prototype for Green Acres.  A brilliant show.  Saw Lord of the Rings and the new Star Trek.  Both pretty good.    I'm going to go play with my slide rule now...

       I AM SAM    Be aware that there is a new worm virus going around.   If you are on my email list, you should have received the fix by email already.  I didn't notice anything odd, but I searched my C:Drive for the files that they mentioned anyway -- better to be safe, than sorry.  I wasn't infected.  I'm sure that even if I didn't infect you guys, someone else on your email list might have acquired it and you may still be at risk.  Help yourselves by keeping informed and, more importantly, keeping your virus definitions up-to-date (I know everyone hates that -- I hate it too).

I'm going to need finished articles by March 15 at the latest and that will give me about a week or so to build the site so we can launch in April 1 (April Fool's Day -- how fitting!)..  Anyway, do you guys think you could give me tentative titles for what your contribution/piece is going to be?  Just curious.. I was hoping to get this info ahead of time so we can get a theme going.. Let me know okay?

       Stuart Little Saves His Family  Stuart's family was strange enough before he came along - low self-esteem, Mom was a borderline depressive,  Dad couldn't hold a job, and everyone thought they were weird.  Then Stuart (voice of Al Franken) came along, and things got worse.  Stuart looked exactly like a mouse, and never grew to more than 6 inches tall.  But somehow Stuart survived the constant insults by his father (Hugh Laurie), smothering of his mom (Geena Davis), and teasing by his playmates, and became a famous crisis counselor, eventually helping even his own family overcome their special challenges.  We could all learn something from Stuart's daily mantra:  I deserve good things, I am entitled to my share of happiness. I refuse to beat myself up. I am an attractive person. I am fun to be with. For a mouse, anyhow.   Also features Laura San Giacomo as Stuart's sister, and Michael J. Fox as the voice of young Stuart.  Watch for special cameo by Stephen (Flounder) Furst as leader of Stuart's first sensitivity group.  I'm in, Ching.  Woefully underqualified, but in anyhow...  Thanks for your confidence.  Oh, and check this out:  ever lose stuff on the internet cos some dotcom or isp went belly-up?  Has your favorite site disappeared?  I bet they have it at  urlLink archive.org !

       Cats and Reservoir Dogs   I'm no good at coming up with movie plots -- I can name titles to no end, but coming up with a witty plot to go with it is another story -- and Brian is busy taking surveys on the internet (he said he gets paid for it -- what?) so he won't help me.  Good tip, Net.  I'm thinking of turning Golden Sushi into an online mag (we're keeping the blog of course -- just moving it to goldensushi.net/blog or blog.goldensushi.net instead) will you guys write for me?  I figured Daf will do the M&M section (movies and music) and Net can do T&T (tech and travel).. What do you guys think?

       First BloodSport  Rambo and Van Damme duel to the death in the Kumite where only the best fighter will prevail.  Rambo ran away from the law and now trains to defeat the prevailing champion Frank W. Dux played by Van Damme.  All blood, guts, and fury.  Dot's cousin Stephanie is selling  urlLink Cutco .  Shes using the job as marketing experience for college.  After all she is an undergrad in NYU's Stern.  Prior to her first presentation, Stephanie was crudely attempting to cut a penny to resemble a falic corkscrew.  Sad to say that she failed miserably.  Dot and I visited Stephanie at her dorm as she was preparing for her presentation.  I tried to make one too and at first encountered failure.  The penny looked like a mangle tool whit pieces of it sticking upward.  It resembled a small pinwheel.  Then I figured out a trick by using the back edges of the Cutco scissors the penny buckled, twisted and I formed it to look like a corkscrew.  This left Stephanie enthusiastically happy and I showed her my trick to making it.  She then asked me to help me with her presentation.  Dot was just smiling.  We took the train to our friend Peter's apartment who was Stephanie's appointment for the night.  When we got there, Stephanie did her schtik and won Peter over with her presentation.  I gave an impromtu show with the penny cutting and when the show was over.  Peter was ready to buy the big knife for his kitchen. He gave Stephanie some constructive criticism about her presentation.  Steph took it positively.  We were so glad that she was handling herself professionally that Dot and I gave her some referrals. Dot's other cousin Kathy arrived later for the show.  She was a little more light mannered and comedically criticized her presentation. "Knives?  Why would I want a knife that costs 3 times as much as what I already have?".  Stephanie gave her scripted reply "These knives arent your normal variety knives...".  Although Kathy didnt buy anything, she applauded Stephanie for her professionalism.  Anyone interested in the greatest knife in the world? =)  April, you are going to Vegas?  Sweet!  My advice is to book the car rental from the airport.  The rentals at the hotels are almost double what it costs at the airport.  The trick to commuting around Las Vegas is WALKING.  One can visit more casinos in a day just by walking.  Parking is a bitch any time of day.  If you find one in the lots.. its probably far from the casino and you will have to walk anyway.  They have trams that take you from casino to casino this is an alternative to walking.  Schedule the rental when you will be taking road trips out of the Vegas Strip.  more to come NET

       Of Mice and Men In Tights  Just kinda writes itself, huh?  Saw Chicago last week.  Brilliant!  Tip - after seeing Chicago, rent "All That Jazz", a thinly veiled biography of Bob Fosse, whose play this was in the first place.  Bonus factoid: ATJ was the inspiration for one of my favorite videos of all time, Paula Abdul's "Cold Hearted".  Kim had surgery today - she'll be in hospital until Monday, total recovery time 4-6 weeks.  She had a lot of pain right after the surgery, but the Demerol is helping now - as long as she doesn't cough.  Jessica's really going to have to step up to the plate and handle Alyssa (almost 19 months old now) - Alyssa still treats Kim more like she's her mom than Jess is.

          Watched Daredevil yesterday.. Very good. Jennifer Garner played a good Electra, Michael Clarke Duncan was great as Kingpin (even though, Brian insists that he should have been white, but I counter that you cannot find a white guy actor who will fit the role better than the guy that was chosen -- he was perfect) and I loved Colin Farrell as Bullseye.  As far as Ben Affleck goes, well you know how I feel about him (whiny ass)!  LOL!  He was okay.  The effects were great.  Nice cameos from Stan Lee and Kevin Smith.  Great movie!  Will definitely add it to the to-buy list!

Early Saturday morning, I was awaken by Dot's cousin who told me that I had to get ready so that I can drive them to the store to get ready for the parade.  I took a quick shower and drove them over.  It was pretty hectic at the store.

You paid for that course and I think you deserve to be given a chance to take that test.

      April:  "...since i dnt hav d body of a stripper..."   Daf:  "You haven't been to some of the clubs I'VE been to."   Seriusly, though, I was actually thinking casino / restaurant / bar work.  But foot-in-the-door hospital work's a really good idea.  Sometimes they'll even pay for your schooling!

      OMG, April!  That is a reason for a lawsuit.  Where theres a will, there is a way.  If you really love nursing, in NY you can become a nurse with just 2 years of training!  Some schools are not even accredited as a college.  For one to spend so much time to learn a profession in such a long period of time is ludicrus these days.  But if you will not pursue nursing, LV is a great place for a construction worker.  One can work from 1am to 8am and sleep the hot day off.  Maybe you can be a 'JOE'y Millionaire' earning $19,000.00 a year.  =)  But seriously, there are lots of opportunity in Vegas.  My cousin moved there, he is a civil engineer for one of the building companies and owns a home about 5 miles from the "Strip".  more to come... NET

      Wow, April.  That really sucks.  Teachers who think the earth revolves around their class and their proclamations are the worst.  BTW, the dean could always do something if he/she wanted to.  Those contracts aren't legally binding...  Good luck.  There's gotta be a lot of work in Vegas, right?

      well, i'M so torn rite now bec the nursing schools are just fucking me big time in texas. i'M in vegas now, and i'M trying to check out the nursing schooLs here. *sigh* it feels as if i'M blocked by waLLs every which way i go. mom is freakin' out on me bec i mite move here 2vegas, but my cousin MicheLLe, the one who's been beggin me 2move-in w/her is such a disappointment. evn if she knew i wuz cmin here, i havent done a thing for the past two days. iVe slept on the floor and iVe slept w/a guy, her #2boi's hausmate, and i hafta share his bed w/his dog. i'M at my couzin Jon's haus and thank the good Lord he has the net and a room of my own... and a nice bed! i'LL write my article asap kc i wont bee goin 2schooL anymore. i'M heLL-depressed rite now, but there's nothin eLse i cLd do. the teacher is refusing 2give me and 6other peopLe the exam, which counts 40%of out finaL grade, bec we were 5mins late-due2 car accident blocking the freeway exit &we were stuck in traffic. that basicaLLy means i faiLed the course. ders nuttin d dean can do, bec we signed a contract w/our teacher there's NO exempxns w/d rules. AND if i faiL one nursing class, i'M out of the program. AND it's 2late 4us 2drop. plus, accdg 2texas laws, my 1997 prerequisite classes have expired bec it's been 5yrs. ergo, i must retake them again. it's just aLL bullshit. i'M prayin 4things 2get better and this is supposed 2b my yr, but so far, it aint goin as i pictured it. i'M sooo tired of schooL. i'M soo tired of living w/my mom. i jst dunno enimore =o(

      I just skimmed, but it looked like you all had a great time.  Here are my articles, I think:  1 -  Dateline: Da Thumb ,  a quick introduction of me to our readers.  Emphasis on my lack of qualifications.   2 -  35 Years of Carlos ,  a look at Carlos Santana's career.  How much is substance, how much is shrewd playing of the market, and if we like the way he plays, why do we care?   3 -  I Assassin Down the Avenue ,  a review of "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart", last year's movie about Chicago's favorite indie band, Wilco.

Send me a 100 X 100 pixel headshot too!  If you don't have one send me a picture that I can make one out of.  Write about anything you want.  You could even write about your Vegas Spring Break experience.  I just need it in by March 15, if at all possible so we can put the website together!  Thanks!

      By the way, the 2003 BFKS pictures are now available.   Check 'em out!   BTW, I didn't have enough pledges to get a free sweatshirt but I wanted one so badly that I ended up pledging to myself just so I could meet the minimum pledge requirement.  How pathetic is that?  One of the people really raised $1300 all by themselves!  Can you believe it?  I told Sarah and Ash, "I know who we're going to recruit on our team next year!"  LOL!

      Brian and I were just talking about him!  I was making fun of Brian's hair the other day and told him that he looked like Alfalfa but instead of saying "Alfalfa," I said "ALFA-ALFA."  For some reason I just always put an extra "A" in there.  He promptly made fun of my pronounciation to pay me back for making fun of his goofy-looking hair.  I had to get him back so naturally I made a jibe about his spelling skills (or lack of, that is).  "At least I can spell it!"  He goes, "I can too spell it!  A-L-P-H-A-P-H-A!"  I rest my case.

      Daf,  You can contribute as much as you want.. At least 1 article per month, though.. I'm thinking more of a monthly e-zine so it's not so much work to keep up. You are free to write about anything that you like.. I just need the first one by next Saturday so I'll have time to put the site together.. Hopefully our host Fateback won't be down so much.  I'll also need a 100 x 100 pixel headshot that we can use for your byline.  Vince has already given me his.  We'll try to put the first one together and then see how it goes.  I figure we'll just wing it and learn from each issue.  What do you all think?

      Animal House on Haunted Hill.  The children of the origional animal house gang come together to hopefully reunite their long dead parents for a "Welcome Back from the Dead" reunion. But things go terribly wrong when the ghost of the long lost D-Day is jealous when he is not invited to the reunion and starts to cast his dark and disturbing shadow over the Delta house. Youll be on the edge of your seat with this hilariously distorted and sometimes morbid none stop party and blood bath.   Caution: This film contains real dead people brought back to life and will show several minutes of footage of John Belushi nude. Basically because we cant clothe the dead!

I sent over the fax and suddenly I hear someones cell phone ringing. My coworker and I just glance at each other and start laughing. Apparently, this guy gave me his phone number instead of the actual fax number. LOOOOSER!!!!

It would work anyway -- because it could probably tell that I'm a dumbass.  LOL!  Anyway, it's fixed now.

      Ching, the 'view web page' is linked to -  urlLink http://www.blogger.com/ching.imess.net/blog/ . Maybe thats why April's computer is having trouble finding the web page.  I backed spaced and deleted www.blogger.com/ from the  urlLink URL  and it brought me to Golden Sushi's Blog.  Anyhoot, I have been tossing this idea in my head to write about XML and OPML.  Lately, this has been my learning focus so be sure to watch for it in your mailbox and post it.  Friday will probably the day I finish this topic.  For those of you that have walked past  urlLink myBlog  especially on April fools day, you might have discovered something peculiar with it.  Golden Sushi's Blog was even the victim of my exploits last week.  Anyway, I will post a topic about this in the next 2 weeks.  BTW, Dot and I have decided to move in together.  She bought this house in Flushing, NY for 345K simoleons.  Of course, She and I get to have our own rooms.  Living together doesnt mean living in sin (wink) her mother has given testament that I shall not commit her daughter to the pillages of the devil. =)  Moving right along, I have given thoughts to putting up a webcam at her townhouse after we paint and fix up the place.  That should appease Mrs. Chao and so all the voyeurs out there can take a peek on  urlLink No Pants Fridays .  more to come...

      Thanks guys!  I was forced to buy my own hosting coz my free one was deleted without any notice whatsoever.  Ching and I were not sure why that happened but, oh well it was time to move on.  Besides, I always get comments from people about the pop-ups that comes out everytime my free site loads.  At least now I don't have to worry about that.  I love my hosting!  They've got lots of cool features.  I wanted to make sure to take advantage of it.  Ching and I already tried the built in chatroom, guestbook, and forum.  It's very convenient.  Anyhow, thanks Daf for signing my guestbook.  I went and visited your site as well coz I haven't stopped by there in a while.  I noticed you took out your Enetation commenting system.  It's all good though, I had your email address so I wrote you back.  Did you receive it?    In regards to Net's comment, I hope my site didn't cause your computer problems.  I definitely think there was something wrong with blogger.  It took me a while to post my blog yesterday because I kept on getting error messages.  Right now, it looks like it's working.  I don't want to jinx it.    BTW, I read the Goldensushi articles.  You guys are so awesome.  Keep up the great work.  Everyone's piece were very entertaining to read.  I look forward to reading some more.  :)  In response to comments on my really long domain name, I didn't really realize how long it was until Ching brought it to my attention.  By then it was already too late to change it.  Besides, my first name choice was already taken.

      Daf,  Tinman is Brian's dad.  He's very opinionated.  LOL!  I figured that would be really interesting.. We could have a debate.  We could even have a special page just for that.  Kind of like a HE SAID .. HE SAID (actually Point/Counterpoint sounds better).  I'm such a hick!  LOL!  I'm welcoming all sorts of contributors from all walks of life because I didn't want something homegeneous.  I like diversity.  Anyway, if Net will give me his ABOUT HIM descriptive article I can load his tech post.  I've got some cartoons that Brian is contributing but I'm waiting for his BIO NARRATIVE too.  I'm working on mine and I can't wait to get it done so I start posting my own stuff.  What did you think of the layout, though?  It's really simple but it works for me.  We can work on beautification later I guess.   I'm content with having a functional site for now.

      attention!  For those of you that have linked my blog in your websites, please take now and change the link.  The new link is: urlLink http://netzlog.blogspot.com    The ramp up to DANO has destroyed the cache settings for my old blogspot name.  I can only view an old cache file of my blog at work.  Rather than wasting the time to figure out the problem, finding a solution is more progressive.   Congratulations to the S.A. Spurs fans out there you deserve it!  You all can rub it in.  just expect the same when the Nets win next year. =)  more to come...

      Im on vacation this week.  Maybe I could write another story for the GS zine.  April, need any help proofing your writeup?  On Thursday, the gang and I are going to Great Adventures and take our chances on Superman the ride!  Let see, I have 4 more days before I have to be back at work...I have to watch The Hulk, Finding Nemo, and The Matrix Reloaded.  Sigh, at this point I might end up waiting for these movies to come out on DVD.  Ching, I liked that Ad Design for Zoloff!

      Still recovering from the Nets and Spurs final.  My congratulations to April's Team.  They played well. When it comes down to it the best team won.  Next season though, thats another story.  I use Backblog as my feedback provider.  One can post comments and add emoticons to it too!  There are extras that you can have if you pay the premium and it is easy to install just copy and paste the javascript to the body of your blog template.  Has anyone worked up some writeups for the zine? Im getting tired of seeing my mug on the top of the page =

      Hi guys! I know it's been a while since I've blogged.  I just thought I'd help April out with her question regarding the commenting system.  You can go to  urlLink Enetation  to get it for free.  Just sign up and they should be able to give you the code that you can paste to your website so you can put a comments link in your page.  If you have any questions just visit my blog and leave me a message.

      Doh!  I've been doing that lately too.  Home improvement update: Dot's Aunt hired a contractor to upgrade the kitchen and dining room floor.  The contractor quoted us a price of $800.00 which is cheap for New York standards.  I guess that how these chinese contractors win bids for jobs by quoting very cheaply.  And hiring day laborers when needed.  Were going to have fast food dinners the next few days.  Hopefully I wont gain too much.  I stopped running last week due to  urlLink heel spurs .

      Congrats to dad for finally ditching is old Ford Ranger, biting the bullet and buying a brand new car.&nbsp; He's now driving a more stylish, more reliable 2004 Toyota Corolla.&nbsp; We'll be checking it out this Saturday.&nbsp; Of course, mom's car is still much nicer.&nbsp; It's a Toyota Highlander SUV they bought brand new, around this time last year, right before my wedding.&nbsp; This is typical for Filipino households.&nbsp; The woman always has the better vehicle.&nbsp; They were actually thinking of getting a Toyota Tundra for dad (perhaps because he is partial to trucks) but my always pragmatic parents thought that it would be wasteful to drive a Tundra to and from Houston because all of the mileage will depreciate the value right away.&nbsp; Brian made a really good point when we were talking the shower the other day, though.&nbsp; Trucks are great for moving and dad moves around a lot.&nbsp; I guess he will just have to either borrow mom's Highlander (since it is an SUV and can hold a lot more than his new Corolla) or rent a UHaul trailer.  What I really find amusing about my parents is that the purchase, as usual, was totally unplanned.&nbsp; Matt picked up Logan one day.&nbsp; I guess they saw an Eddy's Toyota (where they bought mom's car last year) commercial ad on tv saying 0% financing on all 2003 models so they thought, we have nothing better to do, let's go check out cars!&nbsp; Of course, there were no more 2003 models when the got there.&nbsp; How that can happen (as big an operation Eddy's is), I know not but they ended up getting talked into buying a 2004 model with 2.9% financing.&nbsp; Not bad but with car dealerships, just like in Vegas, the house always wins.   I'm a little surprised that mom talked dad into it.&nbsp; I know it was her too because she always does this sort of thing.&nbsp; She'll spend hundreds of dollars (perhaps thousands) on furniture without even blinking.&nbsp; She is the impulsive one.&nbsp; Dad used to be really anal-retentive about stuff, researching every aspect and examining every angle before he will even say yes I'll  think  about it.&nbsp; He is more laid back now and more open to mom's whims.&nbsp;  Maybe he has mellowed in his old age (no offense, dad) or maybe he's just given up the fight.&nbsp; If you can't beat them, join them..&nbsp; Right?  Kidding aside, mom tells me that this is a necessity because dad's truck has gone to hell in a handbasket.&nbsp; It's turned into a cash cow for greedy mechanics at the auto repair shop.&nbsp; So it was a spur-of-the-moment necessity purchase, if there is such a thing.&nbsp; Mom was really happy that the dealership gave them $2000 trade in value for the truck without even looking at it.&nbsp; I think they could have squeezed another $1000 out of the deal, considering that the dealer will probably sell it for $5000 on the lot, but hey dad has mellowed and mom has always been easy (no offense to either of you).&nbsp; Lord knows how many imaginary repairs they've paid for on that truck.&nbsp; Just kidding!

      The P.O.S. crashed in our branch today. POS stands for the Point Of Sale computers or what other companies call the cash register. At about 3pm E.D.T. the POS started hashing out error codes at each station. It happened at the height of a rush at the store. We could not ring in any sales and the line in front of the counter was growing impatient. I quickly had to turn the customers out to express and having them utilize express pay cards or inserting their credit cards on the ep card readers. There were problems when they had to puchase outputs on the oversize bw plotter and the sony picture stations which were not put on the express pay system. I had to manually bill them by writing up receipts and stapling our business cards on the receipts. This could not have happened at a better time. We have 2 litigation jobs in house that have to be completed by tomorrow. I had to fan out one of these projects to the Bayside Kinko's so that it could be completed.   I also lost my cool today. Tre came in late again and inavertedly turned on one of the POS's while someone from tech support was reloading the back up from the previous day. That put a damper on our backup time by a whole hour. I flipped and started slamming a corrugated box on the kitchen counter in the witness of Tre who was shocked to see me in that state of mind. When I vent out my frustrations in a physical way, I often go overboard. I really feel bad about this action. It could ideally give me a write up from Jaba, who is on vacation, and can also be grounds for me getting fired.   We will have to see what happens tomorrow...

      I just discovered something loopy!  If WIN2K is your OS and you are operating your blog or web page in PHP or some other language other than html, you will find that the site shows a cache version of the document in internet explorer 6.0.  I discovered that when blogger was uploading all its user's blogs to  urlLink DANO .  My  urlLink blog site  in blogspot would always show up as a cache file until I removed the template I was using and loaded one of the  urlLink current blog  templates used under DANO.  Blogger was posting blogs that were not in DANO under a folder called 'no cache'.  IE6 could not locate the index.html file so it would always show what it had in the network server's cache file.  This of course wouldn't happen on home computers since the cache file on your computers automatically gets updated everytime you visit a website unless of course you tweeked IE6 differently.  So for those of you that are using Blogger for your blog please point to an index.html.  For those of you that are using PHP in your web servers, have the PHP script point to an index.html file.  For those of you that are lazy to create an index.html file in Blogger just recreate your template when your blog gets moved over to DANO.  For those of you that are dazed and confused with this current post, go back to bed and dream of golem and the butterflies...(_)_)

      This  is the  worst  summer in the last 5 years.  Its like every weekend the weather is cloudy and rainy.  I remember when I was a kid and whenever it rained and I wanted to play my mother taught me this rhyme:  "Rain rain go away come again some other day little Vincent wants to play!"  Well, most of the time it worked.

      Wow! I had no idea that DVD compressions were different for the DVD media that are out there.  I think the movie companies have their hands on the higher end compressions.  Like I always say, where there's a will there's a way.  If you cant save it to one dvd maybe theres a way to save it into two dvd's.  I've gotta research this...(pulling out the pad paper and pencil: note to self, find out how to hack 7GB dvds to compress it into a 4 GB dvd.)  In other events, I am assuming you people watched the EMMY's last night.  I of course again didnt win the vicarious "Best Stalking via the Comments Section" which was won by  urlLink Gnome-Girl .  I also didnt win the prestigious "Best Supporting Geek in a drama" category which was won by  urlLink Chris .  Oh lets not forget the new category that just came out this year, "Most Desperate Losers in need of Repros" which was unanimously received by a number of people coming into  urlLink Kinko's  all day today thinking they can get their last second projects completed in an hour.  If there's anyone out there that is in major need to watch some flix is me.  So yeah, I want those movie coupons.  Heres my  urlLink email .  How much are they?  Wow Jay, if you think April's Xanga page was all that, you should check out  urlLink Friendster  too.    And BTW I still cannot view the GROUP BLOG after I post and publish.  Oh well, I'll just post the  urlLink LINK HERE  for all to use when they post and publish

      Vince -- Congrats on the new toy!  I've had my DVD burner (came with my setup, also from Dell) for a while now but I've yet to rip any movies.  I've made some DVD Picture Shows (Ulead program) of our wedding pictures but that's about it.  The problem that I encounter when I try to copy DVDs (not that they want to make it easy because it certainly would be bad for business, I just wanted to try it for the sake of doing it) is that most DVDs are 7GB and the media that I have only has 4GB or so capacity.  When you figure out how to rip DVDs, please let me know!  April -- Haven't seen Lumpia but I will try to look for it.  I was just surprised to see The Debut in a mainstream video store (rather than an Asian/Filipino joint).  I heard about it from  Trinnah  but before that I didn't know what it was.  I was thrilled because it's the first movie ever made about our lives.  That's a milestone.  Yes, it's low-budget and had areas of improvement but as a first step it was amazing.  Brian actually enjoyed watching it (surprise). He laughed at some of the jokes that most non-pinoys wouldn't get.  Like when the two white friends were chowing down on Filipino food and this guy goes, "This stuff is really good!  Specially this CHOCOLATE meat stuff!"  Brian and I busted up laughing.  We assumed that he was referring to dinuguan, of course.  If he only knew!  Anyway, Brian said that the acting wasn't too bad.  Tirso Cruz III did a really great job playing the father role.  Brian said that the only bad acting in the movie came from (no offense Jay) the white actors.  I tend to agree with him but I explained that the GOOD white actors are expensive and with the movie being independent and low-budget and all, they couldn't afford to hire them.  GOOD Filipino actors on the other hand are cheap and easy to come by.  At any rate, the main character Ben is played by Dante Basco who incidentally also play Rufio in the movie Hook (with Robin Williams).  Brian (the movie buff that he is) recognized him almost instantly.  I doubted him at first.  It took half of the movie for me to realize it as well and finally agree.  I was so excited about the movie, I had to share it with my mom.  So we dropped it off on Sunday and then Brian will pick it up Wednesday so we can return the DVD on Thursday.  I love Hollywood videos!!  Mom wasted no time and watched the movie last night.  She loved it, too.   I think it's a great movie not just for Filipinos to watch but also other folks because it gives great insight into our culture.  Anyway, that's my bit about The Debut.  P.S.  Does anyone have a Loews Ciniplex in their area?  I have some movie coupons that I need to give away because they expire at the end of the year.  Email me your address if you want them!

      Whew! Its about time  urlLink The Debut   came out on DVD.  It's been touring the US for over 2 years now.  It came to NYC last year but I missed out in seeing it.  They decided that they will only release it in certain theaters out in Manhattan. Boooo! After much hooplah and long waits in line. I decided not to watch it in the movies thinking it was going to be out on DVD/VCD soon anyway.  I would like to see it on the big screen sometime.  Maybe they will offer to put it up for a viewing at the Consulate where they show artsy stuff sometimes.  And they show it for FREE!  I love free.  Dot and I splurged this week and bought a DELL Dimension with a DVD burner.  One thing one must put in mind when buying a DVD burner is the compatibility factor.  We went to Best Buys which had DVD media on sale.  The problem was that the media they had on sale wasnt compatible with our burner.   If you buy a DVD Rewritable.  The media you should get has to be a  DVD + R .  Any other version will not work.  However, you can still view DVDs that are already burned.  If you have a DVD Recorder you must look at the specs because there are several medias out there that cannot be mixed and matched for DVD recording.  Theres the DVD R, a DVD-R, and your DVD+R that I already talked about.  Needless to say, I ended up back at Best Buys yesterday to return my useless purchase.  Be on the look out for any deals for DVD+R media.  Dot is dying to try out our new toy...

       urlLink Random blog excerpt from masungit.net:    it's not the same . . : You know how I've said that there really is no point in trying to salvage a friendship where only one side is trying hard enough to salvage it? Well, I'm going through that again. It's just different now. I don't know if there's some hatred towards me, but it's just not the same. I wouldn't really care if we didn't hang out together so much. I guess I could try to distance myself, but we're from the same circle of friends. I don't want to confront her and ask her what her problem is with me because she's not really one of those people that can just say what she feels. She likes to beat around the bush. I know she has a problem with me -- I can see it with the way she talks to me, with the way she acts around me, with the way that she always somehow manages to exclude me from the "little groups" that are created everywhere we go. I could be just paranoid. I could just be thinking about it too much, but once again, I'm the one that it's happening to, so nobody can really understand how I feel when it happens. It's just weird. It's like junior high all over again. Back in the days when it was this other girl, me, and her. We would be hanging out at someone's house, and I'd be the odd one out . . like always. I'm getting really tired of it. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know what to say. I don't want to say anything. I guess I'll just do what I've been doing. When it happens, I'll just get quiet because like she said, "I don't let it get to me too much." I guess some things are just more important than others.    Some people think that it will stop.&nbsp; Like when I get to high school I won't have to deal with this crap.&nbsp; And when it happens in high school, we are hopeful that when we get to college we won't have to deal with this crap.&nbsp; And then when I get out in the real world, I won't have to deal with this crap.&nbsp; It's something that one will just have to accept because it's human nature and there is no way to change that.

      Thats great news JR.  and ditto for Ching and Brian!  My friend Yanni had her baby 4 days ago and they werent expecting her to give birth until 3 weeks from now.  As far as TechTV, I certainly hope that Ching and Brain are learning the ins and outs of the computer world.   Sad to say, I have stopped being an avid watcher of TechTV due to the fact that they booted  urlLink Chris Pirillo  from  urlLink his   urlLink show  and also the way the producers have slowly filled the network with crappy new shows rather than technology info in the last 8 months.  But dont let my boycott ruin your fun,  enjoy  urlLink Call for Help  and  urlLink The Screensavers  while you still can.

Lauren is 7lbs., 4 oz., so best guess is the docs were 6-7 weeks off in their calculations.  Mom and daughter are resting comfortably.  I'll try to get pics...

      Oh man! GOGO Yubari?  Shoot thats gonna be a difficult character to imitate.  Those marshal arts moves she made were quite extraordinary.  Now as far was the school girl uniform.  Then thats easy but if you want to really play the part you might wanna rent a half size ninja sword, a ball and chain, and i guess grow your hair long till it reaches your @55.  Good luck with the killer costume.  Take pictures while your at it.  I would like to see a Brian in a skirt dont get me wrong I am just curious.

      I was just perusing Ching and Brian's Blog.  I am loving that new SUV of yours.  Excellent choice!  My friends and I saw Kill Bill last Friday and it kicked @55!  Warning, violent scenes can give you an X rating so maybe thats why some scenes were in BW and oh for all you anime lovers out there this movie doesnt disappoint...

      The coworkers in my overnight shift have decided that they will be Pirates for Halloween.  I jokingly retorted at the idea and replied that they should act like pirates in the overnight too.  Arrgh, lassie what will you be picking up or placing an order?  Aye, there is no discount for color copies arrgh.  Yesh Maan, ju will have to walk the plank if you dont wanna pay for a cutting set up arrgh.  Then the parrot would reply: "Waaak, no discount! Waak!".  So what are you gonna be for Halloween?

       Thanksgiving et al  I had a number of things to be thankful for. One of which is that I get to spend it with Dorothy's Family this year. My Sister and Billy are busy working on their home improvements. Mom decided to spend it in New Jersey. And Joe has his thing this year. I got to go to Syosset with Dot and hang out with Jess and Em for a fun filled night of playing UNO until dinner was served. After a nosh dining on the wonderful menu, I ended up playing games on the X Box with Kim. Then came Black Friday. Dot woke me up and we drove to Best Buy for our early mornin shopping spree. Looked like others had the same MO. The doors were open but there was a HUGE crowd inside the store. Of course the Fuji cam I had my eyes on was sold out even before we got in the door. Allegedly they were handing out tickets for the camera when everyone was in line. Dot and I ended up with a couple of electronic items which I cannot disclose at this time for some of you might be getting these items. I can however disclose the 24" TV we managed to fit in the car. While we were waiting in line for 2 hours, there was this pile of boxes we were leaning against. It was a bunch of TV's that were on sale for 99.99! Needless to say, we took a box and dropped it in front of us since we didnt have a shopping card. It was poinless to have one anyway since you couldnt shop around the store with it. I am taking a break from shopping right now. But I do have one more thing to say before I go DVD X Copy is the SHIZNIT!

      I got some terrible news yesterday.  My grandmother's sister Laurie Palad passed away in her sleep Sunday.  It was found that she had a heart attack during her sleep.  In the last 8 years her life was plagued with a lot of hardship.  I am surprised she as persevered this long.  Lola Laurie's husband, Lolo Sammy passed away about 8 years ago.  Their estate in Cubao, Quezon City was split up between her and her daughter Joy and son Niels.  Tita Joy decided to sell her part of the property to someone and they put up an apartment building right in front of Lola Laurie's home.  Two years ago, Tito Niels, killed himself in an apparent suicide leaving his wife with 2 kids to feed and the rest of Lola Laurie's estate from Lolo Sammy.  We will be sending money to help pay for her burial since Tito Niels' money is still under litigation from his wife who doesnt want to give a single centavo for Lola Laurie.  I asked my mother if she had life insurance and mom says that it was all set up by Lolo Sammy and when he died it was split up between Niels and Joy.  Its all a big mess.  Please pray for her safe passage to heaven.  Of all the souls in purgatory that need a to go straight to heaven its Lola Laurie.  God bless her soul...

      I have only one site that I update at least once a week.  As if no one knows about  urlLink Kinkoman's Sauce .  I will have to rent that Love Actually flick.  I've giving my sensitive side a chance to watch chick movies lately.  By the way Ching, I have found this  program that makes a "back-up" copy of your DVD's.  Its called DVD X Copy Xpress.  I think  urlLink TheScreenSavers  did a review of it last month.  I downloaded a trial version and it does the job.  I have a copy of a DVD that I can pretty much do what I please.  Some bits had to be trimmed like the special features but the full movie is there and I guess thats what matters when you want digital quality movies.  I better stop this is starting this post is starting to become a Blog Zine report... Cheers!

      The following is  urlLink Tonino's , review of the  urlLink EXCALIBUR Hotel  in Las Vegas, Nevada.  He gave his opinion after he got back from his honeymoon and one of the excalibur's cleaning member stole his new  urlLink Nikes .  Read On...    The cleaning lady STOLE my new Nikes!!!! On my HONEYMOON.  Oct 24 '03  Author's Product Rating One Star  Pros NONE  Cons They ruined my honeymoon and did'nt fix the problem right then and there.  The Bottom Line Don't stay at this or any of there sister hotels cause the cleaning lady stole my shoes from a closed suitcase.   Full Review  I was there for 5 days and 4 nights for my Honeymoon. The first day was ok. The next day they "forgot" to give us new towels. The 3rd day they left the dresser dirty and aparently opened one of the drawers next to the bed cause it was left open. The 4th day they didn't vacuum the room. The last day the cleaning lady STOLE my sneakers from a closed luggage case. I'm sorry, they disappeared I guess. So I went off about how them going through my stuff ruined my honeymoon. They told me they had to investigate. BTW, the Sat cost $145 for the night. Now I wasn't paying for that. Also, Guest Relations is closed on Sat and Sun. WOW, that just blew my mind. The front desk was not helpful at all. Never did they appologize for my problems at THERE hotel.   Well, they "found" my sneakers 2 days later. Apparently they were "turned in" to Bell area. I guess they just walked themselves there....or the cleaning ladies son doesn't wear 9 1/2.   They told me they would look into my "request" to not pay for the Sat night. Yeah sure. They call me back and say my "request was denied". DENIED??? Well that was unacceptable. I ended up talking to the Guest Relations boss and he says they are going to reimburse me for one of my days. The other days cost $55 a night. I told him again that I wasn't paying for the $145 night cause that was the day it happened. He said he had to look into it and they would send back a check to me. Discover card was already called to dispute the charge until I get a check for $145 plus taxes. Amazing. I travel all over to FL, CA, GA, MN... and never had anything stolen. They should have fixed this problem when it started and I wouldn't be writing this letter today for the world to read. DON"T STAY AT THE EXCALIBUR, OR THERE SISTER HOTELS, LUXOR, MANDELAY BAY. They own others so look them up and don't stay at those either.   PS: If you would like to give your opinion do so at  urlLink this blog  or if you want further publicity you should voice it out at  urlLink epinions.com .

      My friend was given something similar his girlfriend gave him his own star.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I am talking about this girl gave him his own heavenly body,  A gaseous mass, a ball of white gobule, something he cant touch but see using certain coordinates.  Needless to say, they are no longer together.  Be fore-warned for such gifts like a blog just might lead to beakups, divorces, or estranged families.  Okay, I would give one to my brother's room-mate.  I hate her anyway.  But then again she might be ranting all night on it for me giving it to her.  Merry  urlLink Krispmas  to Everyone!

      Well, its official.  Chris Pirillo has spilled the beans about his separation from Gretchen.  It is a sad sad weekend for all Gnomies out there and the Geek world altogether.  I will surely miss the  silly videos Chris makes of his wife.  I have been talking to people close to Gretchen and Chris.  Heres an excerpt of what one of them is saying: "I'm not sure where the word is getting around about Chris and Gretchen, but it really is their personal life, and I hope people are respecting that. For the record, I have known about it for many months, only because Gretchen is a good friend of mine and she chose to talk to me about it. I hope the rumors aren't spreading too far... it concerns me."  And as for me, I am deeply saddened that there is one less geek with out  a model for a companion.  Sigh.  Okay now on with the holiday cheer.  Happy Hannukah!  From now  until Wednesday there will be Eight Days of the Festival of Lights!  Cheers!

       Tale of Two Movies  Weird coincidence - I own these two movies, but hadn't seen 1967's The Graduate in 30 years, and had only seen 1973's Heavy Traffic once, when I bought it a couple of years (?) ago.  But it turns out Heavy Traffic is sort of a parallel movie to The Graduate:  Same theme song plays throughout - Scarborough Fair (TG plays Simon and Garfunkel version, HT plays Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66); Both lead characters are young college-aged men; Both leads are accused of being virgins, and go to great legths to prove they're not;  Both leads are accused by their parents of drifting aimlessly and doing nothing with their lives; and Both movies were Rated "X" when they came out - TG later got an "R".  The big contrast is the environment - TG is upper crust and mannered, HT is low rent, crude, and violent.  HT's low budget shows, too - only name I recognized besides animator Bakshi was Jamie Farr (TV M*A*S*H's Klinger) - no clue as to which role he played.  It's now distributed by Orion, but was first released by the infamous American International studio - the definitive lowbrow source for lousy drive-in fare.  The parallels are subtle enough that I wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't watched them the same weekend, and even then, I didn't catch it til both movies were over, despite the repeated hearing of Scarborough Fair...

      I stay the hell out of stores Thanksgiving weekend.  I HATE crowds.  Hate em.  Took the granddaughter (Alyssa, 2) out to Kalamazoo (4 1/2 hr drive) to see Great-Grandma (my mom) Friday.  Just the three of us, had a great time.  Funny, Little Girl must have realized that none of the people she could manipulate with tears and tantrums (i.e., Mommy and Grandma) were around - behaved herself beautifully all day.

      PDA's are everywhere these days.  But how many of us utilize its capabilities beyond the things to do, the date book, or the optional camera attachment?  I myself own a Palm III which was handed down to me when Dot's cousin no longer had a use for it.  I tucked away my good old paper filled Filofax midway in June of 2002 and never looked back to it unless my PDA ran out of batteries and I had to re enter all my phone contacts.  When we upgraded to a new computer I installed the back up data into it.  I was reading  urlLink Meryl's column  in  urlLink Lockergnome  and it got me to thinking about the other things that I could do if I ever upgraded.  These days  urlLink Palm's  plethora of PDA's (try saying that a dozen times) can do lots more.  Camera, Phone, Internet, Email.  Then I got to thinking, will I ever get to use these services when I upgrade?  I barely use anything else in my Palm III besides the usual datebook and things to do.  Okay, so maybe Ill upgrade if blogger.com will let me blog it via email. Maybe, I can send Jaba a memo on why we need a new laminating machine.  Maybe, I can send a pic to MM about how messy the store looks when I come in to work on Sunday morning.  Whatever the case may be, I think that we all take for granted what our electronic personal assistants can do and I believe for most of us we use our PDA's for show like those people that come into the store and they're talking up a storm on their cellular phones as they approach the front counter.  So, what do you use your PDA for?

      Tech Bounces Us  These days, no one can really brag about one's cell phone without mentioning what it's called by the manufacturer.  I myself own a NOKIA 8260.  Which is now out of date.  Its been replaced by the 8265.  The 3600 is the more popular upgrade.  It has an optional camera you can attach to it and it has a roundabout button set up much like the old Bell Telephones we used to have in the analog days.  From what Ching has posted she has mentioned that she owns a T300 which is made by Sony-Ericsson.  Not a bad phone in my opinion but none the less it is out of date and that P900 is looking better everyday until it will grow old as well and the Q100 will take over it...   With the technology constantly changing don't you wish we still had 2 cans with a string tied in between it?  Or if you upgraded, you would have had the two way walkie talkies from radio shack or walmart.  Mine was called the 2CW (2 Cans with Wires).  If you were good to me I would let you in my network and tie your string to my 2CW.  Then we all would camp out in grandma's back yard and chat all night.   When I was in the boyscouts, our brothers introduced us to Morse code which could conveniently be sent via walkie talkies or telegraphs that were connected with miles and miles of wiring.  We even had to learn the basic codes so that we could send secret taps in silence using eye winks and pass those silly science exams without the teacher finding out.  These days, Students still cheat and they use their highly expressionistic devices and "text" each other the answers.   Nowadays, more and more teachers request homework to be typewritten and sent via email or posted to a webserver like Blackboard.com.  Whatever happened to the usual hand written and hand given assignments?  Handwriting of children these days don't develop and we end up having teenagers and even adults that have sloppy handwriting.  In my field of business, I rely on the good handwriting.  If I interview a prospective team member.  I make sure they write legibly otherwise I don't even bother with a second interview.  If one handwriting is hard to read.  How am I suppose to understand those damn chicken scratches on the order forms.   Last summer, the entire northeast was blacked out due to an electrical malfunction.  All the network phones didn't work because the electricity was out.  I had a back up analog phone and placed it in our fax jack and voila we had a phone to communicate with.   Lately, we have had a series of viruses infiltrating our networks and slowing down the internet.  How can you possibly send a digital file for printing?  Burning it to a CD or hand delivering a print on paper.   We have come to rely on technology to help us run our world.  We have also progressed and created new technologies that hackers and viruses have plagued and brought us back to the 80's.  Lets not make them win.  Always have a back up plan and when the lights go out again.  Remember, you can always tap on the can with the wires attached and communicate your thoughts or better yet write it on paper and send it to someone.    NET

       urlLink BUZZNET   Wow! Ching I had no idea that you didnt know about BUZZNET.  I was actually just testing out the reliability of this service.  So far its a MOBLOG server that is not only reliable, but it is ingenius and versatile.  You can actually post a lot of pictures without paying for the service although membership does have its privileges...  I'll post more about it on another post.  I've been so busy with work and with life that I have yet post an official review of it.  In the mean time, you can peruse my Buzznet by  urlLink CLICKING HERE   PS:  I would like to contribute to your fundraising goal.  Email me okay?

      Filters On!   In the last onslaught of worms and virus attachments,  our email server at work has been given an upgrade.  If you use netscape communicator or outlook express as your default email client, I would suggest that you guys create filters to delete repeated subject headings to further slow down this dreaded disease that is floating all over the internet and in all email servers.    ie.  If you get a frequent subject headings like "RE: Hi", "RE: Mailer Daemon", or the ever popular "Re: Hello"  Just a little P.S.A. ordered just to make your email and internet surfing a little more enjoyable instead of waiting due to lag time - most especially those who still use dial-up.  Cheers!

      MailerDaemon is the Devil!  Actually, to clarify your email troubles Ching,  I will have to ask you  if you are experiencing this trouble on your work email or your internet providers service?  If its from your email at work, just ignore it and do not at all cost download the attachment that was sent with the md message.  There are several versions of a certain worm that is plaguing email servers that just pulls out random email addresses and sends them msgs or sends out messages that were suppose to be from you but are not necessarily true.  Its already taken over our server which took about a weekend to resolve.  Four weeks ago we could not provide our customers our email addy to send files to because of these worms and viruses.    Recommendations: 1) Create an email filter on your IMAP or POP set up to ignore and delete all messages that has mailerdaemon on it until such mail stops coming to you.( About 3 or 4 days). 2) Make sure that you have the most recent update to your Antivirus software. 3)  Dont download any email attachments. Not even those jpg from your winter vacation. 4) Optional:  Eat some cheese sticks and hold the mayo.  As far as streaming video through the router.  Try configuring the router to have an open port available for the steaming video to come out to the internet.  Actually you might not want to anyway because the cable company or your internet provider might start charging you more money for using up more bandwith than what you're allowed to have under normal situations.

      Disregard the prev msg.. We cannot get streaming video to work bec of our router. We can see it fine on his computer and mine but anyone outside our network is SOL and that is just bunk!  BTW, Net -- speaking of worms and viruses.. I keep getting mailerdaemon msgs telling me that my message could not be sent to all of these people and I don't recognize any of the email addresses.. What does that mean?

      Check it out!  I now have streaming video on my web site. This calls for celiberation. I will soon be redesigning my web site to incorperate this into my page. If you want to see me in action, just click on the webcam link above. I will never turn my camera off again. Oh, one more thing.

      Late Breaking News:   urlLink Just picked this up from The Laporte Report: "G4 has fired the entire staff of TechTV".   They have been given the official 60 day notice for plant closing.  The studios in San Francisco will be closing and 100 of the existing jobs will be posted for staffers that are willing to relocate to LA.  My hope is that  urlLink Mr. Pirillo  has been keeping an eye on this news flash and is filling in for a position in L.A. right at this moment.  Sigh, one can only hope.

      Sorry about the mixup.. My Gmail is under cherrie.brubaker - I forgot. I just checked it again today.. And I found 1 email in there from Gmail mgmt on 4/27.  I had sent them an email asking about an import/export contacts feature on 4/24 and they replied on 4/27 so that's pretty fast response time.  Here is their reply:   Hello Cherrie,  Thank you for your message.  We are currently working on many new features to improve the Gmail service. Some upcoming features we are excited to announce are the following:  - Automatic forwarding of your email to another account - Plain HTML version of Gmail - Import/export Contacts  We hope you enjoy Google's approach to email.  Sincerely,  The Gmail Team

       If you have been viewing my  urlLink buzznet  lately, you may have discovered some published photos of Evelyn my half sister who is currently in the Philippines.  Its a little off topic for this blog but I really need to put some thoughts about it here.  If you ever read my previous blogs in  urlLink RadioLand , you may have come across some postings about her.   For the past 14 years, Evy has been the topic of conversation amongs us half siblings of her.  Last March, my brother Adolph went to PI for vacation and our father finally lets out the secret half sibling of ours.  She is such a cutey patootey!  I am still shocked at the fact that I do have a sister that I havent met yet.  I would certainly hope that she will accept us as her long lost siblings too.  Our Dad has led a somewhat mysterious private life after we moved out here to the US.  Now much rumors has been heard about Evy, and I am relieved that she has finally appeared in pictures.   Yesterday, my sister, my brother and I had lunch with our mother and she revealed yet another rumor about a half brother that might be lurking out there.  According to Mom, we have a half brother who was born a year after my sister Marie was born.  Alledgedly, it is reported that our half brother is now living in Thailand somewhere. Its amazing what secrets my family holds from all of us.  I am glad that one secret is out there to be told and resolved.  So what secrets does your family hold?.

      Hi y'all!  I just had a dental cleaning last thursday.  I must say that my dentist was very thorough especially when he was told that I have never been to a dentist in over eight years!  His assistant took x-rays of my molars and also a 360 degree x-ray of all my teeth.  I must say that a lot of technology has overtaken the dental industry.  I could have never imagined how technolgy could invade such a profession, but it has.    I was amazed about the data transfer capabilities of my dentist.  He has another assistant at the front who took all my information and placed it on the computer database.  This database was shared thru out the entire office via ethernet cables and my dentist accessed it on the network like a snap of a finger (well, he really did his fingers do the walking by typing it on a keyboard).  The next technology?  X-ray of course!  His assistant took xrays of my teeth and automatically was data transferred to my files.  All my dentist had to do was pull up my xray folder and voila! On the computer screen were my molars with little rectangles which were my fillings!    Its too bad that the dentist could not automate the cleaning process.  Still had to drill and pick and use that suction/vaccuum system to work on my teeth.  Result? After over 8 long years, I have great looking teeth sans the yellowing from occasional smoking.  See you in six months doc...
