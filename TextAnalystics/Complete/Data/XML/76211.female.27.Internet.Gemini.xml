       I watched my first  urlLink Search For a Supermodel  show tonight. It was the final one. I had mixed feelings about this. For those who don't know, it's this competition where Australian girls (And they really were girls, not women, many were 14-15) compete to be the Australian Supermodel of the Year by Katie Ford. The winner goes on to compete globally. I have nothing against the girls. They were all very pretty and beautiful and seemed very nice and supportive of each other but the whole thing just rubs me the wrong way. I think one of the designers said "A model's job is to make people happy." Now, I could launch into my whole preachy thing on how no one can really make us happy ---we're all responsible for our own happiness. Granted, there are people that we get along with very well who are easier to be happy with/around, etc. But in the end, no one can make us happy or unhappy unless we let them. Okay, so much for me not being preachy. ;)  There are lots of entertainers in the world. Musicians play music, artists make things, clowns do funny things, etc....models entertain by.....looking good? Now, I'll be the first to admit that I could never be a model by anyone's standards, so this isn't some "ugly girl pissed off at the world" rant. I just can't imagine what it would be like to be Katie Ford. Think about it. Her job is to judge people by the most superficial traits they have. How twisted is that? I know, I know, it's an "industry" and a "business" but I still think it's creepy. I was so annoyed at hearing her and everyone else spitting out garbage like, "You CANNOT be shorter than 5.9,''  "You CANNOT have really short hair," "You CANNOT have stretch marks," "You CANNOT have a fat ass" etc. etc. And the reason why you "can't be" a lot of these things is because you "won't fit designers' clothes."  Well, geez. Why don't designers just make clothes for normal sized people? It's ridiculous because fads come and go and styles come and go, and society could learn to tolerate short people and people with bigger butts, and people who are larger than a Barbie doll, as normal people, attractive people.   And we all know that airbrushing erases stretchmarks.  I guess I just don't like the idea of defining what is attractive because girls/women who are into the modelling thing take it very seriously. Defining a "standard" of attractiveness is weird to me. I understand that there are certain things that perhaps the majority of the population go for, but it's freaking 2001. I'm much more into "to each his/her own," "we all come in different shapes/sizes" thing. We're all attracted to different things. I guess I'm just tired of the stupid cookie-cutter crap. Anyhoo I just hope none of the contestants goes home feeling worthless because Katie told her she was too short or her hair wasn't long enough.   'Nite! :)

       What a sleepy day today was. Warmish but rainy on and off all day. At any given point, I could have laid down on any surface (desk, floor, boardroom table) and curled up into the fetal position and taken a nice nap. I had two cups of hot chocolate today. It was just that kind of day. Okay, enough boring weather talk, but I'm a big believer of the weather affecting how energetic/upbeat I am, so it's boringly relevant.  The good news is I am officially signed up for this writing "retreat" this weekend and I'm signed up for a meditation workshop the following weekend. Next weekend we are celebrating Thanksgiving early because Jorge is going on holiday to New Zealand.  I'll be contributing my "famous" mashed potatoes for the second year running.  What's funny is that I took a cab back from George St because I took longer than I thought while paying for my class and the taxi driver remembered me! I did not remember him, but he said he remembered my face and finally asked if I lived on City Rd. How funny. Thank goodness he wasn't the cab driver I had a few weeks ago, who was pushing 40 and asked me for my number so he could ask me out on a date some time. Poor guy.   And I got tix for myself and two friends for next Wednesday to see John Butler Trio so that's set.Yay!  I can't believe I neglected to tell my lowly Melbourne Day Cup story yesterday---I sorta got into it and then forgot about it. It'll have to wait till tomorrow as I'm just ready to pass out into a deep sleep.   I can't get "Amazing" by Alex Lloyd out of my head:  "You were amazing We did amazing things I wouldn't change it We were amazing things..."  Simple, but it gets me every time.  Work was it's usual busy self today, and a client told me I was "The Saviour." I'm thinking of putting that on my resume....

       Okay, so I'm back and blogging again, kinda. This template I'm using is temporary, until I actually have time to do something to repair the damage I did tonight. ;)  Today was Melbourne Cup day, or as one  urlLink cool chick  likes to call it, "The Race That Stops A Nation." For those non-Aussies, reading, it's a big ol' horse race. It's also just another great reason to piss off to the pub for the arvo, and the incredible ability of finding excuses to stop working to go to the pub is just one of the many reasons why I respect Australians. (*Notice my use of the phrase "Piss off to the pub for the arvo" - that means, "Shrug off work to go to a bar for the afternoon" for all those  urlLink Springfieldians  out there.) Unfortunately I cannot pull off such a phrase as well verbally. I type it much better than I can say it. But I'm working on it.   So how the hell do I catch up? Way too much to cover...let's see... Went to see  Legally Blonde  last week. It was hilarious. Fun, easy, cute little movie. Reese Witherspoon is just adorable, and I did think of you, Kristen. ;)  I've seen some great gigs lately, including the infamous  urlLink ESN , whom I'll always love even though their bass player/singer sent me a nasty computer virus (by accident) ;) I also urge people to go see up&comers, QuarterAcre, who have no website yet, but they've had some great shows lately. I expect good things from them in the near future. And you really should get along to see  urlLink The Drugs  for a hilarious night. And if you're up at 4am, watching Rage, you might see me. I am an extra in "Pam & Sam" and I've had several people tell me they saw me in the video, and I never warned them I was in it. I'm wearing a leopard print tank top and I'm head-banging in the mosh pit, so look for my hair. ;) I just recently saw the video for the first time and I look about 12, but oh well. I was never afraid to look like a dork for friends' sakes ;) And, of course, get yourself to see  urlLink Faker  while you're at it. These guys have some catchy songs that will stay in your head for ages.  I'm excited because tomorrow I'm going to be signing up for a little "writing retreat" for this weekend. I'll still be in Sydney, but I'll be spending 9am-5pm on Saturday and Sunday writing my butt off, I hope. They're going to cover all sorts of things, including how to get over procrastination, avoidance, and writer's block, and they'll be teaching helpful Buddhists' philosophies for writers. I'm looking forward to it. Only bummer is I'll miss a good portion of the Newtown Festival, but no pain, no gain!  Then the following weekend, I'll be taking a meditation seminar. I know, I sound like I'm turning into some sort of new agey freak, but I'm into trying different things at the moment. I've done the Tai Chi, which I loved, and want to continue with sometime soon, and now I'm eager to give meditation a whirl. My mind races non-stop, I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about things I have to do the next day, it's all a bit silly, really. I have my own relaxation techniques, but it can't hurt to learn some more tricks that have been used thousands of years. I suppose I'll have to sign up for Yoga next, just to keep up with my touchy feely spiritual self. Oprah would be so proud. ;)  Also going to run down to  urlLink The Metro  tomorrow to grab some tix for the  urlLink John Butler Trio  show next Wednesday. Friday night has sold out, so I wanna get in quick. They were amazing last time I saw them (June and then John solo in July) so I'm verrrrrrrrry excited. Last time I saw 'em I wanted to go home and really play my guitar until my fingers bled, so I'm hoping this show will have the same effect.   I guess my other big news is that I have a new "pseudo-stalker."  Most (i.e. none) of my friends will be particularly surprised by this. I attract weirdos all the time. But this guy is quite the character. Unfortunately he's grown annoying lately by ringing me at work and mailing me items that indicate he just has way too much free time on his hands. In any case, one good thing has come out of this. I have a new idea for a script based on his antics, so that's something. I can find inspiration in the unlikeliest of places.   Sweet dreams!

       I have a new  urlLink messageboard  and a new  urlLink guestbook . As they are about 5 minutes old, there are only some boring messages from me, myself, and I. If you want to take pity on me, say hi! ;)

       The John Butler Trio concert was *bleeping* amazing! I was blown away for the 3rd time this year...absolutely hardcore musicians. The music was so intense, I was balancing dancing with the inability to move because of being entranced by the playing...

       It will probably be the weekend before I catch up! Grrrrr! :)  Worked late again tonight after vowing to leave at a reasonable hour. Silly me. Anyhoo, am going to do my daily writing exercise shortly, so this will be quick. Just want to send out my condolences to the victims/families of the latest plane crash in New York. It must be extra freaky for poor little New Yorkers since all that's happened in the last couple months. :(  Going to see John Butler Trio tomorrow night ! Woo-hoo! Verrry excited about that!  Sweet dreams!

       I will go back and fill in the last few days later, but even though my weekend got off to a rough start (i.e. Friday night was hellish), this turned out to be the most fun weekend I've had in probably a year. This weekend I learned so much and met some of the coolest people of all time and I had some of the best conversations and I did a lot of writing....funny how it was the best weekend in ages, yet I didn't get to sleep in at all ;) More coming soon!

       I forgot to write yesterday that one of my bosses had an excellent idea. He told me he thinks I should become a child actor. Hahahahahaha....can you imagine me telling my family? "Hi, Mom and Dad, I'm all grown up now, so I've decided to become a child actor!" :) This came out of a conversation we were having that was inspired by Alient Ant Farm's rendition of "Smooth Criminal." Of course it made me think of Michael Jackson and how I think it's such a shame that now when people think of him, they associate him with child molestation etc. I told my boss how I was in love with Michael Jackson when I was about 8. I thought I was going to marry him. Of course when I was 9 I was going to marry Jon Bon Jovi. And I wanted to marry the Karate Kid (Ralph Macchio) around then as well....not to mention Patrick Swayze and Joey Tempest (remember the band Europe?) Needless to say, my tastes were pretty loose.  Anyhoo, we got to talking about The Karate Kid and I mentioned that I read somewhere that Ralph Macchio was like 35 when he did that movie (okay probably more like 24, but he looked about 14, so you see where I'm going with this. (Wait, I just realised....I think Patrick Swayze was 35 when he did Dirty Dancing, my bad.) So the fact that Ralph (Daniel) was about 24 or older and looking like he was 14 and playing a kid in highschool. So this inspired my boss to suggest that I become a child actor since I look so young...  Something to think about, definitely ;)

       No time to write tonight, I worked late, so I'm buggy-eyed. Just one bit of advice: Never use Dove Body Wash as shampoo when you run out of real shampoo. This morning I was in the shower, just got my hair all wet when I realised I was totally out of shampoo. Once before, maybe 8 months ago, the same thing happened so I used Herbal Essences body wash as shampoo because I was desperate. That actually worked pretty well. However, stupid me went and used Dove  Moisturising  Body Wash, which I absolutely love because it does make my skin all super silky soft. However, I was basically shampooing like 75% moisturiser into my super-fine long hair. It weighed my hair down - I looked like cousin IT after a day at the beach, with sunscreen in my hair or something. Of course I'm sure no one else noticed it but me but that's because I work with all boys ;)  Anyhoo, a word to the wise... :)  p.s. I never thought I'd stoop so low as to write a blog about a "bad hair day!" ;)

       I had a yummy dinner with J and R tonight at a cute little classy restaurant on Elizabeth St. I had the barramundi on a bed of angel hair pasta and zucchini. MMM-MMM-GOOD! I am pathetic, I had  one  glass of wine with dinner and now I'm zonked. We were celebrating Thanksgiving early tonight and we all realised we have a  lot  to be thankful for. I'm mostly thankful for my family, friends, everyone's health,  the fantastic opportunities I've been given this past year, and the amazing new people I've met over the last two years. It's hard sometimes having the people you love being spread out all over the world, over several continents, but then again, it can be pretty cool too.   This is just a quickie, I'm off to bed - early meeting with a client in the morning - woo-hoo!  One last thing, you know how annoying it is when you get a song in your head and you just can't get rid of it? Well, I have had one of my own songs stuck in my head non-stop for like the last month...trust me, there's nothing more annoying than being tortured by your own stuff! ;)

       I am burning chocolate scented incense in my bedroom right now. Smells divine. Today was the 3rd consecutively rainy day in good ol' Sydney. Super windy and pretty chilly and I hate being a boring person who only talks about the weather so I'll shut up now...  Went out to lunch with my co-workers for Yumcha today. Yum! Very nice! We were celebrating the brief return of an old co-worker and the amazing silence in the office today and it was well worth celebrating. Thank you to D for being so nice about letting me sit on his lap to and from Chinatown. Six of us were packed in a small but cool little car. It was like clowns getting out of one of those little cars...where they just keep getting out and you wonder how many are in there ;)  Looking forward to an early Thanksgiving dinner with J & R tomorrow.....won't be the same without my mashed potatoes, but we'll survive. ;)  I am very excited that miss Kristen will be arriving in Sydney soon. We are going to have a ball, my dear, you can bet on it. Things might be looking shady at the moment, but you just get ready to have the time of your life. Madame Butterfly will see to that!  And special get-well wishes go out to Rammstein. May you feel all better soon and enjoy fun halluincatory Vicks-induced dreams in the meantime :)

       I felt a bit nauseous this evening - I think it was the damn coffee I had this afternoon. And for the nth time, I think I might give up coffee :) I am actually really craving vegemite toast at the moment - am definitely having it for breakfast tomorrow. For some of you, this will sound quite ordinary, but trust me, for an American to be  craving  vegemite toast, well, it is a special moment ;)  More gale force winds today, power outages, houses damaged, people hurt, craziness! Thankfully my experiences were pretty tame in comparison.  The ladies room in my office is freezing beause the windows can't ever close- they just bang open and bang shut over and over and over again. It's like going to the bathroom outside. Anyhoo, today a leaf and a twig came flying through the window and hit me in the face while I was on the can, and then the extra roll of toilet paper went all over the place when the wind blew it off the window sill.   Only 9 more days until  urlLink Harry Potter  opens...normally I really hate things that are this popular. It's usually a huge turn-off, but they're extremely entertaining and fun books, what can I say? I'm hooked, it's true. And to think just 12 months ago I was on the train snickering at businessmen on the train reading Harry Potter or businesswomen in their powersuits, riding on their scooters while reading Harry Potter. Granted, they can still be laughed at, but for other reasons... ;)  Time for some writing now....*whip cracking*

       I am soooo sleepy. I just got home. It's about 7.30pm and I have been out and about since 8.30am. I had a 9am-5pm  urlLink meditation  seminar today. It was really tough, but good. My mind is always racing so learning to "turn it off" for a while was extremely difficult. It will take lots of practice to really get it going, but I was pretty proud of myself, I turned off the thoughts more than I would have thought I could, for periods of time at least.   Our teacher was pretty funny. He's one of those guys that's walking a fine line with me between sincerity, common sense, wisdom, and philosophy and BS. I agreed with a lot of what he said, and I disagreed with quite a bit here and there, but could totally understand where he was coming from even when I didn't agree. And that's what it's all about, isn't it? I mean, some things I was experiencing for the first time, or hearing for the first time, so it was like taking a sip of lemonade and swallowing the sweet bits I liked and spitting out the bits I didn't like (the seeds).   So, it was a good day, albeit a long one. My co-workers on Friday were like, "Can you last that long without talking?" and I dared them to take bets on me. Even though everyone who knows me says I could "talk underwater" I have realised that I don't really talk much on Sundays. Sundays are usually my quiet days. I think I have gone some Sundays without speaking to anyone! (Pick yourselves up off the floor, those of you who have fainted.) I probably have a nightime chat with friends every now and then on Sundays, but usually that's my day of writing/reading/lounging around, with just me, myself, and I.   I only spoke to people today during the two tea breaks. During lunch we were asked to go eat alone and do this special meditation while eating and do a walking meditation through  urlLink Hyde Park  ( urlLink Virtual Tour ). Before lunch we did a laying-down meditation. That was pretty cool. We all laid down on the floor, our heads all pointing towards the middle of the circle, the lights were out, just a candle an some incense burning. Very relaxing. After lunch we learned about  urlLink Zen  meditation and did it for about 45 minutes. It was so strange. I actually did it pretty well towards the beginning and had this incredible urge to giggle and laugh. I felt giddy. And I kinda felt buzzed and "high" even though I've never done drugs before and have no idea what it's like to feel high due to them. But I do know what it feels to be high naturally... urlLink sky-diving  does that. So it kinda felt like that on a smaller scale. It was pretty cool. But then the thoughts started to invade again and every now and then I'd feel like I just couldn't take it anymore, and I had that antsy  "Is it over yet?" feeling, and then I'd chill out again and go with it and it was good. The class next door was talking about culture shock and it was really hard not to let that get into my brain. That whole mantra thing (I said "Kuuuuuu" instead of "Ooooohmmm") does actually help block out everything else.   Our teacher today gave me a lot to think about. It's not as if I hadn't thought of some of these things before, but it was a good reminder. He talked a lot about a good diet and did the whole "you shouldn't eat red meat...it is in the nature of human beings to be  urlLink vegetarians " thing and he brought up the same points that several authors I've enjoyed have pointed out. Human beings have to cook their meat a LOT and season it and do all sorts of things to hide the meat because it wouldn't naturally taste good to us etc etc. And there are a lot of other valid points too. Now this doesn't mean I'm going to become a vegetarian, but I have noticed that I have become more vegetarian over the last two years. I still eat meat, but not as often as I used to, and I definitely eat a lot less red meat than I used to. Some days I could really go for a good juicy prime rib, but I guess the point is finding moderation. A little bit of anything is fine. When he got into the "eat more fresh foods" spiel, I started thinking that I have been eating too much crap lately and too much soda. So I'm not giving up my junk food or soda cold turkey, but I'm just going to try to eat healthier/better foods and keep the junk to a minimum.  So that's more water, less Coke :) I ate pretty healthy today, so we'll see how long it lasts.  The teacher also slagged " urlLink psychology " quite a bit and I found it very amusing. He was right about some things. I will be the first to admit that there are a lot of dodgy things involved in psychology and plenty of crap is being thrown around, but he sounded a bit disillusioned to me. Psychology is like any other field or area of study. There's good stuff and bad stuff and it's up to individuals to pick and choose between what they agree with, and what they don't, and you always have to be careful to keep an open mind.    The main thing that I found a bit disconcerting is how he kept talking about "your people" and "my people" etc. etc. He kept making that distinction. When I looked around the room at the other "white people" I wasn't thinking, "These are my people!"  I know he was really just making the distinction between western culture/philosophy and eastern culture/philosophy, and that's very relevant, but every time he said, "Your people often like this" or kept using the collective "you," it just felt weird. He was born in part of Persia which is now Iran, but he's been in Australia for 20 years now. He had a great smile and was quite the character. I think more than anything, he just reconfirmed my belief that there are admirable qualities in eastern philosophies and western philosophies and it's good to sift through them and choose what you like to try to find that balance in everything you do.   I have been extra extra tired these last 2 weeks regardless of the amount of " urlLink sleep " I've been getting, mostly because the quality of my sleep has been quite poor. So many dreams, lots of shallow sleep. I wake up completely drained. I think it's one part "not enough relaxation" and one part "not enough exercise." I live right across the street from an amazing pool. Ideally I'd like to go swimming for maybe 45 minutes before work, perhaps 3x a week? If I woke up at 6.30, I could fit it in. In my dream world, I'd do 45 minutes of either swimming or  urlLink Tai Chi  in the mornings, then take a shower, then do 25 minutes zen meditation, then eat breakfast, then power-walk to work while doing the walking meditation. Then, after work, I'd do the walking meditation on my way home, come home, do the zen meditation, eat dinner, do my writing for a while, read, then do a bit of Tai Chi, and then finally, the laying-down meditation....it's supposed to give you deep  urlLink dreamless  sleep. I know, I sound absolutely insane! But I think all of that would give me lots more energy and that's what I want!  I should really start taking some more Tai Chi classes--I'm really into the relaxation/exercise combo. Anything that gives you a work-out and clears your mind at the same time is SO my  urlLink bag , baby. Seriously, after my 2 months of Tai Chi, I could really notice the difference. It was very relaxing, and my thigh muscles were strong. I have slacked off in the last couple months and my body is consequently slack as all hell, so time to to start it up again! I'm really in this whole "try new things, see if they're any good, have an open mind" sort of mode, as I think you can tell.  Today was a weird day weather wise. Rainy and crappy (yet warm) this morning, then the sun came out and it was beautiful. Then no idea what happened between 9am-1pm, it was okay during lunchtime, then started raining again, yadda. I went to Broadway to read/write for a couple hours after class (after 5pm) and when I was heading outside the sunny weather changed to rain immediately. I nearly pulled a  urlLink Mary Poppins  as the wind was ripping up and my umbrella kept blowing inside out, but as I was crossing Broadway I saw a rainbow. It was gorgeous. Half of it was coming out of Broadway Shopping Centre and the other half was coming out of the Telstra building. (At least from my perspective.)    Off to do some writing now. Woo-hoo.

       Cannot believe it's December!   Well, here's the scoop:  urlLink Kristen  has arrived! Woo-hoo! It's so good to see her again and we're going to have a blast while she's here. Of course with her luck and mine (crazy luck) there are bound to be lots of bizarre funny things/stories happening.  Last night I was fun, I was treated to heaps of delicious food at Club Tatts in downtown Sydney. Very classy place, I was there with two co-workers etc. and it was just food heaven. Had some mushroom ravioli appetiser (yum!) , chargrilled beef with onion marmalade for the main, and plum pudding and ice cream for dessert. They kept coming around with wine, refilling everyone's glasses, so I was ready to fall asleep after the first one ;)  Thursday night I asked Kristen if there was anywhere special she wanted to go for dinner and get this - she said Otto's! How funny is that? I was so excited because I'd been craving that damn pizza all day at work and wanted to go and get it again, even if it was the next day. So we went and it was heaven, I tell you. I made Kristen try a bite and she was  not  impressed to say the least, and officially thinks I have weird taste in food, and she's probably right ;) But that's me, lovin' the weird stuff. Anyway, the pizza was huge, I looked at it thinking, "Right, so I'll have to take half of this home with me." But that was not to be, ladies and gentlemen, I ate the whole thing! I was stunned. Kristen was stunned. It was the first time in ages a waitress has ever taken a plate away from me without feeling obligated to ask if I was done. I should have grabbed the plate and said, "Hey, I haven't licked the crumbs yet, Missy! Back off!" Anyway, usually I talk too much during dinner and I'm a super slow eater, so I was quite proud of myself for polishing it all off. If only I'd had a camera ;)

       Tonight was a night of comedy and pizza. I went to see the  urlLink Puppetry of the Penis  show at the Footbridge Theatre. Now now, I can hear my relatives freaking out from the other side of the world, but rest assured, this is a comedy show. Granted, you'd all still freak out if you ever saw it, but it was quite funny. I won't elaborate here, if you're curious, click on the link. So it was hilarious, even though I've seen it before - last year. I enjoyed it just as much this time around, and the support act was great too! I wish I could remember her name, but she rocked.  After the show we went to Otto's, one of my favourite Glebe cafes. I adore their chicken fajitas but Rammstein thought that the Tandoori Chicken pizza sounded good....to be continued....

       One thing I will never get over: The cleaning ability of Sprite. I'm sure club soda would work just as well, but I never have that lying about. But yeah, if you happen to spill dark juice or soda on your carpet because you or your friends are klutzes, just pour enough Sprite on the carpet to cover the entire stain. Let it soak in....then start to mop it up with a sponge and put a fan over the rug to assist in the drying. If you use enough Sprite, the stain should be either totally gone or at least 100x better than it was before. I'm about as un-Martha Stewart as they come, but at least I know one trick ;)

       Okay, I've just added little temperature/time clocks for both Sydney and Boston so everyone can keep track of the time difference and temperature difference. For those of you reading this from the U.S., Europe, Asia, or wherever you are, the current time is whatever it says on this page. I know the whole springing ahead, falling back thing has confused some people. Sydney is now 16 hours ahead of east coast U.S. and 19 hours ahead of west coast U.S. (weird, huh?) However, I might remove the Boston clock (or just stick it somewhere else) Because I think the two clocks look really annoying together on the same page! ;) I'm also thinking of perhaps trying to come up with a slightly less childish design for these clocks and sending it to the url that offers these time/weather thingies. They're a bit kiddish, but I really can't complain because it's such a nice free tool. Thanks to  urlLink wunderground.com  and to  urlLink geekbee.com , because I saw it there first.

       Holy cow it is a hot one today - would have been an excellent beach day had I not had work to do...maybe next weekend. It is 5.30pm and it's currently 32.7 degrees Celsius, which is nearly 91 degrees Farenheit. And when you're in direct sunlight - hot! hot! hot! I really can't complain as I'd rather sweat than be shivering, but my apartment temperature is fine and comfortable, just have the fan going on low. I have to go swimming on days like this - hope to start going to the pool across the street in the next couple weeks and Kristen will give me a good excuse to start going to the beach in general. We're going to do the walk from Bondi to Coogee, but I think we should start in the morning this time ;) Last year we started the walk around sunset, so of course that meant we were walking in total darkness. We couldn't see where we were going and at one point realised, "hey, we're walking through a cemetary!" What followed was about 2 hours of inching through the pitch blackness ("Are we there yet?") and being followed by a mysterious man playing the bagpipes in the bushes. Now, I'm a big fan of  urlLink Austin Powers , but I really didn't want to meet a "Fat Bastard" character in the middle of nowhere, at night, no less. Oh, those were the days! ;)  Okay, back to work for me, just had to do my weather upate. I keep saying how I won't be boring and comment on the weather, but I know my family actually likes to hear the weather comparison between here and the east coast of the U.S., so this is for you guys! ;)  The Glebe Street fair is happening today....excellent tribal music happening, I can still hear it from my apartment. I didn't stay too long and I refrained from buying things with butterflies on them. I am stunned by my willpower. It was very difficult to keep walking, but I did it ;)

       Just got home....2.30am, not bad at all. Early night! Saw a super show at the Hopetoun Hotel. Headlining were  urlLink Faker  who put on yet  another  super show. Consistently contagious, cool, and danceable rocking tunes. The second band was The Feelerss, who really rubbed me the right way. Excellent set from them, I'm going to have to buy their album....good stuff!  I finally got to see the one and only  urlLink Sir Milgram  and the lovely Madame S, and the cool South-American sounding Irish  urlLink Miss F  and I also got to see my semi-regular gigging crowd, Andrew and Angela. Went with A + A to a toga party in Marickville after the show, finally redeeming myself after turning down too many invites from Andrew. You haven't lived until you've been in a bathroom with Angela and Andrew, creating Andrew's party costume. I was highly impressed with Angela's sheet stylings and the team-work those two had when creating a laurel tiara for Andrew out of a coat hanger and tral leaves, it was something of beauty. I really didn't help much, I pretty much just laughed at the two of them. I danced my butt off for about an hour. There was some good music going and there was a nice dance floor happening. Then Angela and I did the mature thing and left early so we could actually get work done tomorrow. We left Andrew to party on in our absence. I still smell like Angela now - she gave me some of her perfume, it goes fairly nicely with my vanilla.  All in all a very good night, but 2 lowlights: 1. On my way to the show, I decided to take a cab. Needed to get money from the ATM, so I went to catch a cab at Broadway. Nothing makes me happier than when I am blatantly standing on the sidewalk trying to hail a cab when a group of ignorant people look at me, notice I'm trying to hail a cab, and then walk like 20 feet ahead of me and try to hail a cab in front of me. This happens to me all the time, and there's not a whole lot to do really. I can either give them a nasty look or just walk to another corner, but there's no sense in getting upset. I have a good karma thing going. When I am trying to hail a cab and I notice someone already there, I go up to them and ask if they're trying to hail one. If they say yes, I politely stand behind them and wait for them to get one. They were there first, so that's that.  I had no deadline tonight, so I wasn't particularly bothered by these kids. However, a miraculous thing happened tonight. After they kept looking over at me and snickering over how they were going to get a cab before me, they hailed a cab that looked like it was coming to them, and I hailed the one behind it. At the last second, their cab decided to blow them off and turn left and my cab sailed right by them and stopped in front of me. They were livid. Ha ha! Karma, baby, karma. So, this lowlight was actually a highlight.  2. Okay, this one really  is  a lowlight. I was up at the bar with  urlLink F , waiting to order a drink and noticed the girl next to me light up a cigarette. I jokingly said, "Hey, let me know if my hair catches fire, will ya?" cause she was being all haphazard with her cigarette. And we laughed. And we waited. And I smiled. I smiled right up until I felt this horrible burning sensation in my arm. The dork burned my arm with her cigarette. She noticed she did it and moved the cigarette away, but too little, too late, honey.  There's currently a bright red mark on my arm where it happened which I am hoping will fade away soon. Ah well, it's a dangerous world out there, folks. ;)  Sweet dreams!

        urlLink    Homebake...wow. It was a long but awesome day...John Butler Trio, Machine Gun Fellatio, Alex Lloyd, Something for Kate, Augie March, Eskimo Joe, Kasey Chambers, Skunkhour and more....tomorrow ;) Hopefully! Sorry, I have to go re-attach my feet. They just fell off ;) Up top is me playing in the kiddie fountain in which somebody dumped a lot of bubble mix in ;)  urlLink    The other pic of me and Gavin during Kasey Chambers' set. The music made me feel like riding a horse, so that's my horse-riding demonstration. That also explains why Gavin is pretending not to know me.

       Sorry for all the damn dots lately. I have been way too tired to write much recently. And I'm not going to do much better tonight - perhaps this Sunday I will actually catch up on the last week. For now I'll just give a minor update on last night's dinner. Gav is a legend for suggesting that dinner. It was TO DIE FOR. Red curry barrimundi. Holy cow, that was amazing. My taste buds were in heaven. Between the tandoori pizza last week and the barrimundi this week, my stomach has been very very very happy. Oh, for you guys in the U.S. , barrimundi is a white fish like haddock or scrod. My family would love the actual barrimundi, but hate the red curry. I am the freak spice lover in the family!  Anyway, Gav has challenged me to choose an even better place for dinner next time we go out, and I'm feeling pretty intimidated, but I did introduce him to  urlLink John Butler , so I've got that going for me!    urlLink Homebake  is happening on Saturday...it's going to be awesome, though difficult to choose between simultaneous acts...stay tuned!

        Seeing red again!   I'm not seeing red right now, but boy was I yesterday. It takes so much to get me angry, so when I do, it must be for something pretty good. Luckily I know how to settle myself down. Went out with Gavin last night to watch my friend Bonnie's band play. She was amazing! Never heard her sing before, so I was very impressed. It was all bluesy rock stuff which totally fit my mood. I'm thinking of writing my own blues song based around the events of late ;)  Anyhoo, I had like a four hour conversation with my parents today. That's what I get for going about 2 months without speaking to them! (Just kidding, you guys, it was great to catch up!) Anyway, I've vented and I feel more calm today and I'm just going to have to wait and see what the situation is like on Monday. Kristen and I are going out to my friend Jo's "mexican" Xmas party tonight. We're going to wear matching Santa hats, so we'll look appropriately silly. Just wanted to say big thank yous to Kristen, Jorge, Rammstein, Gavin, Clive, Jeremy and everyone else who's listened to me whinge and bitch this week. Usually I try not to bother  too   many people with stuff, but boy has it been good to vent.  And a huge thanks to my baby J in San Fran for writing me the sweetest message at the most appropriate time ;)   This has been an eye-opening week on many levels. It's amazing to find out who takes you for granted and who doesn't.  But for tonight, alll I'm going to do is go out and have a good time and meet new people. And have fun, dammit. I am proud to announce the return of my dignity and self-respect this week. Amen ;)

        We're online!    urlLink     Hallelujah! We finally got the damn digital camera to communicate with my stupid computer and the pics are going online! We have no idea why it worked this time. We've decided not to question the computer gods that be...This pic was taken at Chris' party a week and a half ago - (aside, today is Kristen's 2 week anniversary! Yay! My brain is totally not functioning and Kristen is sitting next to me and giving me sympathetic looks as I start to type something but can't remember what I wanted to type---working on like 3 hours of sleep here! All I have to say is, how cute is Kristen and how frigging big are my lips? ;)  urlLink Get the bigger version!  (Warning: Lips may appear larger in the rear view mirror!)   urlLink    Okay, I have no idea who the guy on the far left is, but he was really funny to talk to. Chris is the partyholder in the middle, and I'm the 14 year old looking 24 year old on the right. That's my butterfly in the shape of an american flag shirt. I'm not much of a stars and stripes wearer, but the american butterfly was too cute to ignore.  Cheers! Oooh, and I have to remember to write about yet another day of sharing cabs with strangers today. I actually made a profit. And yes, I take way too many cabs! We all know that cabbies account for a good 50% of the freaks I meet! :) p.s. Note to my family: No, I did not cut my hair short ish again, those bits hanging down the front are my short layers - if you look down past my elbow, that's my hair continuin all the way down my back to my waist. So what I am trying to say is, I still look like a hippie ;) |  urlLink  Enlarge photo  | E

         Seeing red...    It takes a lot to really get me angry, but angry I was today. I won't get into it here, but someone in my life was acting like a total tool today. I have been taken for granted for way too long and today this person went too far and I had to speak my mind. We all act like tools sometimes, but when a tool is a tool and pretends like he or she isn't a tool, he/she needs to be put in their place.   Today was a pretty emotional day for me in all sorts of way and on all sorts of levels that I cannot write here, as it's too personal. You'll just have to take my word for it.  As Sydney band "The Drugs" always say, "The only way is up..."  :)

       I've had insomnia for like a week now. Slept a bit last night - but that's a lot more sleep than I've gotten lately. Part of it is my darn allergy pills that keep me up all night, definitely, and the other part is that I just have a lot on my mind. Tomorrow is my office Christmas party, and here's hoping it all goes well. I just got the instructions for what's needed this afternoon, so I'm keeping my fingers and my toes crossed that I get it all done in time, with no hitches! The best part is, we have no idea how many people are coming! Like 150 were invited, and maybe 30 RSVPd. Should be exciting ;)  Last night Kristen and I watched an Oprah prime time special with Tom Cruise. Only Oprah and Tom Cruise could get on prime time these days. It's really interesting to see how many Australians hate Tom Cruise now because of "what he did to our Nic!" :) Newscasters only interview angry Australians who are offended that Tom dumped their little darling, so it's hard to gauge how many people are actually upset at Tommy boy. But I was watching the news the other night and lots of people were saying they'd boycott Vanilla Sky because Tom Cruise was in it---and he dissed Nic. I feel bad for celebrities sometimes. Yeah, sure they've got tons of money, but they've got no sense of privacy. Whatever they do, wherever they go, the whole world is watching. Whatever happened between Kidman and Cruise is nobody's businesss. It takes two to tango and marriage is a dance that few people can understand from the outside. Hell, sometimes it's impossible to understand from the inside! But more about my aversion to marriage later on... ;)

        urlLink     Goddesses and all   Didn't leave the apartment until 3pm, got up at noon, though I kept waking up this morning etc. Went to go see  urlLink Nick Hanlon & the Goddesses  at The Basement. The sets were excellent. It was a moving, exciting, and relaxing experience. I took lots of notes, so hopefully my review will be ready within the next day or so. It was great to just be there and be  in  the moment and just concentrate on the music, but every now and then my mind wandered a  lot . A whole lot. I started daydreaming about some of the most random and important things. I wrote some of my own song lyrics and got some ideas for writing pieces etc, which I'll discuss tomorrow probably. urlLink    For now I'm just putting up some photos and I'll have my corny "deep thoughts" comments tomorrow ;)    So here they are, the ever exciting Xmas party pics!  Up top, Kristen, Ruth, me and Jo's lovely friend whose name escapes me! Ooops! On the couch, me, Ruth, and Kristen, of course. I've got more pics of Jo and Ruth, but I'll post those later on. I've also posted some new funny pics from Homebake down below. Scroll down to December 8th to see 'em.  Typical Lori story: After the gig tonight, I walked to the bus stop on Geore St. @ Circular Quay and rang Kristen to let her know I was on my way home. Then I proceeded to daydream. Really hard. I vaguely spotted a Glebe Point Road bus in the next batch of approaching buses coming down the street. And went back to daydreaming. So the buses arrive and I hop on and everything is a-ok until we get to the QVB and the bus suddenly starts to veer to the right. It's turning right instead of going straight like it's supposed.  I look behind me wildly to see the Glebe Point Road bus  behind  us. Doh! I ask the guy next to me where this bus is going. Five Dock, via Pyrmont. Hey, hey! Stupid Lori has gotten on the wrong bus. I live in such a little dreamworld, I'm surprised I haven't done it before, actually. So, the next thing I know, we're on the freeway and I am trying to figure out where the next stop will be so I can get off. I got off in Pyrmont and was too stubborn to get a cab and ended up walking home. It only took about 35 minutes and it was still light out, and frankly, I needed the exercise. I thought I knew where I was, and got more confident as I went, and I got home fine with no problems. My friend Lonny will enjoy this story (if he's reading!) because we'll never forget the time he tried to get my attention in the halls of Boston University's College of Communications and had to yell out my name 10 times and I didn't notice him until he was 1 inch from my face. Daydreamer, that's me...

        Dancing queens  Big thanks to Jo and Steve for inviting us to their amazing apartment (wow is it classier than the 1-star motel! ;) I took Kristen and Ruth along and we had a great time. All of Steve and Jo's friends are so nice and very friendly and cool. We ate, we danced, we drank, we ate, we danced, and we drank some more. They had a mexican xmas thing going, so tacos, salsa, guacamole, plus some kangaroo and sausages etc. Funny dance music too. Jo is quite the dancer, I had no idea. She and I realised that we should have started going clubbing together ages ago. Some people told me I should have been a dancer and asked if I ever took dance classes. I have taken that one modern dance class and my dance teacher said I had perfect foot arches and had a long neck/body etc, but alas, I am a klutz. I'm sorry, but once you pop out your knee cap twice for no good reason either time, you just have to realise the klutz factor is going to catch up with you at some point. So, my "professional dancing" days will only be at various clubs/parties around Sydney  for now ;)   Anyway, we had a ton of fun, some great conversations etc. We also played truth or dare jenga. Once I answered my first green piece so ever truthfully, everyone wanted me to keep getting green pieces. Sorry, I cannot repeat my answers in this family forum :) As for the dare portion, I told a silly joke, did my best Austin Powers impression and rubbed noses with someone. Quite the rebel, I am!  We took some cute pictures at the party, including those of Kristen and I in our matching Santa hats, so I'll probably post those tomorrow. Tonight was an excellent distraction from a stressful week. So glad I went - just what the doctor ordered! And for the record, Kristen and I kept our hats on for just about the entire party. I had to keep mine on so as avoid the "bangs plastered to my forehead" syndrome.   It's after 3am here now, so by the time I get up tomorrow it'll probably be time to head down to The Basement for Nick Hanlon and the Goddesses. I've got two complimentary passes, so I'll likely write a review. They were excellent last time, so looking forward to it.  Sweet dreams!  p.s. I was wowed by my "lucky" sense of direction. Where Jo and Steve live - well, it's an area that's brand new. It doesn't exist on any map. Can't find their street on any map. No cab drivers have ever heard of it. But I wrote down some directions from Jo and would you believe we found it in two minutes? No dramas. No weirdness. Easy as pie. Amazing :)

        urlLink   We had a super day at Manly Beach today. Perfect weather, beautiful ocean. Only bummer was that we couldn't go into the water due to the massive amounts of bluebottle jellyfish. We still just had an amazing time laying in the sand. I even dozed off, which never happens (because I'm afraid to wake up as a lobster), but today I snoozed. Don't worry, I snoozed with my SPF100 sunblock on, so I was fine. My hair seems slightly slightly lighter, but it might be a psychosomatic thing as I'm hoping the sun will lighten my hair, as usual.     I don't think Australia is ready for my albino white body, yet it's about to see more of it. A ground-breaking Lori event occurred today. I bought my first bikini ever. And my second one too. I've never had an actual bikini before and I'm still slightly apprehensive about it, but we'll see how it goes. One of them is bright turquoise with a little studded silver star on the left chest triangle and little silver studs all along the waistband of the bottom. The other one is yellow, turquoise, and magenta on white. The bottom is striped, the top has a star on the left triangle as well.  I can mix and match both bikinis. I tried my darndest to find a bathing suit with a butterfly, but no luck. I found one with a dragonfly, but not in my size/style. Poor Kristen waited patiently outside for me as I tried on about 8 different bikinis - she was a brave little soldier. And in true Gemini form, I couldn't decide between two of them, so I got both ;) I haven't bought a bathing suit in over 4 years, so I was overdue. Though how they can charge so much for such a tiny amount of material, I have no idea.    urlLink   Pics from Thursday, Saturday, and today still to be posted (no, no pics of me in my bikinis!)  Hey you family folks: I'll be ringing Babci's around 2pm, and the McGuires' around 4pm on Christmas Day, your time, which is the day after Christmas here. Now, let's not repeat earlier family phone calls, folks. I will speak to every family member in attendance, so no one has to take the phone and run into the bathroom and lock themselves in to ensure they get their Lori time (though I appreciated your admirable effort, Auntie Kate!)

       It's about 2.30am and I have no idea why I'm not fast asleep yet! We didn't leave the apartment until 4.30pm today and went straight to Angela's for her going away party/BBQ, which was a lot of fun. Really hate to see Ang go, but now I have yet another excuse to pop down to Melbourne for the weekend!  Wait till you guys see the funny party pics!  So yeah, had a great time at Ang's then we went with Andrew to go see the Matt Downey band. Excellent show from them and then The Camels came on to do their own stuff, plus a Christmas Medley with special guests. Very entertaining evening, with the funniest on-stage smooch I've seen in ages. For the last song, Matt and the lead Camels dude invited me up on stage. I went up there, but don't worry, I didn't sing, I just danced and ignored my pangs to grab the microphone and belt out a tune ;)  We were originally planning to head to the Glenmore Hotel in the Rocks to meet up with the lovely  urlLink Fidelma  and  urlLink Shay  and crew after the bands, but we were too pooped and hungry. Plus, we want to go to the beach tomorrow and want to leave the apartment at a reasonable hour. Bed time! Sweet dreams!

Very fun, funny, and lord the pizza and bruschetta was yummy. We're both coughing now - possibly from the smoke from the fires? My head is pounding - off to bed!

It was pretty damn hot on the 6th floor (top floor) of a building with no air-conditioning. But we survived. As I always say, I'd rather sweat than shiver!   I'm gearing up for my writers' group meeting this Sunday and a gig at the Metro on Saturday...the weekend is looking good....thank you to Shayna, Lisa, Rachel, and Babci for the cards I received in the mail (old fashioned snail mail - woo-hoo!) today. I feel so loved :)

       p.s. Viruses suck. I hope the computer viruses I received at 1.02 am this morning aren't a sign of how 2002 is going to progress! I've got about 12 infected files on my computer. If you've received anything with an attachment from me in the last 24 hours, please delete it. It's a weird little virus that, amongst other things,  sends out randomly named files to people. My mother received a file called "Nude Me" and I was horrified. Just delete, people. Just delete! I apologise for the annoyance! If you successfully downloaded the file by accident, do a google search for "Badtrans" cleaning utilities. I've got Badtrans.B.Trojan and Badtrans.B.Worm.  Lovely.   Happy New Year (Again) Hope you're all happy and healthy and well!

        urlLink   "Hey, hey, hey, it was really damn hot on New Year's Day today, but we cooled off at Broadway and survived in the apartment with fans blaring. We weren't out too too late last night, but our sleeping schedule has been screwy for the last week, so we needed to sleep in today. I had a big brainstorming session today for writing projects, so I'm pretty pleased about that.   Last night was simply amazing. We staked out the best NYE spot ever at Mrs. Macquarie's Chair, which has the view of the Opera House with the Harbour Bridge behind it. We could not have asked for a better spot. I took a whole roll of pics of the fireworks, though I know they will never come out. Oh well, I couldn't help myself. I get the pics back on Friday, so expect to see something next week. Anyhoo, we all brought blankets, food, drinks, and had a little picnic in the afternoon and evening leading up to the 9pm and midnight fireworks. Watching the fireworks explode over the harbour, it was the perfect way to start 2002!  Back to work tomorrow - the party is over! ;)

        urlLink   Just spent another great day with Rachel and Anthony today - we've been having a super time and I've loved showing them around. I was very sad to say goodbye to them tonight. For those of you who don't know, Rachel was my roommate at Boston University for two years, as well as one of my best friends. Due to a random idea I had on Australia Day 99, (Story coming later), Rachel met Anthony, a great Aussie from Melbourne. Nearly 3 years later, they're married :) I like to joke around and say, "Hey, no fair, I got you an Aussie guy in Boston....I live here and I still don't have one. When are you going to return the favour?" ;)  Unfortunately, I don't have any pics of Rach and Anthony to post here just yet. But once I get them developed, here they will go! We spent the day at Manly Beach today. Perfect beach day and as usual, just as I was gearing up to go into the water, the bluebottle jellyfish started coming in. Drat! Foiled again!   urlLink   I'm exhausted...off to bed! Lots of love to everyone I care about in Boston, Springfield & Massachusetts, Connecticut, San Fran, Hong Kong, Germany, Japan, Virginia, New Jersey, New York,  and anywhere else I've forgotten :)

        Happy Anniversary to Me!   Okay, so technically yesterday was my anniversary, but I'm always behind. ;) Yesterday, the 10th of January, was my 4 year anniversary of the first time I ever arrived in Australia. Yes, indeed, I first stepped on to Australian ground on January 10th, 1998. Four years ago! Can't believe it. Crazy, huh? Funnily enough, Kristen and I went to Broadway to get a few things (she and I are still sick as dogs and I actually had to take the day off from work today because I didn't sleep at all last night due to my horrible coughing fits) and we were crossing the street I looked behind us to see a big group of young-20-looking-somethings. I thought I heard Yankee accents. I immediately turned around and said to the "leader," - "Hey, are you guys on the B.U. program?" She looked surprised but said that they were. She was the one of the Resident's Assistants. I explained by saying I was on the B.U. program in '98. I just wanted to take the kids aside and tell them all the REAL places to go. The best restaurants, places for live music, places to travel etc. I remember that when I was doing the program in 1998, the previous students gave us crappy advice on where to go. They told us to go to Scruffy Murphy's for pete's sake! Bad, bad, bad. I'm going to call Kerry and Kevin, who run the program, and ask them if I can come speak to the little students and tell them the real places to go!  Quarter Acre is playing at Club 77 tonight and the Bacardi Festival is happening at Darling Harbour, but considering how I'm feeling I just want to stay in and go to bed with my box of kleenex and cough drops.  Funnily enough I ran into Andrew from Quarter Acre tonight at Broadway. It's a small small world after all!  On a positive note, I treated myself to CDs that were on sale today. They were like 50% off. I got Tori Amos'  Little Earthquakes  which is my favourite CD of hers. I've only ever had it on cassette tape, so since it was like $12, I had to get it. I finally got The Strokes  Is This It?   (for half price!) so I can give my friend her CD back now.  And finally, no purchase would be complete without a bit of 80s nostalgia. I actually bought Heart's  Greatest Hits  featuring gems like "What About Love," "If Looks Could Kill," "Never," "These Dreams," "Alone," "There's the Girl," "All I Wanna Do is Make Love to You" etc. These songs came out when I was like 8 and 9 years-old and they were actually a big influence on my attempts at arty love songwriting when I was 8-11 years old. If only I could have sung like the Wilson sisters. It was funny because I was just talking about them last night. We were discussing the  Singles  soundtrack and I was saying how I loved the Lovemonger's of the Led Zep song, "Battle of Evermore" and I said, "Hey, you know who the Lovemongers are? Those are the sisters from Heart!" And lo and behold, I find their greatest hits today. Too funny.   Off to cough!

        The Inconvenient Convenience Store   So it finally happened. The guy who runs the convenience store near work finally asked me out today. I knew it was going to happen. He's been flirting with me for months and always tries to give me something free with every purchase, like a pack of gum or a chocolate or something. I always try to say no or give it back, but he just slips it into the bag. It's funny because he tries to be nonchalant about it, but everyone in line behind me can totally see him throwing in an extra bit of something. They look at me like, "Why does  she  get special treatment? Hmmmphhh!"  Anyhoo, he always asks me what time I get out of work that night and I always say, "Oh, really late!" I didn't want to go in the store today, but I needed a phone card and there were no other options. So today he asked me out for coffee. I was about to say I had plans with my non-existent boyfriend, but just after I said, "Sorry, I have plans...." someone interrupted and I just yelled, "See ya!" and ski-daddled. He's the type of guy that would argue with me and try to convince me to go for coffee despite of a pesky boyfriend. I feel bad, next time I'll finish my sentence and somehow imply that my non-existent boyfriend is big and musce-ly and insanely jealous ;)   I'm a hacker, baby   I thought everyone would be glad to know that I am now officially a hacker. Not a computer hacker, but a coughing hacker. My co-workers must hate me. I spent 90% of the day coughing a lot. I'm changing my middle name to phlegm. Coughing fits are oh so attractive! My boss ordered me to leave at 4pm, probably because he was sick of hearing me cough, but I didn't leave until 5.30, which is probably the earliest I have ever left...ever. I have to say...being a hacker is totally overrated! ;)

        The Drugs Don't Work   Have I become immune to over-the-counter cold & flu medicine? I went out and got the herbal stuff and the "kill-my-symptoms" stuff. Echinacea, vitamin c, zink, you name it. Nothing. Cough, cold, and flu medicine. Nothing. Cough syrup. Nothing. Don't worry - haven't been using them all at the same time, but I've tried 'em all and none of them have even made any difference. And more importantly, why do I continue to buy such crappy medicine that doesn't do anything. I've spent a good $50 in tissues, cough drops, cough syrup, echinacea, zinc, vitamin c, cold & flu pills. Silly really. Now, if I could just stay at home, I wouldn't care. But I have to go to work, so I need to not be coughing up a lung while on the phone with clients or blowing my nose in their ear. I look like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. Very attractive. It feels weird to have the flu in this weather. It's hot.  Oh well, I'll stop whinging now, it's not a big deal, I just hate being sick when it's so nice out!   I have a medicine cabinet in my purse...and the darn drugs just don't work...

        A tale of vegemite...   I forgot to write this up on Friday, but I went to the new little cafe near our office to get some vegemite toast for me and some food for my co-workers. The guy looked at me strangely and asked "Who is this vegemite toast for?" I said it was for me and he shook his head and said, "But aren't you British?" I was surprised. My American accent may have toned down slightly since I've been living here, but I certainly shouldn't be mistaken for being British. (Actually, a woman who worked at this other sandwich shop thought I was British too, but she wasn't the brightest bulb in the box.)  I told the guy that I was in fact American and he looked at me for a while and said, "But Americans don't eat this stuff!" And I said, "Yeah, I know, but it's taken me me two years to like it!" He was amazed. So there you go.. ;)

       Aren't three dots annoying?  Tonight Kristen and I watched some show called "Miami Undercover" which should really be called "Biggest Collection of Losers We Could Find Try To Score and Fail Miserably...with British Accents." Yes, I know, we sunk to a new low by watching the dumb show, but we're both sick and we needed a nice little reminder that we're overall pretty damn cool and sensible people, despite our hacking fits. May we never meet such a pack of losers in real life.   So I've got the flu, which is a bit annoying, but whatever. At least I'm not a dork being featured on "Miami Undercover."   I was feeling a bit nostalgic tonight and looked at some of the video of this party at had at my place in Boston in 1999 with my friends from mybytes.com. That was one of the most hilarious nights I've ever had and we went around the room and told each other (and the camera) what we wanted to be doing within the next ten years. Should be interesting to see what happens. We told a lot of secrets that night - I've got so many funny reactions on tape -- I was laughing just as hard watching it nearly 3 years later! I should write a top ten list of the top ten funniest lines said that night. So, big hellos to Brian, Charlie, Jill, Dave, Andrew, Lauren, Nicole, Abbey, Melissa, Bonnie, and Jay. :)

        urlLink    Well, well, well. Hasn't someone been naughty by not updating her blog in ages? First things first, I was born lazy and that certainly hasn't changed this year. Secondly, I've been too busy to blog (old lame excuse). Thirdly, let's just say that a lot of things happening lately weren't exactly bloggable. Nothing particularly scandalous, but the people involved certainly wouldn't appreciate me blogging about them. But I'm trying to make up for all that by being bloggy today. (Notice how I've just used "blog" as a noun, verb, adjective, etc.)   urlLink   The last couple weeks have been fun albeit stressful. I had a round-table interview with Eric Bana last week. He was in town promoting his new movie,  Black Hawk Down  which I found to be pretty effective in portraying the hell of war. It was agonising and gripping to watch, and I think that's what they were going for. My review of the movie and the interview with Eric will be posted on  urlLink Yap  soon. I'll link to it then. The premiere of  Black Hawk Down  was pretty cool. Unfortunately I missed out on the pre-movie drinks/schmoozing fest but I was pleasantly surprised to find a copy of the novel sitting on every seat in the big Hoyts Fox Studios theatre. Very cool. I'll read that next. The movie itself kept me squirming in my seat, almost as much as the cab driver who drove me to the theatre. If I ever get a normal cab driver, I swear I am going to tip him/her, just because. This guy couldn't keep his hands off me, literally. What a punk!

        Fridays That Feel Like Mondays Can't Be Good!  Crazy crazy day, as usual. Tonight should be a fairly quiet night, feasting on some yummy Spanish Tapas, hanging out with a few friends then going home to play the "What can I save on my computer now?" Game! I finally found my warranty receipt for my illing computer. It's good through October 2003, so hopefully Compaq Sydney will come through for me. (Fingers crossed! Toes too!)   Today I called my cousin Rob around 11pm his time in the U.S. I called him on my mobile phone, so I only spoke to him for a few minutes, planning a good catch-up session for the weekend. It was funny, I was like, "Happy, Happy 18th Birthday! I can't talk long, I'm on a cell phone and I'm in the ladies' toilets at work!" I'm all about class, really.   Tomorrow night I'm going to my friend Lisa's birthday bash in Mosman. I might actually try to put up a few recent amusing stories here this weekend, computer permitting.  There's a fun press conference coming up in two weeks - part two of the  Black Hawk Down  series. This time Ridley Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer will be fielding the questions. So if any of you have some juicy questions you'd like me to ask them,  urlLink mail me .

        Computers Are Evil   A brief update...  1) My computer has shat itself. 2) My computer has shat itself big time. 3) Have I mentioned that my computer is screwed? 4) Spending most of time uploading files online or saving onto a floppy. 5) Spending rest of time remembering files I should save before my computer dies. 6) Spending rest rest of time lamenting over software I will have no more. 7) Spending tonight searching for my Compaq warranty and praying that it is still in effect. 8) Vowing to print out copies or make copies of everything I do from here on in. (Yeah right, who does that!?) 9) Planning on being on phone to Compaq support until the wee hours tonight, hoping they don't tell me that yes, I will indeed be losing everything on my computer! Woo-hoo! 10) Realising having a computer is like having an apartment. You don't realise how much crap you accumulate over two years and how much you want to keep it all ;)  Okay, enough rambling about my stupid computer.  Last Thursday I saw Dan's band, Twelve 24 at their final gig ever, for a while at least and it was excellent! Thanks for the CD, Dan! I will blog about Australia Day and my writer's group thingy later.....much later.  I started my Chaos Theory, Complexity and Catastrophe class last night. It was very interesting, but I was sleepy before I got there, so milling over cosmology and algorithms wasn't quite what I needed. I have learned that there is a term for me in "Chaos Theory." I am an "attractor," meaning something that attracts chaos to it. If that ain't me in a nutshell, I don't know what is! Maybe I'll teach a course soon called Chaos and Freaks! Or the Fractals of Freaks! :)  Work is also crazy and busy, and probably a working model of organised Chaos. We miss you, Owen! :) I'm also taking a Self Defense Techniques course in March and a "How to Deal with Difficult People" course next month. That should come in handy all over the place.   Happy Birthday to Rob! I can't believe you're 18 now! God, I feel so old!!!  Alrighty, off home now to do more uploading/saving/praying :)

        Stupid Lori Tricks   Guess who was in her elevator last night, on her way up to the third floor....opening up an envelope with keys in her hand, only to drop the keys and have them zoom STRAIGHT down the elevator shaft a.k.a. oblivion? Guess who promptly went down to the carpark and tried to stick her little hand down the shaft to find the keys to no avail? Guess who has NO copies of her new security keys for the building or keys to her actual apartment anywhere except on the the key chain that is now resting comfortably at the bottom of an elevator shaft? :) *Raising hand like the big dork I am*  I called the elevator people last night. It would have cost me $350 to have someone come over and get the keys out for me after hours. Then they said it would "only" cost $200 to get them out today. But if I wait for the next fortnightly servicing, they'll just get 'em out for free while they're doing maintenance and stick them in my mailbox. No one has any copies of my keys to get in the building or to my apartment. Doh. This really nice guy in my building who I occasionally say hi to was a doll and he gave me a spare set of the building's new honking expensive security keys. But I can't get into my actual apartment.  I rang my real estate agent this morning, to no avail. I'm hoping I can go in and copy their keys to my apartment today or I'll be spending another night at a friend's place :(   My agent is notoriously flaky. I'm worried he won't even call me back by the end of the day. I'm gonna have to start the harassment!  Thanks to the lovely Reese's Pieces (Kristen) for letting me stay over last night. We had a wonderfully girlie evening, renting a Hugh Jackman movie ( Someone Like You ) and eating raw cookie dough out of the tube. Kristen's flatmate was so funny, "I can't believe you're eating biscuits with a spoon!"  I am very allergic to cats, but I took an antihistamine yesterday and again this morning, so I'm doing alright. The company and hospitality received 5 stars! :) The futon was very comfy. I kept having strange dreams though because the cat, Gino, kept coughing up hairballs all night and the retching sound would enter my dreams in various ways. Too funny.   In true continuous bad luck form, on my way out to the bus stop this morning, I was walking down the stairs and in an attempt to avoid slipping on these wet garbage bags on the steps, I tried to go around them and walked/fell straight into this metal pipe sticking out of the building. Kristen was in front of me, and was out the door so she didn't have to see my klutziness in action. I just hunched over and grabbed my knee, screaming a silent scream. It was my left knee, my good knee (the one I haven't dislocated twice). I kept thinking of poor Nancy Kerrigan. (My knee! My knee!) Her enemy was Tonya, my enemy is me. I regrouped by the time Kristen came out of the newsagent and I sheepishly told her that Klutzo had struck again!  We got to the bus stop and the bus was right there! I thought for sure it would take off without me. Quick goodbye hugs to Kristikeet and sure enough, the driver closed the door. Then a miraculous thing happened. He took pity on me and opened them! That never happens to me. I thought the trip from Annandale was maybe $2.50, so I gave him a $2 coin and a 50 cent piece. He looked down and said "It's only $1.50." In my flustered attempt to do exact change, I took back the $2 coin and handed him the $1 coin. Of course as I was giving him the $1 coin, the $2 coin flew out of my hand and landed on his crotch. I was so embarassed! I yelled, "Ohmygod, I'm so sorry! I just dropped $2 on you!" He just shook his head, as if he just knew instinctively that I was a total spaz and silently handed me a $2 coin out of his change box, along with my receipt.  I swear my life is a walking physical comedy routine. This is why I think I love Mr. Bean so much. I relate to him. When that crazy crap happens to him in those episodes, I'm like, "Yup, I could see that happening to me!"   So, yes, this only adds to my belief that I was an incredibly evil person in a past life and this is karma paying me my dues now by throwing ridiculously funny/inconvenient events my way. If you look at my life, you'll see that nothing REALLY bad ever happens to me. Just a continuous string of little bizarre/annoying things.  I now have a huge bump/bruise forming on my left knee, and I am wearing the same jeans, socks, and underwear from yesterday, but luckily I keep deodorant, a hair brush, perfume, lipstick etc, in my backpack and Kristen leant me a nice clean shirt. I bought a little travel toothbrush and toothpaste this morning.    The more I think about it, the more I realise klutziness is in my genes. I am the daughter of a man who has broken his nose playing golf where neither a ball nor a golf club was involved, and I am the granddaughter of dear woman, who once managed to break her collar bone playing poker! It's not hard to do the math.  Is it any wonder I've dislocated my knee twice or dropped my keys down an elevator shaft?  I really hope to be sleeping in my own bed tonight! Come on, real estate agent! Call me back!

        Go Patriots!   I was as baffled as the next New Englander that the Patriots actually made it into the Superbowl, nevermind that they actually won! Maybe this means there's hope for the Chicago Cubs one day too! Anyway, go home team!  I'm actually really disappointed I didn't get to see the Superbowl entertainment, particularly U2's performance. The tribute to the Sept. 11th victims sounds awfully moving and I can just imagine the crowd going wild when Bono opened his jacket to reveal stars and stripes. My friend who died on Sept. 11th in the WTC was a huge fan of Bono and U2. I hope she heard them singing to her today. We miss you, my friend.

        Cricket Happy   I'm off to bed now, but just wanted to give a big shout out to team Australia for putting on such a good game today. The Aussies rocked. I'm bummed that their win was not enough to see them through to the end, but it was a great match, as well as a crazy one. A lot of fairly rare things happened and even a poor seagull died after being hit in the head with a ball. :(  Many many thanks to  urlLink Shay  and Sal for being such superb hosts and teachers! Kristen and I spent the day with them, along with Chad (Hi, Chad, O Loyal Reader) and Andy. It was a lot of fun and I have a ton of respect for the game of cricket. Holy cow, it's WAY more complicated and involved than I'd ever imagined. Obviously, I still have a lot to learn, but I know enough to be able to keep up now without a blank stare! (Thanks, Shay!) We learned a lot today and I'm looking forward to the next game!   More about the day later, I need to sleep!!!

        Swimming Like Fishes, Birthday Madness, Good Chats, and Desperate Men  It's going on 4am and I just got home from Lisa and Ingrid's joint birthday party. I had a ton of fun tonight. It was just really relaxed and laidback. Lisa and Alex live in a beautiful house in a beautiful neighbourhood in Mosman with a beautiful view. And I brought my bathing suit, so I had a nice long dip in the pool. Everyone was really nice. I met some really lovely people and I got to catch up with another old co-worker of mine, Dan.   I'm currently listening to Alicia Keys,  Songs in A Minor . Oh to have her pipes!  I am zonked!   Tomorrow I am going to learn all about cricket! The super sweet and brave  urlLink Shay  has offerred to teach me the rules of the game. I've been here two years and no one has ever told me what's going on. I am looking forward to 8 hours of instruction tomorrow with some great company and some good snacks. I am intrigued by a sport involving sweaters and tea breaks! Plus, looking forward to seeing Shay and Sal's famous Paddington Pad!  On my way to Mosman, I was waiting for the bus at Wynyard and all of a sudden this guy comes over to me and puts his arm around me and asks me if I want to go home with him. He was obviously smashed. I was like, "Don't touch me," and his friend ordered him to, "take your hands off of her."  What a freak. The idiot persisted in telling me how "sexy" I am and asked for a root. Charming. I moved to another bus stand and he followed me to ask if I wanted to go home with him. What is wrong with people?  Then, on the way home, I had the taxi drop me off just down the street from where I live. Literally a minute walk away. This car passed me and pulled over on my street corner. The guys leaned out and asked me if I wanted a ride home. FREAKS! I am living up to my "attractor" nickname! I thought my perfume was vanilla and not "eau du desperation."  Anyhoo, still had a fun night dancing and chatting.   Sweet dreams.

        Happy Birthday, Babies!  Big Happy Birthday wishes to Auntie Kate and Jessie!    Storm Chasers   All we wanted was to go to Chilli's. It's an American chain Tex-Mex restaurant and since Heather and Kristen are with us at the same time, we decided it would be fun to do a little night of Americana with Jorge and Ray. Poor Ray. Outnumbered by four Americans, he didn't really have a chance.  There are three Chilli's that we know of. One in Wentworthville, one in Campbelltown, and one in Wollongong. We were going to Wentworthville because it was closest. Heather, Kristen, and I had never been to Chilli's in Oz.  It seemed like a simple plan.  We left at 6pm so we could be stuffing our faces by 7.30pm. We weren't trying to do anything fancy. We just wanted a bit of Tex-Mex with free refills, waitresses/waiters we would remember, and a bit of corny Yank nostalgia.  So, we're going along, the boys up front, and the three gals wedged in the backseat. As we're driving, the heavens open up and treat us to a thunderstorm full of heavy rain and hail and all that fun stuff. It's really hard to see, but Ray keeps driving bravely. Finally we spot the Chilli's sign. It calls to us, like a beacon in the night. But it's on the "wrong" side of the road, so Ray take a right to try to come around from the other side. Okay, so we get a teensy weensy bit lost. Just momentarily. HUGE apologies to the poor woman walking on the sidewalk of that little side street we went down. This one street was totally flooded and the car in front of us went by and sprayed a tsunami over this poor lady. We yell, "Oh no!" at the poor dear getting soaked while realising we are about to do the same thing. Ooops!  So, an hour or so after leaving Newtown, we pull up to the infamous Chilli's. We cheer! We made it. Then we say, "Huh. Doesn't it look awfully dark in there?"  And we notice all these people coming out. Huh. Ray immediately starts freaking out saying, "Don't tell me they're closed!" So Jorge and I walk in the restaurant, leaving Ray, Kristen and Heather in the car, to go check out the situation. Women coming out tell me, "You won't get any food in there!" I grab a Chilli's employee and ask, "Are you closed?" And he says yup. The electrical storm knocked out the electricity. So Chilli's is closed.  What are the chances? We're all infamous for our bad luck, particularly the chaos attractors Lori and Kristen.   Plan B   We could just go back to Sydney, but we're starving. So we're going to drive another half hour to the Chilli's in Campbelltown. We call ahead to make sure they're open. They are. They seem surprised that we ask if they're open. We also want to ask, "Right, so you're really open? How's the weather looking outside?"  So we trek along to Chilli's number two and we get stuck in major traffic. Why is there major traffic? Because the road is totally flooded. At this point Ray says, "Okay, I have to ask a question. Is it just me or is this a sign that we're not meant to go to Chilli's? Is God telling us to turn back?"  We try to be encouraging and say, "Ah Ray, you can make it, the flooding's not that bad!" Meanwhile, there are two rrushing rivers forming on either side of us and  I mistake a tree floating by for a crocodile swimming on through. Policemen are directing cars and their scared drivers through the raging waters in the street. We make it through the first lake, but it's pretty rough going. We wait and wait and see cars up ahead making illegal U-Turns because the roads are too flooded. Ray begs us to give in. We agree. So Ray follows suit and makes a U-turn as well.   It was such a simple plan.   Go to Chilli's. Eat Tex Mex. Come home.  That's all.    Plan C   So we start heading back to Sydney, wondering why we ever bothered to leave Newtown. I mean really, with the 5 of us together, we were just asking for trouble. About 2  minutes into the drive back, Ray spots a "Lonestar" restaurant and says, "How about here?" And we all say, "Hell yeah!"  So we go in and there's a 30 minute wait so we head for the bar. I grab a Heineken in the spirit of Yankeeism and we wait for our magic table buzzer to blink and buzz. Every half hour the Lonestar waitresses are subjected to supreme humiliation by having to form a cirle around the tables and perform the "Lonestar" dance, which is like a half-assed choreographed cross between country line-dancing and the Macarena. We felt so bad for these girls. They looked like they wanted to die. The poor things!   So I was totally in the mood for a big juicy steak for a good 40 minutes, yet what do I end up ordering? The fish & chips. Leave it to me to order the fish & chips at a steakhouse!   So, it was a simple plan. We left at 6pm. We ate around 10pm. The food was yummy though. I was so full. I'd ordered cheese fries with melted monterrey jack and swiss chese and ranch dressing as an appetiser. I thought I'd have to be rolled out of the restaurant.   We never got our Chilli fix. Lord knows when we'll try again. But one thing's for sure. We're going to check the weather channel first ;)

        "Sleep, Sleep is Good"   Only Rammstein will fully get the title for today's blog, but the general idea is what I mean today. As I barely slept Friday or Saturday nights and I slept badly last night. Lil' Loz's (Aussification of Lori) been tired all day long. It is about 9pm and I was supposed to do some web work tonight, but methinks I'm going to go to bed now as I've got an early meeting @ work tomorrow. (By the way, Chad, my co-workers/friends  have  been calling me Loz...in addition to Lozza, Lozzarina, Lozzana, Lozzy Lozzy Lozzy Oy Oy Oy [yeah, I know], Truck and of course Butterfly and Biscuit, and other terms of endearment I won't type here. But thank you for pointing out that technically, Loz is my proper Aussie name as it contains less syllables than Lori ;)   There are lots of cool musical happenings this week and I really want to go to them all, but there's a chance I may miss all of them - crazy huh? Sad, really...but I've got after-work drinks tomorrow, Chaos Theory class on Wednesday, and Valentine's Day a.k.a. "Thank God I'm Single" Day to celebrate with all my single female friends on Thursday. So hopefully Friday/Saturday will give me that music boost I'm needing if I can't pack it in during the week.   I had a dream last night that I was on a talk radio show trying to figure out the biggest questions of the world...i.e.  "What is the meaning of life?"  "Is there a God?"  "Is there life after death?" "Why are we here?" and "Why do I always come up with new melodies for songs when I'm in the loo?"  Maybe I'll dream the answers tonight! ;)

        The Best Laid Plans, Good Musical Outings, & Dealing With Difficult People 101   Damn, and I was being so good about writing too! :(  Friday night was not all it was meant to be. We had to ditch our Mike Patton solo gig plan at kinda the last minute and  urlLink Fidelma  and I have decided that we're totally jinxed. Whenever we try to make plans, a phenomenal hail storm occurs.  No, really. I think Zeus is trying to keep us apart. I think we need to create some sort of secret signal so we never speak of our plans aloud. If we talk about it, it won't happen. So we need something like baseball signals, only ones that can be transmitted over e-mail/mobile. If anyone has any suggestions, let me know. Even the plans of dancing were not all they were meant to be. Big sorries to Jo, Dan, Jorge, and Kristen - you guys know why! (Actually, some dumbass Cole's worker knows why too, but he was clueless ;)  Anyhoo, Friday night ended with a big stomach ache and not much sleep, but Saturday proved to be much better.  I got a fair bit of writing done during the day and then I night I went to see the hilariously talented  urlLink Merri May Gill  @ Cafe 9. The food was excellent, as was the entertainment.  I believe Ms. Gill is coming back to Sydney, maybe round May, and I highly recommend. She combines comedy and bluesy/folky/rocky/country music and she has a super set of pipes. Perhaps I'll round up a posse next time...Anyway it was funny because I was just talking about  urlLink Yap  and Mel and who walks in Cafe 9 but Mel? Do-dee-doo-doo-DOOOO! Thankfully, I was only saying nice things ;)  After Merri May Gill, we went to go see Salmonella Dub @ DCM on Oxford Street. I'd never been there before and I'm dying to know if the dance floor always feels like it's going to cave in like that! ;) The joint was packed and sweaty and all that fun stuff, but Salmonella put on another fabulous show. Very mellow, very laid-back, very groove-quenching, very contagious. I've seen them before, and I look forward to seeing them again, though outside with a little more personal space would be nice :)  Huge thanks to C for a very fun evening! ;)  I got home around 2 a.m. than talked on the phone with Reese's Pieces until nearly 3 a.m. - after all, we had an entire 12 hours to catch up on! :)  Anyhoo, I went to be around 3.30 and when my lil alarm clock started screeching at me at 7 a.m. I was not a happy camper. I had my "How to Deal with Difficult People" course from 9am-5pm. It was very interesting and a good refresher course from my Cognitive Behavioural Therapy class from 2 years ago...now I have to see how much I've learned by interacting with all those punks in my life ;)  Gotta do some work, then I'm off to bed, I am so zonked!  p.s. Tomahawk rocked my world on Thursday...but I haven't the energy to discuss that now! Sweet dreams!

        Geez, Louise, What is it with Me & Keys?   Oh for the love of God! It's after 8pm, and I'm still here at work. I thought I was leaving a little while ago but guess who just realised she doesn't have her work keys on her and can't leave because she can't lock the office door? DOH!  Wes doesn't have keys period and I thought I had mine and just found out I don't. Oy. So Wes is off getting keys off of Dion who lives the closest and I'm guarding the ship. I just locked up the office yesterday. I'm guessing my work keys are in the pants pocket of the jeans I wore yesterday. Yup, that's what I would do....*thinking of supergluing all necessary keys to my body* I guess it's good I have my house keys and work keys on separate chains...so I will always be able to get in somewhere!   After we lock up, I will be heading off to an unknown movie at Broadway. Very mysterious! C and I are going to do eeenie meanie minie moe!  Congrats to  urlLink Fidelma  on finding a flat! Yay!  And even more  congrats to my cousin Rob for getting into college with a scholarship! Yeah, baby, yeah! :) I'm verrrrrrry proud of you, kiddo!

       My computer is dead. I think. Work has been insane. Clients have been insane. I might be going insane. Yap died. Yap was resurrected. I thought I had lost over a year's worth of articles, but not yet. However I think I've lost the rest of my home computer files. I now want to write everything in a paper notebook and never use a computer again. Which is bad considering my job. Too much to write, too much to say. Not enough time. Left work around 11.30pm last night, if that gives you any indication.  Going out for girls night out tonight. Thank bloody goodness!  Happy Mardi Gras for tomorrow.   If my computer is dead, won't update again until at least Monday!  p.s. Go see  urlLink Shay's  awesome Oscar tipping thingymabob! Go Shay! p.p.s. Thanks to Sal for taking the awesome aussie pic of me, Shay, and Kristen. Will be posted asap!

       Poor little blogger has been down for maintenance. I really wanted to post early last night and then when I got home from last night, but I had to be a patient little butterfly. Blogger is a free service and it's freaking cool, so who am I to whinge if every so often I have to be patient?  Anyhoo, I have loads to catch up on....

       I must be officially insane. I'm going out for the 3rd week night in a row...woo-hoo! Going to check out L'otel with Chad tonight to see all the 'Beautiful People.'  Maybe I should bring a mask? :)  Last night I went with C to the Hopetoun for some country and western. No really. It was a free gig and C was very persuasive so I figured, why not? This is coming from the person who got like a half an hour's sleep the night before. Stupid me.  So I paid for it this morning, but oh well....okay off to Town Hall now...couple of writing exercises online now...check 'em out if you're insanely bored, both written in 15 minutes and no-editing!   urlLink The Storm    urlLink Dignity

       My computer is semi-dead. I have no idea, really. We'll see when I get home tonight.  Well. This has been quite the last few days. Lots of craziness. But right now I'm a bit disappointed because it looks like I'm going to have to end one of my longest friendships in Australia. I've tried to remain friends with this person, but frankly, I don't have the energy or the patience or the time to deal with their bullsh*t. I don't claim innocence here. I'm know I haven't handled things particularly well either, but at least I've made some effort. So yeah, I'm disappointed that it's come to this. And I'm sorry to say that age doesn't necessarily bring widsom or maturity. I'm the 'baby' in this friendship and yet I've managed to be the 'grown-up'  for the most part. In retrospect I should have handled things differently, but looking back I also realise that the ending would have been the same, no matter the path I chose to take. I've taken the scenic route when I should have taken the short-cut, but I've learned a lot along the ride. And I just wouldn't be me if I cut to the chase instead of letting the story drag out.   I've been thinking a lot lately about the type of person I am and the type of person I enjoy being. I take full responsibility for my actions and words when I am in any context, but more and more I notice how some people just really are more conducive to bringing out the best in you while others are more skilled in helping to bring out the worst in you. Like I said, my behaviour is still up to me, no matter who I am around, but I can't deny that I am a better me in the presence of certain people, while others, as much as I care about them, only seem to drag me down. The other night I met this person who had a real knack for getting me going in a good way. You know those nights when you're out at a party or gathering and you're just fully switched on? You're an intensive version of you - comfortable, laid-back, attentive, outspoken, you're just in your groove. Well it was a nice reminder that there are still people out there I can be like that with. With this above-mentioned friend, I've felt boring and stale and inhibited. Certainly not a version of me I want to be.  I've got Jeff Buckley's 'Last Goodbye' playing in my head right now....it's been nice knowing you, my friend, even when things weren't very nice....

        urlLink    Queen of the Band   That random photo (How incognito am I? But I'm in a butterfly shirt, so you know it's me!) was taken on a cliffwalk from Bondi to Coogee. We were walking along and someone had left a big cooler with an orphan bunny rabbit sitting on it. Since the rabbit and I were wearing matching jean skirts, I thought it only fair we take a picture to celebrate the moment. The rabbit gave me a hippie vibe, hence my pathetic peace sign.  Thanks to the lovely  urlLink Fidelma  for the title for today's blog. Can't go to see  Queen of the Damned  next week because I've got class, but I am going to try to continue to live up to my title of Queen of the Band by showing support for our talented locals. Speaking of talented locals, I highly recommend going to see ESN at Vic on the Park tomorrow night, with The Devoted Few and Kindling.   HUGE congrats to Rachel for getting into the London School of Economics! That's awesome. I'm very proud of you, Mrs. Humperbumper aka Schmoopie :)  My 'plan' is going well...it's going according to plan. :) Basically, I made a decision on how I was going to handle an issue with someone and I'm sticking to it. Almost caved on Tuesday but I snapped back into sanity and am relieved to say it's all back on track. Except for Tuesday, it's a hell of a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. It's all about getting control over the situation...I'd had it before, then it was up in the air for a while, now I've got it back again and I can concentrate on far more important things. After all, it's all those little insignificant stupid things that we spend the most time worrying about and it leaves us with no energy/time to concentrate on what's really important....enough of that!

        urlLink   Can't write now...off to see some cool bands play with Craig at Bar Broadway and then the Metro...yay! --------- 11.56pm Okay, I'm back. BIG thanks to Craig for the invite to the FMR shindig at Bar Broadway this evening. We were greated with polaroids as name-tags, complete with glowsticks. Let me tell you, putting that glowstick in my purse was a great idea - I could find everything! :) We saw Anelle (sp?), Motor Ace, gEORGE...all very cool, especially gEORGE. Just got their CD on the weekend, it's excellent. Oh to be able to sing even 1/100th as well as Katie or Tyrone Noonan....damn they can belt it out! Oh, and I felt bad for all the waiters serving the food - they looked insulted when people refused every now and then, as if they'd made it themselves. I wonder if they got paid by the number of items served? In any case, I can vouch for the spring rolls and the hot dogs. Two thumbs up. Thanks to the Machine Gun Fellatio boys for a fun chat - see you at Manning Bar! ;)   urlLink      After Bar Broadway, we headed to Metro to see the last two hours of Spearhead. They were great fun. I got some good dancing in. Big thanks to the dude who managed to spill beer all over my feet and pants...cause my feet were gettiing kinda hot and I just needed a cool down! (Kidding). Note to people who bring big-ass scratchy back-packs to gigs and wear them AND insist on dancing and moving around a lot. Guess what? Every time you feel me, I feel your bag 100x more. I tried to be nice and stick out my elbow a bit to emphasise my presence, but when that didn't work, I kept violently jabbing this dude's bag with my elbow. He kept giving me dirty looks, as if I was getting in the way of his amazing dance moves. Puh-lease. Respect the space of those around you, homeboy! I was just standing there, not moving or dancing (Cause there was no room), minding my own business, but your bastard bag kept knocking me in the arm/head. I ended up moving to the back so I could see and dance and not bother those around me. Gig etiquette! :) Don't worry, I'm not really whinging...I'm laughing too hard to whinge...though I do believe in gig etiquette, yessiree! Michael Franti should sing a song about that...then the people would listen!

        The infamous Mardi Gras photo. Don't try to click on it, that's as big as you're gonna get it, at least from me. :) As usual, Kristen looks sexy and Lori looks about 12. :) Okay, crazy crazy week. Doubt I'll even begin to catch up here...let's re-cap...Monday night was Mowzez's b-day get together, Tuesday I saw Felicity at the Hopetoun with Craig, Wednesday I went with Chad to check out the Beautiful People and some extremely talented musos at L'otel. On Thursday I went to Jo and Steve's for a night of relaxation. Wine, yummy greek salad, breads and dips, jacuzzi, pool, and sauna action. (Thanks so much for your hospitality, guys, you are the best!) Friday I did Tapas with Kristen in Glebe - yum! Saturday Kristen and I ate at Cinques, went to see Mulholland Drive, and then ate at Cinque's again! I had a New York cut steak (yum!) and parmasean mashed  potatoes (double yum!) I was excited because I hadn't had red meat since before Valentine's day and I don't like to go too long without it. So we saw the movie and now I understand why Kristen spent hours on the internet trying to figure it out. It's that kind of a crazy movie. We discussed my guesses and Kristen shared her knowledge of the internet goss on the flick. We headed back to Cinques, got the same waitress who laughed at us  - 'we're back!' and we got pumpkin bread with walnut butter. You could have rolled me home.  Went to bed early - around 1.30am- woo-hoo. I kept having nightmares. And around 5am I woke up from some nightmare - can't remember what - and I was whispering, 'oh my god, we're in trouble!' Then I realised that I felt nauseous. Really nauseous. You know that denial you get when you feel really ill but you try to convince yourself you're not going to be sick? So I tried being in denial for about 10 minutes, then I ran to the bathroom. I was sitting there going, 'No! I can't be sick!' I can't remember the last time I threw up. At least a year and a half, maybe 2 years ago? At least? I can't remember. Anyhoo, I puked about 10 times (aren't you guys glad you're reading this!) and then I took a shower cause I felt so nasty. In the shower, I realise...."Hmmm, I still feel really nauseous" and just hunched over for a half hour and proceeded to puke about 10 more times. Yuck. So I'm guessing it might have been the steak as I hadn't had anything else that was suspect and all I drank all night was coke and water.  The steak  was cooked well and tasted great, but maybe the red meat just killed me. Though it's only been a month since I last had meat. Last time I went several months without red meat, I felt ill after I had some ground beef, but I didn't actually get sick. I'll have to make an effor to eat it more often. Anyway, I'm fine now, just really tired from the whole thing, taking it easy on my tummy. I can't believe I just wrote about puking. Nasty. Sorry about that.  Anyhoo, I got to see Miss Angela this weekend - on her trip home to Sydney for the weekend. It was really good to see her, albeit briefly. I gave her the contact info of a couple Melbourne friends of mine - hopefully they can all go gigging soon!  Tonight, I made the pilgrimage to Yagoona (yes, that's PAST Bankstown, I can't believe it!) via train for Evelyn's birthday dinner. It's a story of all its own and unfortunately my computer is about to die again, so it'll have to wait untill tomorrow, if my computer is working. It took about 14 tries to get it started tonight...which is pretty good these days! Needless to say, Yagoona's finest came out to greet me when I arrived...details to come...  *note to myself, discuss the 'September 11th' book section I saw at the bookstore yesterday...disturbing..

        The Lollie-Lama   That's me, I'm now the Lollie-Lama (not to be confused with the Dalai Lama, as if anyone could....) Last night I treated Shay to some lollies at the Hoyts @ Fox Studios in honour of his birthday on Saturday. On Sat, I was in the Blue Mountains hiking my totally un-physically fit butt off. Anyway, Happy Belated B-day to  urlLink  Shay  and to Owen. We watched Lord of the Rings last night - loved it! I want to live in the Shire in Bilbo Baggins' house! And now that it's legal to love Elijah Wood, life is good...  Happy Belated Easter and all that Jazz.  This is just a quick note to say I'm alive...much catching up to to!

        Panic Room  &  The Fonz   I saw this movie the other day, on Tuesday, and boy can I relate on a totally unrelated level. I feel like I've become my own panic room lately. Okay the scoop this week is that the good ol' 'visa people' sent us a letter saying they're missing this and that. Mind you, they've had over a year to notify us of missing things, but they're like, "We need this and this and this and this and hurry up and get it in within 14 days or buh-bye."  Okay, so you can tell I'm paraphrasing, but still! It's just all rather nerve wracking and that's all I'm gonna say about it. Think good thoughts, people!   Panic Room  the movie definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. I recommend it to all those thriller lovers out there. I always try to put myself in the shoes of the main character - Jodie Foster's character definitely had a nice bit of MacGyver going on. Unfortunately I lack such technique in real life and hence, I would have died in the movie :)  Lots of stuff I've missed blogging about, the chances of me ever catching up are quite slim. Just wanted to reassure you all that I am still alive! And now I'm heading out to dinner but I'll leave you with a short funny little Lori story.  Picture it, Annandale...2002 (doing my best Sofia from Golden Girls' impression)...Lori and crew head to a 'mixed' club, where I think Kristen and I were the only straight people in the place, so absolutely no pick-up lines to worry about really. I cannot emphasise how nice it was to know that no guys were going to hit on us!  And girls might say stuff but they don't just come up to you and start dancing with you against your will. It's all good. Anyway, the club was fun and everyone was really nice and friendly. This one time, I was in the ladies room and I just finished washing my hands and these two girls were blocking the hand-dryer. I said politely, "Excuse me, please" and one of them grinned at me and slammed her elbow into the dryer and turned it on. She smiled harder and said, "Heyyyyyyy, they call me the Fonz!"  I laughed and told her she had great technique....too funny!

        Gig Rage   I just realised tonight that I have Gig Rage. Not road rage, not general impatience, not a broad sense of bitchiness. I am relatively easy going. I've got no stick up my bum. But I do have Gig Rage. It takes a lot to get me mad usually, but holy mother of god did I want to punch out this girl at the Alex Lloyd concert tonight. I went with Kristen and Jorge and a bunch of Jorge's co-workers. Eskimo Joe opened and they were excellent. Very fun, very cute. Even their roadies were cute. Why are all boys from Perth cute? Are they  really  that cute or is it that they are extra cute to me because they're just passing through town and I must only be attracted to guys who aren't sticking around?  I've had some really good dates with Perth boys before. Is it the water in Perth that makes them extra adorable or am I just too twisted and anti-commital to be true? Okay, enough about my fear of commitment....back to the stupid girl I wanted to smack...  So we're half way through Alex Lloyd and he's putting on a great show and we've got plenty of space to move. Crowded, but not claustrophobic. I can dance and not bump into anybody. Life is good. Out of the abyss come these two older beast-women who decide to push their way through the crowd to get closer to their precious Alex. I've said it before and I'll say it again - gig etiquette, people! If you got to the show late, suck it up! Stay in the back. Do NOT push your way through the crowd to stand in front of the diligent people who bothered to get there on time/early. Especially if they're shorter than you are. This is me standing up for the girls who were standing behind me before Beast-Women sprung forth. They were these two really annoying 40-something bleach blonde wannabe groupies who would not shut up. It was a LOUD show and they were chattering away, carrying on a loud conversation, during "My Way Home."  Beast-Woman 1: Oh my god! He's beautiful! I could just die!!!  Me: (to myself)  Could  you?????  Would  you????  Beast-Woman 2: We've got to get closer! I have to tell Alex I love him!  Me: (to myself) Honey, then you should have gotten here before the doors opened like all the good little groupies.  They kept talking. Loudly. I glared at them. Then Beast-Woman 2, who was one of the largest breasted women I've ever seen in my life, started dancing up against me. She was freaking smooshing her breasts into my back and banging up against me, practically grinding me, even. I waited for her to notice and stop. She HAD to have noticed! If I could feel her, she could certainly feel me! I was like, "Are you joking!?" I turned around to give her The Look and she banged into me - it was a full-on breast-slam! I bounced back from the extra spring in her chest. Dear lord, this woman was out of control. This went on for a while and then I started to reclaim my space. I was NOT going to put up with this all night. Mind you, I was not moving, not dancing, not doing anything, just standing there while Dolly Parton kept boobie slamming against me. How did I reclaim my space? The only way I know how - via dancing. I started moving my arms and using my elbows to make space. I kept 'accidentally' jutting out the elbows and ramming into her. Then I started moving my hips and pelvis so I'd knock her out of the way every time I gyrated. Then I started moving backwards. At first she got the hint and backed off, but you know what, I think she liked it, cause she slowly made her way back again, giving me a look like I was the problem. Oh how I wanted to slap her. So I started taking up more room and dancing harder and elbowing her in the boobs.  Finally she and Beast-Woman 1 decided they had to declare their love to Alex. They grabbed each other's hands and decided to try to squeeze past me and the crowd of people in front of me. They were going to sqeeze all the way to the front, up against the stage. Way to piss off a crowd! Way to piss off me. I gave them a dirty look as they went by me and made sure they noticed. Dolly Parton looked at me and smiled and said, "I know, I know, aren't we rude?" I gave her a big forced grin and said, "Yes, you are....." Dolly looked aghast. Her jaw dropped open. What? Like I was supposed to lie and say, "Oh not at all? Everyone here LOVES you for trying to get in front of them!" So while she was busy looking shocked, I smiled a sickly sweet smile and said, "Keep moving" and pushed her firmly out of my way. She looked angry as her friend pulled her along, but I didn't give a damn.  So, I admit it. I have Gig Rage. Is there a 12-step program for this problem? I just find it really funny that pretty much nothing ever gets me angry but a little injustice at a gig and I'm daydreaming about starting a cat-fight. As if I could do any damage to anyone!  Anyhoo, after that brief period of insanity on my part, the rest of the evening was fabulous. Had a super time all around and one of Jorge's co-workers was kind enough to drive me home. No way was Dolly going to ruin my night.  Oh, just one more thing - I was very embarassed by the behaviour of the two dumb girls who climbed on stage during the show. One girl got up on stage before the first encore (while the band was offstage) and grabbed the mic and said, "Don't you all think Alex should sing 'Amazing'?" and then she was quickly escorted off the stage by security. Okay, it was mildly funny and quite ballsy of her to grab the mic, but really, what a waste of time! As if he's not going to play his biggest hit of all time! It's not as if he's got 10 albums under his belt. "Amazing" was voted the #1 song of the Year in the Triple J Hottest 100. It would have been suicide to not play it - the crowd would have rushed the stage. Alex ain't dumb! Of course it was going to be his last song. Doh! Do people not go to enough concerts to notice a little bit of predictability? When someone has two albums to show off, the hits  will  be played, especially THE hit of the year. Nothing is going to top it, so he's going to play it last! The second girl was just sad. She got up on stage during one of his last songs and started dancing behind Alex and then stopped and danced next to him, for about 2 seconds, until security collected her and escorted her off the stage. What a dumb-ass. If you're going to be dumb, be dumb longer than 2 seconds. She walked right into security. Make it worth your while - do a little chase around the stage - give them a challenge - something! The dope was so thrilled at her 'score' that after being kicked off the stage, she ran by Kristen and I, squealing at the top of her lungs and she then stepped on my foot. I was embarassed for all woman-kind. Yes, I understand the whole musician thing is sexy, but let's keep things in perspective, shall we?  "Lucky Star," "Momo," "My Way Home," "Black the Sun," "Green," "Downtown" - very nicely done - very solid set. And surprise, surprise... "Amazing" was played last. Told ya so ;)

        Quotable Chatterbox   If there's something I never run out of, it's things to say and talk about. Yes, I am a big ol' chatterbox. Anybody who knows me knows that. So you can imagine what it must be like to interview me. I felt really bad for the Boston reporter who asked if she could interview me for the  urlLink Bostonia , the Alumni Magazine for  urlLink Boston University  in the States. Poor woman had no idea what she was getting into. You can read the  urlLink article  about Hothouse Productions and  urlLink Small Justice . I've only got a couple tiny snippets in there, but that's not what's meant to be exciting - the documentary is what it's all about, baby!  I have waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too many things to blog about, but I have to get one Croc Hunter bit in here. I'd like to thank Glenn for freaking me out last week by telling me that Steve Irwin (yes, the Crock Hunter) died in a particularly venemous snake bite incident last year. I was horrified. I refused to believe it. And I just read an article about him in the  urlLink Sydney Morning Herald  and am happy to report my favourite little reptilian and amphibian loving spaz is alive and kicking. You've got to read the  urlLink article  though - I nearly peed my pants. I particularly enjoyed the bits about little American kids running around, going up to him yelling, "Crikey!" and "She's a bewdy!" Hahahahahhaha. Classic. My favourite part though had to be Steve's account of what went through his mind when he first met the woman he would later marry...he was giving her a tour of the zoo or whatnot and she whacked her head on a beam and didn't whinge about it...Steve said, ""I thought, 'Crikey, a sheila who loves wildlife and can take a good hit on the head, that's the woman for me!'" Ummmm, yeah, that's romantic! Is this why I've never had a boyfriend in Australia? Because I can't take a good blow to the head? ;)  But as I always say, "Whatever floats your boat." :)  Let's see, super duper quick update...yeah, so last Tuesday was Panic Room viewing, Thursday I had the infamous chicken tandoori pizza dinner with Rammstein and I swear I will never forget that we were there this time! (Shame about my Alzheimers, huh, Rammstein? :) Friday I actually took it easy and stayed in - way too tired to go out. Saturday was Kristen's 23rd birthday and it went off without a hitch, which is amazing for anything with K + I both involved! Seriously, it was a lovely and yummy night with Spanish tapas, flamenco dancers and tiramisu cake!  Happy Birthday, Kristen!   This week has been insane on lots of levels, though I did have a great dinner with David on Monday,  and tomorrow night the whole gang is going to see Alex Lloyd. Saturday we're going to attempt the pilgrimage to Chillis again - dear god may there be no natural disaster this time. I might bring my video camera to record the incidents that are bound to happen.  Special thanks to David H, Steve, David L,  and Doug for really coming through for me this week! You guys rock!

        urlLink    So, what's the Story, Lori?   I've gotten quite a few e-mails lately from friends asking what the hell is going on. To summarise:  1. The 'visa people' demanded more info from us last week. 2. The 'visa people' rang to ask for more info from us this week. 3. Lori had to hassle former supervisors to fax over additional info on the work she did for them (supervisors from Sydney, Boston, New York city) within 24 hours 4. On Friday the 19th of April, Lori receives a letter from the Tenancy Tribunal re: a court hearing for Monday the 2nd of May. Ummm, huh? 5. Lori spends the weekend wondering what the hell the hearing could be about as she's never received anything regarding a hearing before and even the letter about the hearing doesn't indicate what it's all about.  urlLink   6. Lori rings the Tenancy Tribunal on Monday only to be told their computers are down and they can't tell her what the hearing is about either. 7. On Wednesday, Lori finally gets through to the Tribunal who fax her over the official complaint. Apparently Lori's inept real estate agent sent her a notice of eviction at the beginning of February, saying she was over $720 behind in rent. 8. Then the real estate agent filed for a Tribunal hearing because Lori ignored the notice for eviction (Which Lori definitely never received) and continued to live in her apartment after the eviction date (27th of February), thus ignoring her eviction entirely and living there still oweing $720 in rent. 9. Lori is stunned, puzzled, and says, "HUH?" for a long time. Then she thinks, "What eviction notice? $720 behind? How can that be? I pay my rent every month! Why didn't my dumb-ass real estate agent mention 'Hey, how come you're still living in your apartment that we're kicking you out of?' when I went in to grab the apartment keys from him after dropping my set down the elevator shaft?" 10. Lori becomes alarmed that she's speaking in the 3rd person.   urlLink   So that's the gist of what's been happening. Resolutions to all this and more, coming  soon to a blog near you.  *The pics:  The first pic is for B who recently asked what's the longest my hair has ever been. That's it. You can't tell, but it was halfway down my butt. (Um, not a good look for a non-hippie.) The 2nd pic is of me and Andrew. It's your classic role reversal, and breaking down gender barriers. Why can't boys ride the handle bars while the girl pedals, huh? Andrew keeps sending me intriguing little stories from Korea, and it reminded me that I never put this pic up - or did I? I may actually just be losing my mind...The third pic is of me and Angela - likewise, can't remember if I ever put this up - I'm hopefully going to see Angela next weekend in Melbourne...yay! Happy Belated Anzac Day!

        urlLink    Sirs and Madams, I only have time for a Quickie   Last week:  Monday, April 22nd: HUGE thanks to Peter, Gail, and Adrian for coming through for me on such short notice. You guys rock! Wednesday, April 24th: GIGANTIC congrats to Chad on his super bass playing at L'Otel. It was smooth, it was groovy. I would never have guessed he didn't play regularly with the group. Do I sound like a proud mum or what? I hope to see more of you down there at his next performance! Friday: Thanks to the gang for another lovely dinner at the Red Kangaroo. I want to live there! urlLink    Saturday: Happy Belated birthday to Jo, our favourite little gymnast! The Italian food was to die for! I have a funny little old man story. Some elderly man asked me about my hairdo and butterfly clips while I was waiting at the bus stop. He doesn't have the hair to pull it off, sorry! ;)  urlLink   Sunday: Thanks to the umpteenth power to my writer's group. I am feeling very inspired after our last bunch of exercises and I can't wait to see what I come up with this month!  This week: Monday: Experienced Gretel Killeen Rage. (She's the host of Big Brother Australia). Wanted to smack her across the face with her own clipboard, but more about that later.  urlLink   Tuesday: Had the infamous Red Curry Barrimundi with Gavin. We discussed possible names and merchandising for our non-existent band. Jamming and 'recording' to happen. Sometime. :) Wednesday: MEXICAN FOOD! Aye carumba! I've been searching for Mexican food in Sydney for over 3 years (counting my time here in 1998). We went to Cafe Pacifico in East Sydney. Oh. My. God. I nearly cried, the food was so good. Chimichangas....MMMMMMM! Highly recommend. If you want yummy filling food and you like having to be rolled out the door by your friends because you're too full to walk, this is the place to go! Happy B-day to Chris!  urlLink   Today: Had Tenancy Tribunal hearing. In the meantime, I'm not getting kicked out of the apartment, I just have to pay my rent on time (as I do anyway, doh!). Something dodgy is going on though, must investigate further, but all is okay for now. Tonight: Going to see The Church @ the Enmore. Don't think I'll have Gig Rage tonight. In any case, I have a bit of a follow-up to my Gig Rage blurb, inspired by the lovely  urlLink Fidelma .    urlLink    The Photos: From our treks to Bundeena (Royal National Park) and the Blue Mountains. More photos and explanations to be provided when I get a moment (don't hold your breath! :)      urlLink            urlLink     urlLink            As you can see, I've gotten over putting up flattering photos of myself. I look pretty bad in most of these - the honeymoon is over! :)

        Clean-Up On Aisle 9, Please Pick Up the Klutz   As some of you know, I've had a few embarassing incidents at the Broadway Shopping Mall . Well, add Coles to the list of stores I've embarassed myself in. I woke up this morning with that, "Ugh, I'm not getting sick, am I?" feeling. Just felt really tired and sluggish. Anyhoo, by the time I got my butt to the supermarket, I was feeling kind of blah, so the plan was to just get in and out, super quick. Shopping list clutched in hand, I whisked my way from aisle to aisle, making excellent time. I had my purse on my left shoulder and a shopping basket in my right hand. I looked down at my list, while power walking to the 'burrito' aisle and all of a sudden I slipped on some pasta sauce that someone had spilled all over the floor and (which I didn't see, of course) and fell down on the floor. I couldn't have just slipped, or maybe slid a bit and kept going. Oh no, I had to actually fall on the ground. I fell on my right knee, which is of course, the knee I've dislocated twice, and I kind of twisted my left ankle. Let me tell you, don't be fooled by my small frame. I have had a few people over the years tell me I have the 'body of a dancer,' meaning I have a long mini-giraffe like neck, and I'm petite. But let me say, gravity is no one's friend and when I fall, I fall hard, like a sack of potatoes. There's nothing graceful about my klutziness. I love when you fall down and suddenly, there you are on the floor and you get that denial thing happening where you're like, "Maybe no one saw me!" but a quick glance around reassured me that at least 40 people were trying not to laugh at me. Right. So, I was impressed by my recovery time. I got up really quickly and proceeded to walk to the next aisle, as if nothing had happened. Miraculously, nothing had fallen out of my purse or basket.   I scampered away and stood there, spending a lot of time picking out the best burrito sauce, waiting for my face to return to its normal colour when this father and son walk by and say to me, "You know, you don't do something like that unless you're planning to sue."  Without missing a beat, I smiled and said, "Yeah, well, I am American, so they better watch out. I'm thinking about it!" And several people in the aisle started laughing. Yes, I am a Klutz, with a capital K.  p.s. Big shout-out to  Mr. Bart  for the linkage! Check out his site! :-)

       Just got back from Melbourne about 10 minutes ago...left Friday night and got back tonight (late Monlday night Sydney time) and I am ready to collapse. My feet are currently not speaking to me. I saw Angela, Dan, and Dave and met lots of new cool people. I'm ready for bed in every way. Update coming, in the words of Shakira, 'Whatever, Whenever' or something like that...

        Star Wars, Birthdays, Visas, Oh My!   First up, a HUGE thank you to Rammstein for inviting me to the Star Wars Premier at Fox Studios. Lovin' the VIP treatment and seats! More about Star Wars later, but I had such a fantastic time, it was just what the doctor ordered that night!  BIG BIG BIG Happy Birthday to Fan Man aka Chad! (And to his baby brother too!) Sorry, the cake I was supposed to jump out of was run over by a bus. Don't ask... ;-) (I'm kidding, Mum!)  And to those of you wondering what's going on with the whole visa thing - your guess is as good as mine! As soon as I know anything concrete, I'll let you know.  Off to celebrate the birthdays now - yay!  Oh, and I'm finally doing the Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb on Sunday. 'Bout bloody time!  And I'm outtie! (Yes, another pathetic quickie, I know!)

        urlLink    Is This The Last Goodbye? No Way!  Wow. I knew today was going to be hard. And it was. But I am proud of us all. We knew we were going to cry. A lot. And we did, but we really kept the cheery denial thing going until the very end! Our lovely Kristen has flown the coop (cluck! cluck!) , but hopefully not for too long. Kristen and I were up late last night and up early today. We went to the airport with Jorge and Ray. We had random conversations in the car on the way to distract us from getting teary.  urlLink      Thursday Night - Farewell Drinks  Thank you so much to Chad for helping organise the 'do at the Stock Exchange Hotel, which is a very lovely + comfy place, I must say. I only just remembered that I ended up there after my b-day dinner last year while on the way there on Thursday. Too funny. HUGE thanks to Chad,  urlLink Fidelma ,  urlLink Shay , Sal, Damian, Ruth, Andrea, Gavin, Kuan, Rocky & Co. and Jorge and Ray for coming. You guys rock! We had a very fun night and good chats and I might as well plug The  urlLink Sydney Writer's Festival  again for good measure! (p.s.  urlLink Fidelma , if they ever have a suitable competition again, please enter your story - it's a winner! ;)   urlLink    Friday Night - Farewell Dinner  We did dinner at our usual special spot - Wolfies @ the Rocks, Waterfront. Yes, I ordered the kangaroo there again. I can't help it. It tastes just like steak and I must be iron deficient because I've had more red meat this week than I've had in the last 6 months! Dinner was excellent but I nearly smacked our waiter when he came over and asked loudly, "So who's birthday is it?" I turned and gave him a Look. I smiled and said quickly, "Oh, no, it's no one's birthday - this is a farewell dinner, can we order our drinks now, thanks!" Of course the reason why he thought it was a birthday was because I sneaked in to the kitchen and handed him a cake we'd gotten for Kristen.  urlLink   A  surprise  cake. I didn't want this little twerp to ruin the surprise. I excused myself to 'the loo' later on and found him in the kitchen and said, "Hi, just to re-cap, it's the cute blonde at the table who's leaving the country and she doesn't know about the cake, it's a  surprise . He grabbed my hands and winked madly at me and said "Okay, I understand, we'll be very discreet!" The chef came over to me and said they'd stick some sparklers in the cake. Excellent! So I told him, "The code will be, 'Can we see the dessert menus please?' and that's the signal to bring out the cake!"  They agreed. Phew. It all went to plan - yay! And we even made sure Kristen was sitting with her back to the kitchen, so she didn't see it coming. Yay again - the tiramisu cake with the sparklers went off  just as we'd hoped. We ended the night by walking around circular quay, soaking in the gorgeous harbour views.  urlLink   God, this city is beautiful. I think I take it for granted sometimes, so it's good to remind myself of that.   Today - Liftoff  We just love trying to plan surprises at last minute. While poor Kristen was madly packing this morning, I excused myself to go purchase a re-charge card for my phone. Heh heh heh. Well, not really. Jorge, Ray, and I were planning an Aussie care package for Kristen, so we had to organise all our goodies. The care package included Australian jokes, the Homebake 2001 CD, Minties, Cherry Ripe, Picnic Bar, Golden Rough, multiple Cadbury chocolate delights, Dolly Magazine (ha!), a koala-photo filled address book, tasmanian devil stickers, panadeine (you can't get it in the states!), postcards, cards. urlLink    I wanted to stick in Tim Tams, but I knew Kristen would by herself some for the plane, and she did! ;-)  We were going through the motions and all sitting around this little airport cafe pretending that Kristen  wasn't  just about to hop on a plane and fly 11,000 miles away. We knew one tear would create group waterworks. Finally it was time to head towards Kristen's gate. She took some video of all of us hugging and was about to take some pics when Jorge took a gander at the TV screens to see a "Final call" notice next to Kristen's flight number. WTF? It was still over an hour until her flight and they were doing a final boarding call? CRAP! And so that's when the crying began. Panic set in. One second we were all hugging calmly then we get the 'ohmygod, it's the final call' notice and the bawling began. I rarely rarely cry in public, but I just didn't care. Hugs, tears, more hugs, more tears. We just didn't want to let the poor girl go. And then we all hugged and cried, the three of us, as we watched Kristen disappear in the corridor to her gate. :(  Right before we said goodbye, we whipped out the Aussie care package and told Kristen to wait until she was in the air until she opened it. I wanted to put some sweet chilli sauce, vegemite, and a stubby of VB in there, for kicks, but franky, there's just no care package big enough to fit all the stuff we'd have liked to stick in there.   I HATE goodbyes! Anyway, we've decided this is not 'goodbye,' just a 'see you soon' sort of thing. I know what it's like to be missing people on the other side of the world, no matter where you are. It's so tough. But I certainly have no regrets about caring about people all over the globe.

        urlLink    Roach Counts, KFC, Visa Cards, and The Drugs    Roach Counts  You know, I just have to say that the Roach Counts Kristen keeps track of on her blog aren't as amusing anymore now that she's staying with me. :( Yikes! At least I know what I'm getting into when I go home! :-)    KFC Runs  I never go to KFC. I've been there maybe 2x in 2.5 years and I rarely went in the U.S. except for quick mashed potato and gravy and BISCUIT (mmmmmm!) runs, but last night I had a craving. I was walking home from work, though Central and I figured I'd stop at the grocery store on the way home, when all of a sudden the smell of chicken hit me. Must have it! I rang Kristen to see if she wanted anything and I had to hold the phone away from my ear as the poor hungry dear was squealing! 5 pieces of chicken and two tubs of mashed potatoes and gravy later, we were happily full....and thanks to Rammstein, I had to try the Popcorn chicken tonight. Yum!    urlLink    Visa Cards  All you crazy kids and grown-ups (Hi, Auntie Kate!) keep inquiring about the status of ye olde Visa card. You know I love you guys, but I honestly don't have any new news! HUGE thanks to Sal and  urlLink Shay  for being so incredibly sweet, particularly today. I am sincerely touched by your concern and I appreciate your help! You guys rock! :-)   The Drugs  I can't remember if I already blogged about  urlLink The Drugs'   new EP,  The Bold & The Beautiful , probably because I'm senile as all hell, but in any case, it absolutely rocks. I LOVE it - it cracks me up every time and I've heard it about 400 times! You can purchase the single from  urlLink RubberRecords . Excellent value for your money! It's funny and contagious. I also just found out that I'm in the video for the single, "The Bold & the Beautiful." Woo-hoo! It's funny cause I had a dream that I asked if I could be in it, and what do you know? Sometimes dreams do come true! The Drugs are touring VIC now, but they'll be back in Sydney on June 1st @ the Annandale. I highly recommend!  p.s. The pics are from the Bridge Climb we did on Sunday - still have the group photo and the photo with the Opera House behind us coming - how could we resist? Can you beat the view? Can you??? ;)

        urlLink    Chats with Strangers, Writing Exercises, Italian Food, Leisure Suit Larry, and Bridge Climbs   [pssst, the photo is of me and Jorge @ his graduation from UNSW a couple weeks ago - don't I look like the proud mum? ;)]   Birthday Bonanza  Friday night was so much fun!  Chad, all I can say is: You have really nice friends! It was excellent to see  Shay ,  Fidelma ,  Bart , Sal, Amanda, Andy, and the rest of the crew @ Chad's B-day bash, as I hadn't seen them in ages, but what was funny was that I ended up hardly talking to anyone I knew that night and spent most of the night chatting with people I'd never met before. I hadn't intended that to happen and I'm sorry I didn't get to talk to the gang more, but I met some super new people. So thanks to Marvin, Rocky, Mona, Claudine, Ted, Jennifer, and Damian for being so much fun to talk to!  [BIG thanks to Sal for being so incredibly, well, Sal! Her kindness and concern never cease to amaze me.]   Writing Frenzy  I finally turned in my writing piece for the " Can You Survive the Drive?  writing competition for the  Sydney Writer's Festival . The festival runs from the 27th of May to the 2nd of June and there seem to be a lot of cool things happening this year. I decided to enter one of the comps this year simply to use it as a writing exercise. I wanted to give myself a deadline to write a story and while I'm convinced my story is boring as hell after reading it 1000x, I met the deadline and that's all I care about ;)  Thanks to Saint Kristen for helping me time the story - such the little actress!    Italiana!  Jorge, Ray, Kristen and I went to a great Italian restaurant in Leichardt on Saturday. I'll be damned if I can remember the name - it might have been Alba's? I seem to remember reading the name of the restaurant upside down on the bill. This funny woman with long painted finger nails and tight snake-skinned pants serenaded us with Italian and French songs on the accordion. It was very good, albeit loud. I was impressed she could play the keys or chords with those nails and I could hear my old piano teacher whispering in my ear, "Cut your finger nails, Lori!"  The old woman threw a fit if she could hear my nails hit the keys. ;) Anyway, the food was amazing - just what I needed. I hadn't had red meat in ages and I was craving steak so badly, so I was such a happy camper!   Leisure Suit Larry   Is there a conspiracy going on here? At first I thought I was the only person who had never heard of  Leisure Suit Larry , but so far it seems like it's mostly a guy thing. I might be totally wrong, so if there are girls out there who played this game, please let me know! Anyway, thanks heaps to Rammstein for being so sweet as to burn me a copy of Leisure Suit Larry 1-6! I'm so psyched. I popped it in when we got home last night and I LOVE it! I haven't gotten very far yet as I only had it in for like 20 minutes, as I couldn't figure out how to turn off the sound so as not to disturb poor sleeping K,  but I can tell I am going to become addicted. It is hilarious! As Rammstein said, I will learn to love the polyester! I am going to make up for lost time now as from everything I've heard about LSL, it sounds so fricking funny - I feel very deprived. Just call me Leisure Suit Lori! :-)   The Bridge Climb   "Now I've....had the climb of my life.....no, I never felt this way before, yes, I swear, it's the truth, and I owe it all to you..." Finally. It's only taken me two years, but I finally did the Sydney Harbour  Bridge Climb . It was fantastic! My lord is this thing organised! I've never seen a more organised tour in my life, and I've been on plenty of tours in my day. I felt like I was in some NASA training camp, getting ready to become an astronaut! So they were extremely thorough and thought about absolutely everything - there was absolutely nothing that could go wrong! And everyone who worked there was unbelieveably nice and funny. Really friendly and hilarious, without being annoyingly perky. Our bridge climb guide Anne, was so cool! She reminded me a lot of my friend Zoe.   The only drama we had was getting to The Rocks. Kristen and I caught a bus from Broadway and it took over a half hour to get there due to heavy traffic...we ran and ran once we got off the bus and just made it right on time. Phew! So, first we watched an instructional video and then we were herded into room where we had to sign a form saying we were in reasonable health and wouldn't sue anyone if anything happened. They had us take breathaliser tests to make sure no one was drunk. Hee hee. Then we were all given our jump suits which were oh-so-stylish. Seriously, compared to the flightsuit I had in New Zealand when I did my first sky-dive (I looked like a pregnant human banana!), I felt like a big ol' fashion plate! The jump suits were not bad at all. Then we got our gear - our harnesses, and our "parachutes" which turned out to be fleece jackets. Then we were off to get our "accessories," which turned out to be gloves, beanies, cords for glasses/sunglasses, and handkerchiefs. Hahahaha - yup, they even had hankies for us! How funny was that. Anne told us, "yeah, try to get a clean one!" She was kidding. The hankies, gloves, beanies (hats), absolutely everything had bands on them that went around our wrists like bracelets and could then be stuffed up our sleaves. Everything was attached to us or our suits somehow, so there was no way in hell anything could fly away. Finally, we each got radios and ear pieces so our guide could talk to all of us during the ascent and descent. "Astronaut Lori, can you please make your way to lift-off?"  Seriously, I was so excited - I felt like a little kid walking around in astro-gear!   I don't know how I got to be first in line to follow our guide, but I did. I didn't think having the Super Klutz be the first to climb, but maybe I would show the team what NOT to do! As it turned out, I didn't do anything klutzy or embarassing, so all was well. The beginning which involved climbing up several ladders was a bit odd because only one person is allowed on the ladder at a time so my guide ran up the first ladder and disappeared and then I went next but she wasn't on the next level so I was like, "Umm, do I just keep going?" So I did, but there was no one ahead of me or behind me that I could see while I was climbing. When I got to the top, I looked at Anne who had flown up the stairs and said, "You little show off, you!" And she laughed.    The majority of the climb was easy as pie. It's simply going up and down stairs. You have your harness on the whole time, but really, there's no way you could fall off the bridge without the harness unless you were trying. You'd literally have to be trying to jump off. I felt very safe the whole time. Obviously, the view was absolutely amazing. Of course, my harness ring kept getting stuck through every little divet we went through, but I was able to pull my way free in about 1 second, so no problem. Now, to be honest, the Bridge Climb is NOT cheap. Pretty pricey, but the Sydney Harbour has to be the best damn harbour in the world, and you only live once, so why the hell not? I couldn't stop gaping at the scenery below. I've seen it all before, from the ground, and even from a helicopter, but this was still just as breath-taking as ever.   We had our pics taken and you'll be able to see the embarassing and highly unflattering pics of me very soon. It was very windy up there, winds reaching around 40kph, and we felt like we were going to fly off the bridge. Anne told us to stand and lean against the wind and put our arms out to simulate  sky-diving . And it did really feel an awful lot like  sky-diving . Very cool!  So, all in all, it took about 2 hours (plus an hour of prep time)  but it just flew by. We learned a lot of history about the bridge and the making of it. We waved to George, the poor bridge-worker who is still buried within the bridge. He slipped and fell into some cement and wasn't discovered till he was buried to his forehead. There was nothing they could do, so they kept on pouring. So poor George is still a fossil within the bridge today. Something like 16 people out of about 1461 lost their lives in the making of the bridge during the Depression. Considering they had no safety precautions, I find that to be amazing. And we learned about this Irishman who fell off the bridge into the harbour and survived, but his boot soles pressurised into his feet and had to be surgically removed. The highest parts of his boots actually melded into his groin and also had to be surgically removed. Ouch! He had lots of internal injuries and broken ribs and whatnot, but he was back at work in about 3 weeks. What a trooper!   Anyway, you get the point - had an awesome time and I'm so glad we went. If you want a reminder of how beautiful Sydney is, give it a whirl! Afterwards, we went to City Extra for dinner - yum! So even though I had Fish & chips and bread and salad and  an ice cream sundae, about a half hour later when we get home, I am starving. I just made myself 2 corn on the cobs - gotta love it!  Lastly, I just want to send lot of love and prayers to Heather and the Downies. My thoughts are with you guys - please stay strong!

        The Drugs Do Work   Congrats to The Drugs! I just got confirmation from their lovely Record Label Gal that The Drugs are going to appear on Rove Live on July 2nd with Ridge from  The Bold & the Beautiful  with their brand-spanking new single "The Bold & the Beautiful," surprisingly enough.  Be sure to check 'em out on Rove and there's lots going on in Sydney tomorrow night, but my pick is still The Drugs @ the Annandale.   This weekend is finally the  urlLink Sydney Writer's Festival  which I bet some people are sick of listening/reading me blog about all the damn time.. Don't worries, kiddies, it'll be over by Monday. ;-) Looking forward to it!  Tomorrow our friend Lisa arrives from the States. Just when one little Boston Uni Yankee leaves, another one arrives. We've got a constant flow of Yankees here! Watch out, Australia, we're multiplying.   Off to meet some friends for drinks now, I think. I say "I think" because I'm currently sitting nice and comfy and warm on my couch and the longer I stay here, the less likely I am to move. :)

        The Little Addict + Obedience   Two things.. 1. I am now addicted to Leisure Suit Larry. I can't stop playing! 2. Found a nice article reminding us all about the amazing  urlLink Stanley Milgram , the social psychologist who proved what no one would have believed otherwise. The way we influence each other and are influenced by one another, particularly by people in authority - it's freaking scary!

        Thank You!   I guess I have known it for a while, but this last week has made me remember and appreciate even more: I have awesome friends and family. I love you guys very much and thank you to everyone. You all rock! I will post pics from Friday and from tonight (after they're taken!) and will give a lowdown of what went on, but just a quickie to say thank you all for coming down to The Rose last night - I had a fabulous time! And huge thanks to some very special folks who were there in spirit (In San Fran, Paris, New Hampshire, Sydney, Springfield, Dublin etc) - will give proper thank you list later!  Happy birthday (today) to my cousin Jeff, from his 'older and wiser ' cousin Lori ;-)

        urlLink    Happy Birthday, To Me!   "Happy Birthday to Me! Happy Birthday to Meeeeee! Happy Birthday dear Meeeeeee-eeeee! Happy Birthday to Meeeeeeee! Any many more......"    oh yeah - I'm in Oz, "Hip hip - hooray!" x 3 :-)  So that's my first official birthday pic, taken precisely at midnight. Though I'm not technically 25 until 8.04am...and I was born in the States, so, I've got a ways to go, but close enough, dammit. I can no longer tick that young, safe 18-24 year-old age bracket on forms anymore! I've been bumped up to the 25+ category.  Do I look any older? The real question is, could I look any younger? I could be 14, geez!  Things I thought while taking b-day photo: 1. Boy is it cool having a new digital camera! 2. Boy is it hard to take a picture of myself. 3. Dear god, my head is big. 4. Could my face BE any rounder? (a la Chandler Bing) 5. Thank you to my orthodontist. 6. Why do I always look drunk in photos? I had a can of Coke tonight. And water. That's it 7. Holy cow, are my lips really that big? I think I have intimidating lips. Maybe that drunk girl @ the Glenmore Hotel was right. (Only  Fidelma  and Jorge will really appreciate this.)  Happy Birthday to Tim (you're only older by 4 hours, so don't get too cocky!) and Dave (you're still a baby, baby!) and to Auntie Nancy (still 35, huh? ;-)  Hope to see you guys tonight!  p.s. It is impossible to embarass me about my birthday, so don't even try! Does that sound like a dare? ;-)

        Early Birthday Present & 'Old Skool Music'   Wow, today was a funny day. I arrived at work to find a package on my desk. I assumed it was something for  Yap . CDs or games or something. So I open it up. And what is it, but an early birthday present. My jaw dropped open. It was a digital camera from the Prak-Man. I am still in shock. Thank you, Prak-Man, though I'm going to pay you back whether you like it or not! :-)  So I'm currently trying to figure out how to use my new digital camera. I hate manuals of any kind so I'm gently pressing all the buttons. I've taken a few pics but no luck getting them of the camera yet. And I don't think the battery is fully charged yet. Probably just leave it over night....so excited about the new toy!  I spoke to my favourite travel agent today and she's on the hunt for prices for my desired destination. I don't want to say where I want to go yet, for fear of jinxing it. I most likely will not be able to afford it, but here's hoping! I should know something more definite tomorrow.  Today and yesterday I brought my walkman to work. When I told my coworkers I'd brought it in they looked at me blankly for a second. "You know, so I can play audio tape cassettes?" More blank stares. "Oh yeah! Tapes!"  Hehehe :-) I brought in my 'Butterfly In Oz' mix of songs that were important/funny/significant to those of us who spent 6 months in Sydney on the Boston University program. Here's the tracklist (from memory):  "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" - U2 (The theme song of Lori and Jorge!)  "Sweet Dreams" - Eurythmics (It was thanks to this karaoke number that I suddenly became popular with 70 Americans and various Irishman at St. Patricks)  to be continued...

        Change of Plans & Birthday Plans   Well, well, well. It's amazing how in the blink in the eye, the ring of the telephone, the press of a few keys, everything you thought was happening is completely turned upside down. Only yesterday I was telling a friend what the deal with my visa situation is. We're withdrawing my current visa application and applying for a different one. Long story, but it seems the best thing to do. The bonus of withdrawing the current visa and lodging another application straight away was that I wouldn't have to leave the country. Well, that's what I thought. This morning I get a call from my lawyer. He says, "Are you sitting down?"  Oy. I say I'm sitting down. He says, "So if you could go to another country for a bit, where would you go?"    I'm thinking I have to leave the country briefly and come back in so I venture, "Well, New Zealand's closest, I guess."   And he says, "Well, what about the States?" He then explains that I have to get out of the country for 3-4 weeks. Not entirely sure why, but immigration is being stubborn and they insist I leave the country. So...I'm beginning to wonder if that letter my father has been writing to immigration telling them to kick me out actually made it into someone's inbox.   So the deal is the company's part of the application is submitted first, then Lori has to take a holiday and come back on a business ETA visa and my part of the application is lodged while I'm out of the country and we'll all live happily ever after? I hope so! First of all, my bosses were extremely understanding of the whole having to leave the country thing, which was super of them. I mean, it's a bit of a shock to have an employee say, "Oh, by the way, I need to leave the country for a month, do you mind?"  I haven't left Oz in over 18 months, so obviously I've been thinking about going home at some point, but was intending on waiting until everything was sorted out....the best laid plans...  Anyway, I have to get out within 28 days, so I have to take off by end of June. Now, I know one of my lovely Aunts reading this is freaking out as she realises what I am saying. Yes, I have to leave at the end of June and I know that she and my uncle and the kids will be on holiday at that time, but I have no choice. Ideally I'd like to take a quick trip to somewhere other than just Springfield/Boston. This is in no offense to my family or friends back home, it's just that I haven't had a holiday in a long while and it would be nice to have a little mini-vacation AND see my family/friends as well as long as I have to leave anyway. Of course I'm not exactly wealthy so I can't just go off jet-setting, but I'm going to get some prices on a couple crazy places I have in mind. Probably won't happen, but we'll see. I chatted with my parents online tonight and they were excellent. They're already planning to take me gambling at their favourite casino...hehe :-) So, Auntie Kate, if you haven't passed out yet, I'm thinking of trying to have that mini-break before I get to Springfield so you won't miss much of my visit - probably only a couple of days. In any case, relax, we'll see each other and have plenty of time to go shopping :-)   So yeah, there's a lot to think about and plan and we've still got the actual application forms and other requirements for the visa to get through...  SO in the meantime, a minor detail called my birthday is coming up. This Friday, June 7th,  I turn the big 25. I've been so distracted by everything that I've neglected to actually tell anyone what's going on. Don't ask me how my birthday is going to be 'celebrated' on two nights. I don't know how this happened or why. I'm not freaking Prince after all (we share the same b-day.) But anyway, there will be birthday drinks this Friday at The Rose in Chippendale and on Saturday there will be dinner followed by some sort of activity (dancing perhaps?) at a restaurant/club TBA. I swear I will actually decide where tomorrow. So if anyone wants to come along to anything, please do. Drinks from 7pm on at The Rose on Friday and if anyone wants to come to dinner or just whatever's happening after dinner on Saturday, let me know. Feel free to pop into anything whenever. I already have plans to have belated birthday drinks/dinner next week with various friends who are going away this weekend, the long weekend. As ever, I'm the Queen of Bad Timing! :-)

         Presenting Lori Croft in 'RoomRaider - Along Came a Spider'    It's Official!   I'm going places! Woo-hoo! Okay, so I'm going to spend my entire tax refund before I get it, but hey, I'm used to being poor! I leave for the States on June 24th...and then jaunt off to Europe briefly to see Rachel and Anthony in Paris (will try ringing you guys in the morning!) and Javier in Barcelona. I'll only be in Europe for a little over a week. Then it's approximately 3 weeks in Springfield...with visits to Boston/New York. I can't believe it. I paid for the tix today, so no turning back now. I'm destined to be poor, but I'm okay with that! I have had an obsession with Picasso for the past few years and to think that in a few weeks I will be at the Picasso Museum, I've got chills. And I've been obsessed with Monet for several years (many of my songs have references to Monet), so you can imagine my excitement. I can't wait to see Rachel, Anthony, and Javier - so cool to have the opportunity to see them all in such a short period of time. There's lots to do and sort out before I leave though, oy!   Do you like this dodgy 'Lori Croft' pic? It's all Rammstein's idea. He suggested 'Lori Croft' and 'RoomRaider' and the cans of Mortein and everything. Thanks for the inspiration, Rammstein! It's verrrrrrry poorly done, but I think it's funny and not tooooo pathetic for a 20 minute procrastination break. And yes, that does look like the spider that was in my living room. (Feeling my family in Springfield shudder from here.) As my mother pointed out in a recent e-mail, "You have jumped out of two planes, you should not be afraid of a spider."  True, Mum, but alas, phobias are not logical. :-) I am a wuss, I know!

        And Along Came A Spider...   Oh. My. God. I am such a wuss. I am a big baby when it comes to spiders. One of my life-time phobias. It's stupid and irrational, but that's what phobias are, stupid and irrational. So I came home from a pretty nice and relaxing Monday around 6pm. Something caught my eye on the couch. I frowned as my brain tried to make out what this thing was. Immediately I thought that it was a bunch of the fake plastic spiders that came with my new "Croc Hunter" doll, a birthday present from Rammstein. I scratched my head and thought, "But, I didn't leave them on that couch..." So I take a step closer to the couch....and gasp....and scream bloody murder! Just one big scream. My neighbours probably thought that I was being murdered or attacked by a banshee. I threw my bags down on the floor and start muttering expletives under my breath. I grab my mobile and ring Jorge and Ray. "*#@%! There's a #&^-ing spider the size of my hand on my couch! Oh my god! It's huge, it's hairy, it's creepy, bigger than my hand!" So Jorge and Ray are laughing at me, of course, and ask what I'm going to do. I say I will kill it, but am procrastinating from killing it by ringing them. The spider is moving ever closer to my fleece jacket. Ew! Ray tells me to kill it with a shoe, but it's on my soft squishy couch. If it were on a hard surface, I'd have a shot. Spiders are creepy - they're hard to kill, when small. They roll up into a little ball and refuse to die. This is the biggest one I've ever seen IN MY HOUSE. I don't give a damn about spiders outside or at other people's houses, but in my house - I'm a wuss! So I tell Jorge and Ray I'm going to "take care of business" and will ring them back when I've taken care of the beast.   So, armed with two cans of Mortein, I head towards the couch. I could barely even look at it. Why am I such a baby? I'm TWENTY FIVE!  It's just a spider. Anyway, I start spraying madly. The spider is NOT impressed. It starts running across the couch and tries to hide in the sleeve of my jacket. Yuck. So I spray more. My couch, jacket and spider are soaked in Mortein. Half a can of Mortein later, the spider gives up, folds into a ball and dies. Yuck, yuck, yuck. Going to have to wash the sheets on the couch, and my poor jacket. So I ring Jorge and Ray to tell them I've done it. They laugh at me some more. Jorge says, "I've never heard you so worked up before, EVER!"  I sigh and say, "I know, I'm a nut! They just freak me out!"    Jorge: "It was probably just a Huntsman." Lori: "How do you know? I don't know what's what!" Jorge: "Don't worry, it was probably a Huntsman." Lori: "Are those poisonous?" Jorge: "Umm, no..." Lori: "Are you just making this all up?" Jorge: "Umm, yeah, I actually don't know...." Lori: "Oh god!"  What's funny is that if someone else had been here, I probably wouldn't have freaked out so much. I get much braver when other people are around, especially people who hate bugs/insects/whatever more than I do. Like, certain members of my family are terrified of spiders and even though I don't like them either, if there's one in the house when they are around, the more they freak out, the calmer I become and I'm able to dispose of the spider, with very little fear. What's up with that???? Maybe I should do a study on that - people who are able to overcome their fears when those around them become scared.    I just hope that there are no "friends/loved ones/relatives" of the spiders hanging around. Otherwise, I take pity on my neighbours, cause there's going to be a whole lotta screaming going on!

        Bon Voyage, Almost   Thanks to Ruth, Jorge, Ray, Glenn, Luke, David, Darren, Matthew, Damian, and Lisa for coming along to my 'farewell' dinner @ Flavour of India in Glebe. I had the Lamb Korma. Yum! I'm sure everyone is sick of me and all Lori-ed out from the past few weeks, but I appreciate the effort :-)  Tomorrow I have to ring my lawyer to find out all the bits I have to do for my visa application and I have to finally go and pick up my plane tickets. Oh yeah, I should start packing soon ;-)

        Here's Lookin @ You, Mum!   Happy birthday to my Mum! Congrats, Mum, you are finally 35! You made it! I hope you have a super b-day and I will be seeing you  very  soon! - Love, Lori (your favourite - and only - daughter)  ;-)   WOO to the HOO!   It's been great fun trying to get lots of work done at work before my departure, sorting out immigraton paperwork, planning trains and accommodation in Europe, trying to pack and clean my apartment, all while not knowing for sure whether or not the whole visa thing was even going to happen. *Cue Aerosmith  Livin' on the Edge  music.* And thank you to all those doubting-toms who asked me things like, "Are you going to give up the apartment?" "What if you can't get back in the country?" What if the visa doesn't work?" Look, I'm a glass is half-full sorta gal, so believe me, it's not like I hadn't thought of those things and I love you all for caring, but I have to just keep plodding along like everything will work out in the end, and it usually does.    The good news is that I just found out that my company's nomination (of me) has been approved! YAY! That means I can now officially apply for my visa - well, I can once I'm in the States. You can't even apply for the visa if the nomination is rejected. So half the battle has been won. Hence, WOO to the HOO!  Going to celebrate by seeing  Spiderman  tonight with Graeme. Weeee!

        La Noche de Nachos   Huge thanks to Ruth for having me over for dinner tonight. We had yummy nachos and wine and nachos and more wine. Ruth can talk as much as I do, if that gives you any indication of the great chat session we had. :-) It was a good night of gossip! I was telling Ruth about this poem I wrote yesterday. It's in Spanish and the English translation is SO cheesy, but of course it sounds nice in Spanish. It's probably not all correct, but I think most of it is okay. I had my first dream in Spanish ever two nights ago and I woke up yesterday morning and wrote about it. It's a sad poem about a fisherman who has never known love before. I'll post it here, soon. I think :-)  Sueos felices!

        Writing Weekend, Chatty Sunday   Had an amazing weekend down in Kiama with my Writer's Group. I love those gals! It was a weekend full of writing, chatting, gossip, more writing, writing exercises, good food, tea and biscuits, wine, and walks along the beach. Kendall Beach is gorgeous. I highly recommend. This is just a quicky to say the birthday pics are just about ready to go, I've just been too slack to put them up live yet.  Just got home from Kiama this arvo and then I went to see my friend Bonnie's blues band play in Newtown. She is fantastic! Lisa and I ran into Graeme there and I've been meaning to catch up with him for ages. We ended up at The Townie with Nick and Deb, two funny characters. Deb asked me about 5 times how I met Graeme. It was hilarious because she mentioned the movie  Memento  at one point and that's exactly what talking to her was like. I should have started making up crazy stories about how I met Graeme. Anyway, we didn't get to hang with Bonnie long, but she was fabulous and we'll catch up soon. Lisa, Graeme, Nick, Deb, and I had one hilarious conversation after another. Nick first greeted me with a "I know you from somewhere!" and I said, "Yup, you've driven me home before!" (Get your minds out of the gutter, it wasn't like that!) Sydney is such a small small world!   To Rachel and Ant, I am so sorry I missed you once again! I will actually try again to call you tomorrow or the following day!   Happy Belated B-day to Uncle Sean. I will make it up to you, I promise :-)

        Bonjour, Paris!   Okay, so I lied! If you want to say hi,  urlLink butterflynet@ekno.com  is a much better e-mail address to use as it takes ages for me to access the messages for the other account as it forwards to my work account, which is so big, I could go eat lunch and come back and it would still be loading up. My bad.  Yes yes, (oui oui!) it's disgusting that I am in an internet cafe in Paris, but I have just been walking non-stop for 5 hours, so I think I deserve a little sit-down. And if I just happen to sit down in front of a computer with internet access, so be it! :-)  So I arrived in London last night, safe and sound. I was sitting in the middle of the middle, in between a mother and son. I ended up talking to them about colleges - the son is just looking at schools now and Boston University and Brown are two that he is looking at, so I had lots to say on that subject! I met a really cool girl waiting in line for the luggage/ticket check-in at JFK airport and we knew so much about each other after that hour, let me tell you. We bonded over stupid people who had to re-pack their stuff at the counter! I also met a really kind woman on the Heathrow Express train to Paddington and scored a free taxi ride to the train station close to my hostel. I have quite the mixed review on my hostel, Ashlee House, but more about that in a later blog. No, unfortunately, I have not met any cute boys yet (except for the cute soul who pointed to the buzzer on hostel door in London when I stood there like an idiot, pulling and pushing on a non-budging door.)  But I am hopeful :-)  So, I took the train from London to Paris today. Sat next to a nice Italian man from London - he assured me I'd be okay with my minimal (read: non-existent) French. I totally planned to study my French phrases book both on the plane to London and on the train to Paris, but I dozed off both times. Ooops! I at one point figured out how to say I was originally from the United States but currently live in Australia. I have, of course, forgotten that now. Sigh...I want to make an effort though----I certainly won't be the first or last person to murder the beautiful French language.  So, Rachel met me at the train station today and took me to her and Anthony's apartment which is lovely. So grateful I am staying with them. Rachel had to go to work, so I've been walking around for the last 5 hours. Paris is amazing. So beautiful, so grand, so cool! I did the Lonely Planet walking tour today and took way too many pics of the Bastille and Notre Dame, etc. etc. but I couldn't help it. I am going to go to the Picasso Museum tomorrow morning and then I think we're going to go see a bit of the country-side tomorrow. Monday will be my big museum day! Beautiful day in Paris today - love the old buildings, the cafes, etc. I feel like I'm walking around in a fairy tale.  Well, I better sign off - have been keeping a journal, so will add longer entries later! I will be here until Monday night - then I take the overnight train to Barcelona!  Au revoir!  p.s. Big happy birthday in advance to the lovely  urlLink Fidelma  for the 30th of June. Hope you have a great one, my dear! :-)

        Hola, Barcelona!   Wow time is just flying by...Ahorita estoy en la ciudad hermosa de Barcelona...well, right now I am in the beautiful city of Barcelona. I am hoping my Spanish will improve while here! And I swear I was not intenting to go into an internet cafe, but I literally just stumbled upon this one - do I have some sort of cyber radar? Luckily I only run into them when my feet are about to fall off from all the walking Ive been doing. Today I had a lazy day  - bad Lori!   I arrived into Barcelona around 11.30 am after taking a 12 hour train from Paris. I got one of the sleeper train beds (for 16 extra, you can bet your bottom dollar I was going to get a bed and not sit on my ass for 12 hours (itd be like the flight from Sydney all over again and Ive made a deal with my ass -- no long term sitting sessions till I get back on that flight to Oz!) The beds were...interesting -- 6 bunk beds together in a cabin. I hightly recommend them as its way more comfortable to lie down for 12 hours than to sit, but I just have one question -- why are bunk beds anywhere in the world incapable of allowing you to sit up in them? Why are they always designed so that no matter how short you are, you will never be able to sit up straight? You will always crack your head on them!  Anyhoo, I will write more about Paris after I get back to the States probably. Ive kept a journal, so will type it in from Springfield, MA. In the meantime, had a lazy day in Barcelona today. I did not flirt with a single guy in Paris, but within about 5 minutes of arriving in Barcelona I found myself a cute lunch date. Go figure! We went to a nice little place and had tapas for 4 hours. Okay, now to other things that wont make my parents cringe...  Looking forward to a long day of walking and sight-seeing tomorrow. I will plan a walking route in the morning. I like to wander around and hit the cool things along the way.  My hostel room is pretty good - I have my own bathroom and shower, which is pretty sweet as no one else in the building has to see me look like crap in the morning. :-)  Note to self: Schedule foot transplant from all the walking Ive been doing.  Oh! How could I forget my embarassing story! I arrived at my hostel, trying to be cool and only speaking Spanish. It almost worked. The woman gave me the key and I thought it said 510, so thats what room I went to. The door opened, I stashed my stuff inside, locked the door then looked for the shower as I was sweating like a pig. Went back to room, tried to open door, no luck. Went back to reception to explain my key wasnt working. She gave me another one. It didnt work. Thats when I met my lunch date. He tried to help me open the door. No luck. As I was about to go back downstairs I realised what had happened. I replayed the conversation with the woman over in my head. In Spanish I thought she said to go past the TV room, but then I realised she said THROUGH the TV room, so sure enough I go through the room and theres a hidden door, and then a roof, then another door....and a hallway...and there is my real room. Not room 510 but room 514. Doh. The key worked  but all my stuff was still locked inside room 510. So I had to go downstairs and explain what happened in Spanish-English and admit I am a dumbass and ask for the key to 510 so I could get my bags out and move them to 514. She was very nice. I think she felt sorry for me for being a dork!

        Sam, I Am, I Like Green Eggs & Ham, And to Think That I Saw it On Mulberry Street   I went to the National Dr. Seuss Museum today...Good ol' Springfield Massachusetts, U.S.A. is the birthplace of Dr. Seuss (Children's author of  The Cat in the Hat ,  How the Grinch Stole Christmas  etc), so I moseyed on down to the Museum and the Springfield Quadrangle today to check out the exhibits and sculptures which have only been around since June 1 this year. The sculptures of Dr. Seuss characters are pretty damn cool and kids couldn't help climb all over them despite the signs reading, "Please don't climb on the sculptures" and though the actual exhibits all fit in one (not particularly huge) room, there is a ton of information and cool bits and pieces packed in there. I took lots of notes and pictures, so expect something fairly informative and hopefully interesting coming to a butterfly blog near you soon...I remember in elementary school we had to go down to Springfield's Mulberry Street and write down what we saw (real or imagined) on the same street Dr. Seuss wrote about. Who knew that 20-odd years later I'd be taking notes on Dr. Seuss's life!  I was struck today by how funny perspective is when you're growing up, and how much it changes. When driving home past my old elementary school today, I remember when I was a kid, I actually thought the school was so far away...it is literally like a 10 minute walk, if you're taking your time. But when you're short and small and have little legs and you need a crossing guard to get you across that first street, I guess it seems like a big deal. The monkey bars/jungle gym and slide are still there...they used to tower over me...how many chicken fights did I take part in (and win!) on those monkey bars? And standing next to them now, I'd feel like a giant. The school is surrounded by what used to be 'mountains'...my dad and I went sledding down those 'mountains' in the snow and ice and literally smashed into the school once...ooops, but now those mountains are just small hills.  The school used to seem like this gigantic fortress, and looking at it now, I feel like a kid staring into the windows of a dollhouse. When I was a kid, I never thought about the possibility of outgrowing my world.   Okay, you guys can stop gagging now, I will stop with the nostalgia. ;-)  I've got a nice family get-together/pool party to look forward to tomorrow. My poor family. Between my 'hundreds' of pics of Paris and Barcelona and my Aunt's 'thousands' of pics of Disneyworld, they're never going to want to look at photos again. ;-)

        Dictators, Sitcom Stars, Oh My   I got sent this link today. Too funny. It's called "Guess the Dictator or Television Sit-Com Character." You just pick someone in your head, answer some questions and they'll take a  urlLink wild guess . I've done about 7 people and they're right every time! Yeah, so I haven't gotten much work done, in case you couldn't tell. ;-)

        Pulling a Sickie   Warning: This is a very gross entry!  I have this amazing ability to get sick when I'm on holiday. So the day after I get back from Europe I wake up at the ass crack of dawn, feeling surprisingly good. What jetlag? I have some cereal at 8am, then am starving and can only wait till 10.30am for lunch. I start to feel extremely lethargic and hop in the shower. I start to feel nauseous. Not good. So after having a very productive morning of doing all my holiday laundry, and trying to impress my parents by doing their laundry too, I spend the remainder of the day laying down on my parents' new lazy boy chair, trying not to move. I was intending on doing some work work, for work, but rubbing my tummy became an all consuming task. Pathetic. I spent all afternoon willing myself to feel better as I was supposed to go out to dinner with my parents and my grandfather, and I was thinking of making myself go, and just sipping soda and not eating, but thank goodness I didn't. The retching began right around when we would have been arriving at the restaurant and continued for the next 6 hours. I couldn't even keep a couple sips of coke/ginger ale down. Nasty!  Then began the classic mother-daughter debate. My mum, being a very concerned mum, was worried that I didn't have any fluids in me and kept trying to get me to drink something, but I knew that whatever I had to drink would not be staying in my body for very long, so why bother? I thought my stomach just needed to be completely empty so that there was absolutely NOTHING that could prompt any more retching...I wanted to try to fall asleep.  So I dozed off and woke up at 3am, 4am, 5am, finally got out of bed at 5am....wanted some tylenol to cure my achiness (equivalent of panadol) but was afraid it wouldn't stay down.   Anyhoo, I think the worst is over...I might actually try some toast in a few hours - woo-hoo! Though I did just suffer some lovely humiliation. I'm sitting here in the kitchen, typing on the 'puter and my next door neighbour comes over to the window and says, "Oh, hi, Lori! Are you home for good this time?" I say I'm only home for a few weeks, and that I'm heading back to Oz at the end of July. She looks at me hard and says, "So, you're happy there?" And I said that I am definitely still enjoying Sydney. And she says, "Well, that's what matters then. As long as you're happy."  Yup.  She had come over to turn off our sprinklers. I was trying not to laugh at her gaping, her utterly shocked expression. In short, this is the worst condition she has ever seen me in. I look like death. Pale and nasty, I'm talking NO LIPSTICK here people (note, that's how you know I'm really sick, when I can't even put the tube to my mouth!) and my hair is one big dreadlock/knot at the moment. WHY did she have to come over right then? It's 8am!!! She's probably going to go home and tell her husband, "Gee, I don't think Australia is agreeing with Lori, she's looks like total crap!"   Apologies for writing about puking instead of my Lori National Lampoon's European Holiday, but I had to get my humiliating neighbour story out of the way....

        Bonjour, Springfield! Hola, Springfield!   Back in the States now. I got up this morning at 7.30am. Got home around 11.30pm last night. Took the train from Barcelona to Paris on Monday for 9 or so hours, then yesterday I took the train from Paris to London at 7am, got to London and found my way around the tube, easy as pie....well, easy except for my damn big backpack which only got heavier as time went on. I highly recommend the Heathrow Express. It's pricey (12 pounds), but dammit it's worth it if your back is crying and you're tired and sweaty and just want to get to the airport. It's only a 15-20 minutes ride to the terminals from Paddington Station. So I only had to go from Waterloo to Baker Street and then change lines to get to Paddington, and then get to the Heathrow Express line. Not bad at all. I would like to blame my jet-lag for just writing that really boring paragraph...(Inner dialogue: Lori, who the hell cares what trains you took yesterday?)  Ah well, I thought I was going to get off easy with this jet-lag thing, but all of a sudden I'm really sleepy now....I might go back for a nap. I'm trying to stay up though...have lots of work emails to catch up on, heaps of laundry to do....I want to burn all my clothes from Europe...it's that lingering stench of smokey nightclubs, must stamp it out!   I was hoping to put up some Paris/Barcelona pics, but my computer has officially 100% died (I think), so will probably have to get it fixed before I can do anything with it. I'm currently trying to check my webmail at 28.8 bps.....patience, patience. :-)  I might do a load of laundry in between reading each message. I have about 45 digital pics coming...and about 8 rolls of regular film to develop. I went nuts.  Oh, and as soon as I get access to a scanner, I have some cute family pics to put up. I have a nice one of me, Kelsey, Jessie, and Sean Thomas, and this hilarious pic of me and my Polish grandmother, Babci (the one that I take after physically and through my lipstick fetish!). I made her stand with her hand on her hip like me, and we look like little bookends.  I have lots to write about in regards to my brief European adventures, but my eyes are closing as I type this...  HUGE thanks to Rachel and Anthony for their wonderful hospitality and generosity and yummy home cooked meals in Paris!   Hugs to Javier, David, and Douglas in Barcelona - I am so jealous you are still there!  Kristen, can you email me your phone number to my  urlLink butterflynet@ekno.com  account? My noggin one takes a thousand years to load up!  As Kristen would say, SMOOCHES, everyone!  Family, I'll be seeing you all (I hope) this weekend!   p.s. Big shout-out to  Javaboy  for a) Doing that Melbourne Thang (I adore Melbourne, so the Melbourne thang really is a cool thing to do!) and b)  for giving everyone the lowdown on my overseas travels...hehe :-)

        Adios, Barcelona!   Desgraciadamente, anoche es mi ltima noche in Barcelona. Unfortunately, tonight is my last night in Barcelona. Im very disappointed to leave here. Had a blast on my last day including swimming and sunning myself (under many many applications of SPF 30 suncreen, mind you) at this incredible beach town called Sitge, which is 30 minutes out of Barcelona. Then I went back into the city to catch a bus to Montjuic and had a super cable car ride, giving me a lovely panoramic view of Barcelona from the sky. Ive seen Barcelona from nearly every angle now....from the highest point in Barcelona, Tibidabo, to the other side of the city @ Montjuic. I caught some amazing cacti gardens and was down at the Port once again, but from the other side. Im off to the hostel now, to shower as Im awfully disgusting....dinner, maybe some dancing....and then Im off on a train to Paris tomorrow morning. I leave for London on Tuesday morning, and arrive in New York Tuesday arvo and in Springfield Tuesday night.....its been an amazing time. Cant wait to write about it all properly when I get back!

        Me Encanta Barcelona  I heart Barcelona.  I am definitely coming back here one day. Lets see....on Wednesday I toured all around Barcelona and ended up meeting these lovely Irish boys. I went out with them that night and had a great time...I was in fine form on the dance floor @ this club and by the time I started the dancing going by strutting out to the middle of the dance floor myself and getting my groove on, Id nearly forgotten the humiliating incident Id had earlier at the pub when I ended up having to use the mens room and this guy accidentally walked in on my stall only to catch with me with pants and undies down around my knees. Ooops! I dont know who was more embarassed. The Irish guys had a good laugh when I told them what happened though.  Thursday I toured more all around Barcelona. Ive seen some amazing things, which I will write about fully when I get back to the States --not enough time now as we will be going to have dinner soon. Javier and David arrived on Thursday night and weve been staying out dancing till 4-5am. Apparently I am just as popular with gay men in Barcelona as I am in Sydney. Weve gone to a lot of clubs and all the gay men have come up to me to compliment my dancing and to dance with me and give me kisses on the cheek. Ive been kissed by some guy every day that Ive been here so far....hahahahha!  Oh, and I must remember to write about this random freak who tried to ask me out on the sidewalk - quite the crazy character. He was original, to say the least!  Having a blast here even though I ended up spending 4 hours at the train station one day trying to get my return ticket to Paris. All the trains have been full so I have to catch a different train back to Paris. It doesnt affect my train to London or flight to New York, but I wont have time to do sight-seeing in Paris on Monday as I arrive at 5.30pm instead of 8am. ;(  Rachel, if youre reading this, I arrive on Monday at 5.30pm from Gare Lyon, but I will ring you guys tomorrow.  Mum, thanks for those airport directions for NYC!  Kristen, love the blog! You are hilarious! Cannot wait to see you! I get back to the States on Tuesday night, so Ill be talking to you soon!  See all you Springfieldiens-Bostonians soon!

        Tuesday 23rd of July 2002    Blogger No Like Me!   My blog is sick. Poor bloggy. I've been trying to post something to this blog for about 4 days, to no avail. I can't add a new posting, but I can edit this one...weird...in the meantime, I'll be posting somewhere else...probably...details later! I'm in Rhode Island now, with my parents, Aunt, Uncle, and cousins. Hey Sheas! Hey McGuires!  --------   Boston or Bust   Well, it's time...time to make my pilgrimage to Boston aka Bean Town. I'm not particularly jumping for joy to get on the 2-hour Peter Pan bus fiasco which will inevitably require me to sit next to some smelly guy who talks to himself, but hey, thems the breaks. It's a small price to pay in order to visit my friends in Boston in the summer - yay! I head off tomorrow morning (Thurday, US-time) and come back Saturday arvo. I will definitely be seeing Shayna, Brian, Kelly, Steve, and the infamous Kristikeet! There are a couple other friends I might see, but time is tight, so we'll see what happens. That's probably the hardest thing when you live so far away - trying to pack all the friends and fam in when you come home to visit. :(  *Reminiscing about the time I was on the bus from Springfield to Boston,  sitting across from the smelliest guy in the world (and that's a pretty serious thing to say, as I know a lot of smelly guys) and I had this banana that was fairly ripe. I had it in a plastic bag and I kept inhaling the smell of ripe banana to keep me from passing out....I've learned lots of survival tactics in my old age! *  My stories from yesterday, and from Paris & Barcelona will have to wait....grrrr! Tonight I'm packing for Boston, Rhode Island, and Sydney. Crazy!  Hasta la vista!

        "We Are Family....I Got All My Relatives and Me"   Okay, so it really doesn't flow well...'relatives' is a little too long, but I don't have sisters, so what's an only child to do. Just a quick lowdown to say thanks to all the relatives I saw today. I had an excellent time with my grandmother, Babci, and my Uncle Frank during the day, and then a very very fun night with my Auntie Kate and Auntie Jo. Thanks heaps, you guys! I'll elaborate more tomorrow, I'm bushed!  Night!

        Captain Caterpillar Saves the Day   Previously, I only knew one Captain. Good ol' Captain Starlight. But today, I met another Captain. Captain Caterpillar. Yes, I am serious.  I went with my parents and my grandmother to Deerfield Massachusetts'    urlLink MagicWings   Butterfly Conservatory & Gardens. It's only about a 45 minute drive from Springfield. So, off we went to what seemed like it would be a nice, relaxing day. But of course, could anything really be nice and relaxing with my family?  We got there, and of course we had to eat first, as anything food/eating related takes priority over, well, anything in my family. Not that I was complaining, I was hungry too. Then we headed straight for the conservatory. Now, I warned everyone that butterflies would be flying freely all over the place...i.e. potentially all over us. My mother listened. My grandmother listened, but was a bit freaked out when all the butterflies kept flittering past her face and landing on her. Daddy Dearest did  not  listen. My dad had a big butterfly on his calf and made a move to smack it. "DAD!" I yelled. "Oh, right," he said. Yeah, they tend to look down upon smacking, hitting, touching, scaring, killing the butterflies. Go figure. :-) It is a conservatory after all.   What followed was a very immature argument with my father over who would take photos of the butterflies. It's nice to know that some things just never change. Give my dad and I two minutes. We  will  find something to argue about, guaranteed. My dad chided me for not bringing my own camera to take pictures with. I pointed out that my camera had no film, and more importantly, the lens was dirty, so what was the point of taking photos that would be destined to be covered in spots due to crap on my lens? My dad gave me, "Well, that's too bad for you, isn't it!" and I gave him, The Look. This particular withering glance was supposed to convey, "Um, hi, remember me? I am the butterfly freak here, not you, this is  my  thing,  I  wanted to come here, so can I please please please take photos?"  Plus, my father has a tendancy to take unintended photos of the tops of trees, the ground, the sky, basically anything but the intended object. In the photographic world of hit or miss, he can be mostly miss. Which is not to say he hasn't taken some lovely photos in his day, but if you count the number of "ooops, the subject of this photograph seems to be missing" compared to actual "thumbs up" shots, the ratio speaks for itself.   My dad ignored my Look and proceeded to walk around the place taking photos that may turn out as leaves, with butterflies mysteriously missing. My mother and I exchanged looks of, "Is he really going to be a pain and not let Lori take the photos?"  Eventually, my father gave me back the camera, with the threat that he would be taking it back before too long. And he began to walk 2 inches behind me, practically on top of me. "Why don't you walk ahead of me?" I suggested. Alas, no. I somehow managed to sneak away. When he found me again, he called out my name and I gave him an exasperated "What???" and my father told me, three times, to "watch my tone."  I smiled at the lucky strangers who happened to witness this event. They had no idea I was actually 25, and not 15. Sigh.  Once I was finally "free" I had a grand ol' time. I love these things. I love just walking around and watching them zoom and fly and flitter and dangle and hover and flap and twirl and chase each other and feed and dance, and all that fun stuff. So many beautiful colours, sizes, shapes, designs. I do enjoy the challenge of taking photos of butterflies, but it's a lot more fun to put the damn camera down and just sit quietly and watch. (I ended up getting a disposable camera as my parents' camera was pissing me off. It only took a photo about 1 out of every 12 times I pressed the button....ooops!)  Very soon after I started walking around, I was approached by Captain Caterpillar. And for the next two hours, he appeared by my side about every ten minutes to give me a new little factoid or bit of butterfly trivia. I "wowed" him with my knowledge of the Ulysses Blue, my favourite butterfly from Kuranda, Queensland, in Australia. Captain Caterpillar reminded me a bit of Mr. Rogers, only without the sweater, and he looked at me and said, "Wow. I think if I ever went to Australia, I wouldn't want to come back."  :-) When my mother and grandmother came over and saw Captain C talking my ear off, they just gave me that, "Strangers sure do love you!" look.   Anyhoo, Captain C was very nice. He insisted on trying to get me a photo of the gorgeous blue butterflies, and I think I actually got one or two good ones. He helpfully pointed out a couple of spots where I could snag a good shot. So, I'd just wander around, looking everywhere, in awe, just staring, and Captain Caterpillar would pass by, every 5-10 minutes, distributing a fun fact. This went on for quite a while. I walked by a bench and saw the blue butterfly I'd photographed laying on the ground. I thought it was dead. : ( I alerted one of the "flight attendants" and she came and picked it up and gave it some food. It was still alive, but not looking too good. Then I found a gorgeous green butterfly that looked like it had lost one of its wings. My pal Captain Caterpillar was coming over for my next factoid and I pointed out the injured fella to him. (And to think I was never a Girl Scout!) As it turned out, the other wing was just wet and plastered to the ground, but it was still attached to the butterfly. Yay. So Captain C picked him up and placed him down on the bench next to me, to let his wings dry. I sat guard, making sure no dumbass came and sat their dumb ass down on the hurt butterfly.   I spent a good half hour just taking in the view, watching and observing the other butterflies, and protecting the green one from unobservant bums. Captain Caterpillar came over and asked me what I was thinking about, he said I looked too serious. I told him not to worry. Apparently he saw my mother about 10 minutes later and went up to her and said he was concerned that I was too serious a person - he told her I should be smiling and enjoying the other butterflies instead of taking care of the injured ones. My mother was like, "Who are you talking about?" and he said, "Your daughter."  Hahahahahaha - Captain C is just as smart as a whip. So all was well until my mother found me and told me my father was close to having a conniption fit. He wanted to leave. Apparently the butterflies freaked him out and he wanted to go home. Pronto. My father is not a patient man, and I could feel that vein throbbing in his temple the total of 5 minutes I spent in the butterfly gift shop. Let me tell you, 5 minutes is a miracle for me. When I went to the Butterfly Sanctuary in Kuranda, QLD, they actually waived the $10 entry fee and let me in for free. I'm guessing this is because they took one look at me and realised they were going to make a hell of a lot of money out of me in the gift shop. I arrived wearing a butterfly shirt, butterfly earrings, butterfly necklace, butterfly rings, etc. (standard fare for me!)  They could reconignise a sucker when they saw one....and I did buy out their giftshop, they were right.   On the way home we passed a farm and got some sweet corn, tomatoes, string beans, squash, blueberries and raspberries. Yum....nothing like farm fresh fruits and veggies. We also stopped to drop off two more rolls of film and to pick up my remaining 3 rolls. Guess what? They've lost one of my rolls of film from Europe. Nice one! They're now putting a 'trace' on it. Here's hoping it works! :-)

        All in the Family   Thanks to the Sheas, McGuires, Colsons, and Cullens for coming out for a little pizza/pool/Hey Lori get-together! The Colsons (Auntie Jo, Uncle Rusty, Jessie and A.J.) were nice enough to offer their lovely home as the venue. The pool looked straight out of a holiday brochure thanks to my Uncle,  and my Aunt should really be submitting her photos to National Geographic or something. The photos she took in Ireland, which she blew up and framed above the couch in the living room are spectacular. My cousin Jessie took me up to show me her bedroom - it's all decked out in....butterflies. Good to see my influence happening. Her room looks awesome, I was very impressed. Also must give major kudos to the Colsons for their first floor bathroom. It's the "Golf Bathroom."  In every possible way. They have a golf motif like you've never seen before. From a floor mat specially designed by my Aunt to look like a golf course (complete with sandtraps) to photos of famous golfers (and themselves) golfing, framed on the wall, to cabinet handles in the shape of golf balls, golf ball soap, and towel racks made out of actual golf clubs....it's cool yet scary at the same time. I think I mentioned that my parents did our bathroom in full-on butterflies. I was explaining the whole bathroom thing to a friend who just looked at me and was like, "GEEZ! What is with you people? How much time does your family actually spend in the bathroom?" And I started laughing....I said, "Oh, you'd be surprised..." My family is well-known for their weak stomachs....we should be the poster family for an Immodium AD commercial. Just remember, I am pretty much  the only weird one who eats spicy food. I usually have an iron stomach...well, except when I get a flu bug, but otherwise, I can eat just about anything.  So, we all sat around and chatted, swam, passed around pictures. I've got a great cute pic of my cousin A.J. - it's his baseball card. And I want a T-shirt saying, "I Survived All 26 Rolls of the McGuires' Trip to Disneyworld."  I am not kidding. Well, now I see where I get my compulsive photo taking gene from. I was talking to my Auntie Kate and I said, "I think I went crazy - I took 8 rolls of photos in Paris/Barcelona, 4 of which are 36 exposures." And my Aunt said, "I got you beat. I took 26 rolls of Disneyworld." And we were both on holiday for 2 weeks. Well, needless to say, I felt much better about my 8 rolls after I heard that, so thanks Auntie Kate! There were a lot of good pics and there, and Auntie Kate, if you want to blow up one of Tarzan for me, I won't complain!   Rob & Jamie, I'd like to hang out again before I head back! And when I say hang out, don't worry, I mean separately! :-)   Oh, and kudos also to my cousin Kelsey, who is also doing me proud by collecting cool butterfly stuff. I feel like I've started a cult or something...

        I Might Be a Loser   It is a Friday night. It is 8.30pm. And I am stupidly sitting here doing work...at work! Unfortunately my home computer is screwed so I'm trying to update the  urlLink National Campus Band Comp  calendar and press releases tonight so I don't have to worry about it on Monday...sigh...  Huge thanks to Damian for a very fun night last night - I've walked by the Hollywood Hotel hundreds of times, but have never been inside, never knew the power of the mirror ball in the pub! I had my first Toohey's Old in over 6 weeks!  And ohmygod, anyone who loves Indian food (especially as much as my Auntie Kate!) has to get themselves to Maya's on Cleveland Street. It's this amazing vegetarian Indian Restaurant. Everything was so good! To be honest, I am not even sure what the hell we ate - I let Damian order since he was the expert. I requested lots of lentils, and that's about all I can be sure we had. It was  all  yummy and it was quite entertaining to share mutual 'travel' stories.   Tonight I am going to be a loser and do some work and then go home to bed where I hope I will actually remain past 3am! Tomorrow night will be the house-warming at Chad's which I am very much looking forward to - and will hopefully see  these   urlLink cool   urlLink guys ! (*Ahem, three different links in there, I'm lazy and smooshed them all together*)  Things I've noticed since I've been back in Sydney:  My 'cold' tolerance is even more pathetic than I thought. I'm cold even when it's really not cold.  I really missed the Aussie accent!  For some reason, I keep saying, 'Up the wazzoo' - not sure how I came to suddenly adopt a phrase I don't recall using very often before...  I've also been using, 'How you like  them  apples?'  Mid 20's-life crisis? I confused poor Ray when I used that phrase in an e-mail this week. It was hard to explain that it didn't actually  mean  anything about apples. Does anyone know where that phrase came from anyway? Why apples? I always liked this phrase, despite the whole apple ignorance. And I liked it before  Good Will Hunting  too.  I'll give you 200x what I make in overtime if you can explain this phrase to me....(*note, I make zip in overtime). In any case, in my e-mail to Ray I jokingly said that I would not come to the birthday bash this week unless I was allowed to jump out of the birthday cake....so, how you like  them  apples? Ray thought apples were an inuendo for, well, you know.... ;-)  I'm suffering from gig withdrawl. I have not been to a gig in over 6 weeks. That is like 6 years to me.  I hate unpacking almost as much as I hate packing. I have really not unpacked at all since I've been back. Every day I wake up and open my suitcase and pick out a clean outfit to wear. Should I legally change my name from Lori to Lazy?   Time is ticking away on my new year's resolution to sing somewhere in Sydney in public before the end of the year. Karaoke doesn't count. It'll have to either be some painful open mic experience, or busking at Central Station, in which case people would probably pay me money to shut up.   Okay, back to work for me - hello to the family in Springfield and the friends in Boston - I do miss you guys!  p.s. Happy 29th birthday to Ray - you're still young, baby! p.p.s. HUGE congratulations to Jo & Steve - on finally setting a wedding date! Woo-hoo!

        Fish Outta Water   Hmmm, so it's taking me a bit longer to re-adjust to Sydney than I expected. I am probably nuts as this is only my 3rd day back in town, but usually I'm pretty much re-adjusted to wherever I am within 24 hours. Am I slowing down in my old age? Work is crazy, though it's nice to see that the boys have finally learned how to answer the telephone in my absence. (Hi boys!) I had two sandwich shop owners yell at me for not telling them I was going away. What was I supposed to say? "Toasted Ham and Cheese, please - by the way I'm going overseas for 5 weeks, can I have salt and pepper on that?" :-) I walked in to one shop this morning and 4 workers were like, "Lori! Welcome back, Miss America! Miss Springfield, you're back!" Hahahaha. Too funny. And the work clients seem awfully relieved...."OHMYGOD, you're back! Thank GOD! Do you know how much we've missed you?" Poor gits.  So, the re-adjustment is slow. I was only gone for 5 weeks. Feels like 5 years. I wake up not knowing where the hell I am. Oh, and I cannot sleep past 3am!!!! WTF! Is this reverse jet-lag? I go to bed between 9 and 10 and by 3am, am wide-awake, not to get sleepy again until my alarm is about to go off. I haven't really hung out with or called any friends yet except for the mini-gang on Monday - haven't really been in a social mood, but I'm hoping to be my perky little self again in a few days.   Looking forward to the party at Fan-Man's this saturday! Woo-hoo!  Okay, going home, to bed, I hope. What an exciting life I lead! :-)

        I'M BAAAAAAAA-AAAAACK!   So, I'm back in Sydney. Ooops, my blog has finally been 'fixed' - now all the posts I was trying to make are showing up. OOps! I'll have to go back and delete all that crap. I actually started a new blog temporarily as I was so frustrated I couldn't post to this one. Not that anyone saw it!

        urlLink    Pick-Up Lines, Tactics, Strategies   I could write a book on the pick-up lines and strategies that I've heard in my day that will never and should never work, at least if there is anything truly good and just in this world. Lately, I've heard an earful and an eyeful and I am amazed by the material that has helped these people get where they are today. They're not 18, so you would think they are using things they've had success with in the past. *Shuddering* Who the hell are these women that let these guys get away with this! They need to be smacked! I need K to help me 'put the smack-down' on them, but she's going to be a little too busy moving. (You go, girl!) I really want to post some examples here in my blog, but I'm afraid someone might see them and use them. And I would feel horrible about that...but maybe I'll change my mind and put them up tomorrow. To give you an idea, I typed some up and passed them on to my co-workers, who printed them out to take home to their girlfriends so they could all have a good laugh.  Yes, they're  that  bad.   urlLink   Well, as usual, lots going on and I can't get into any details, but as soon as I know anything, all those who need to know, well, I'll let you know!  Thanks to my Baby J, I've finally got 2 pics from...*sigh* Barcelona....the first is of Javier and I in front of La Sagrada Familia and the second is of David and I in front of, yes, you guessed it, La Sagrada Familia. What an amazing building. It's a church, a work of art, a place of worship (even if you don't worship at the alter of any deities, you'll want to bow down in  big 'I'm not worthy'  fashion when you see this place in person!).   Last night we celebrated Ray, Jorge, and Heather's birthday - happy b-day, guys! We went to Wagamama's....it was the easiest one to find yet. We hunted for the one in London for hours and by the time we found it, we had to leave. We hunted for the one in  Dublin for hours and finally got in. Sydney's is the most reasonably locateable! Food was yummy, juices yummy, cake was yummy. And now I'm starving, so I'm off...  p.s. Thanks to Skot for being the first to tip me off....I can't wait to hear what my old teacher for Chaos Theory (a quantum physicist) thinks about this...looks like  urlLink The Speed of Light  may not be so constant after all. Who knows? It will be pretty funny if it's not constant - no offense to Einstein of course. I used to be a biology major, and I had to take my fair share of chemistry, calculus, physics and the like and that's what kills me about the 'pure' sciences - that most people take everything way too seriously. As my tough but wise Statistics professor used to say, "Science isn't the truth, it's just the best answers we have today." Amen, sister. Lots of things we know right now might be proved false in just a few years time, so we can't get too cocky...hehe e=mc squared, baby!

        urlLink    What's My Name Again?   Okay, so I need some help form all you creative people out there...starting from tomorrow, I'm going to be ringing around various Australian companies, trying to score some new business. I've decided that "Lori" will just not do. People get confused by it. They think I'm saying "Marie" or "Mary" or that it's short for Lorraine. Thank god, my name is not short for Lorraine! No offense, but I can't stand that name. Anyway, so far, I've gotten suggestions such as: Felicity, Miranda Marks, Lexa Jones, Samantha etc. Looking for strong & confident sounding female names that people will understand straight away. Any  urlLink suggestions ?   urlLink    The Good Weekend   This weekend I did a fair bit of writing, walked around Vic Park, downtown, had my longlost bean nachos from the Turkish boys @ Broadway, my cafe mocha with a shot of raspberry syrup at Gloria Jeans, trying to hit my old favourites. Thanks to Chad for the party invite - I had a lovely time on Saturday night! Met some very cool people, had some great chats with some very cool people, and I met some very very interesting characters, one in particular who was just out of control. He was absolutely hilarious, but that boy needs to be put on a leash for the safety of women everywhere. ;-) Now, as for a gentleman, check out my handsome grandfather over there - I don't think he would have said such things to a gal when he was a young spunk! (And even if he did, he would never admit to it and I don't want to know about it!)   urlLink   My computer has still not been fixed and I am trying to build up the energy to scan my 1000 photos from Europe and Springfield/Boston/Rhode Island, but I got these pics of a disk I got when developing the photos. Here are a couple pics that will soonish make their way over to the Butterfly gallery, as well as a pic of one of my favourite butterfly lovers, my beautiful cousin Kelsey. The butterfly pics are two of the ones I took at the  urlLink Magic Wings  Butterfly Conservatory & Gardens in Deerfield Massachusetts.    urlLink   I am majorly bummed that I just missed  Austin Powers III  in the States...it came out the day before I was heading back to Oz...on July 26th, and it doesn't come out here until something like September 29th...*pout*.  I am very grateful to United Airlines for the mileage points I just racked up, but kiddies, you gotta do something about your movie selection. Mix 'em up a little! Please! Even old movie would be better than the same old stuff. I have seen  I am Sam ,  Monsters Inc.  and  Big Fat Liar  three times each...on my flights in the last 5 weeks. I fell asleep during  The Shipping News  every time and woke up in the same place every time, so I've no idea what happened.  urlLink    I successfully avoided  Time Machine  from Sydney to San Fran, New York to London, London to New York, New York to L.A., and L.A. to Sydney. I also saw this movie with this elderly woman who befriends a young boy who lost his mom but I cannot remember the name of it...it has Ray Liotta in it, and I watched the movie several times even though Ray Liotta has always freaked me out since  Unlawful Entry .  And yes, I probably said it before, but I'll say it again...yes, I did cry during the same parts of  I am Sam  every damn time. I am the pathetic movie-goer...all through my flights I kept sitting next to older women who refused to watch movies that were sad or scary. Now, I understand that most people want to be uplifted, amused, and entertained by watching movies and obviously comedies will often put you in a good mood, but you're going to miss out on a ton of good stuff if you refuse to watch anything that's not a comedy! All the movies I recommended to this one lady next to me was met with a: "No. That movie's sad. I don't want to see it." I would insist, "But it's really good! Sad, but  good ...hey, it's got a happy ending, okay???" That got a smile, but she still didn't go for it. What can you do? ;-)

        Leopard Print Faux-Pas   Craziness, as usual, no time to write about it, as usual. There's a new gal in the office - yay! She doesn't work for our company, but she's renting office space from us. It's so nice to have some estrogen in the office - someone to  sympathise with me about all the testosterone in the office! I've been the only chick here for a long time. We had our first bonding session today when Abby invited me to go shopping with her at this fashion warehouse with major discounts on last season's stuff. So we took at quick look this arvo. Oh the joys of the one-room changing room. I realised, in horror, that I was wearing my most embarassing underwear. It's this new leopard-print cotton underwear...I stupidly bought the hi-cut instead of my usual bikini briefs and I'm regretting it - they look like I'm wearing leopard print underwear for old ladies. They're huge! So, when trying on some skirts I kept giving sneaky furtive glances to the naked women around me, making sure no one was looking at my stupid underwear. Most of them were trying on bathing suits and didn't give a damn, thank goodness. I tried to hide my underwear with one skirt while trying the other skirt on. Not a good look. Funnily enough, Abby and I ended up buying the same skirt.  The boys in the office will get a good laugh if we end up wearing it at the same time...  On to bigger news...tomorrow I am going to my first BBQ in Australia. Some of you might be thinking, so what? But to any Aussies reading this, you will understand the importance. I have been here for over 2.5 years and have never had a proper Aussie BBQ. It's shameful. I've had Aussie friends put their hands on my shoulder and say, "Ohmygod, I am so sorry, we will rectify this."  But it just never happened. Invites happened, stuff came up, things fell through. I was starting to think I was cursed in BBQs.  But tomorrow will change all that...my first proper BBQ, in Asquith ( or ask with my ass, right Kristen?) and I'm bringing the salad because I'm "the girl." Boys hunt, me collect fruits and vegetables....whatever ;)  Quick note about our favourite almost-Seattleite, Kristen! I spoke to the lovely gal for nearly 2 hours last night. She says to send her love to you all, you all know who you are. I am very excited for her about her trip - she's leaving Monday, U.S. time, Smooches! :-)  Sunday I shall be mosey-ing on down to Science Day @ the Australian Museum and the Botanic Gardens etc. to see cool sciency stuff and make fun of Chad hosting the kiddie Solar Boat Race (I'm just jealous, Chad). Looking forward to  catching up with 2 of my new favourite gals, C + M. :)  Tonight I'll likely be heading to the movies...  Oh, and the good news is that I'll probably have some news next week. Yes,  that  news. That should mean something to my family and friends. Hint, hint.   Good luck to Rammstein and Co in Spain - I hope the grunting works. :-)  Later taters!

        Me and My Big Mouth   I obviously jinxed the warm beautiful weather. :( It's been chilly - around 55 degrees F for all you little yankees, which is nothing for winter, but pains me and my pathetic body.   I was eating dinner while watching  24  last night and I was gripping my sandwich so tightly, I practically squeezed it to death, I was so tense, especially for those poor kidnapped gals. Yes, I'm getting way too into the show, but so what? ;) I was hooked on last week's show (thanks again, Shayna!) and I know exactly what was going to happen, but I was still sucked in.   Speaking of getting sucked in, I had no intention of watching  Ally McBeal  this season but those cruel bastards have cast James Marsden in the show and I now I have to watch the entire season just to perv at James. I don't normally go for uber-pretty boys, but I just can't help myself with him. Could his lips/eyes  be  any sexier?  Lots of stuff going on...in the ever elusive visa saga, I have to go get a full medical exam done first thing tomorrow morning. Blood-tests, urine tests, X-Rays, TB tests, the whole works. I love it when you have to do something that requires you to not pee before leaving the house in the morning. If there was something wrong with me, would they even tell me? I had to have this done two years ago and they don't tell you anything, it just goes straight to immigration. When you pay a couple of hundred bucks, you'd like to at least know your height and weight! Sigh...I wonder if I'll get the same nurse as last time. She saw my butterfly fetish (Based on my bfly shirt, rings, necklace) and took blood with a butterfly syringe. I was like, "Thanks, but I still don't want to watch you take my blood!"  Oh, one final thing before I head off to dinner with J and L, I just started reading,  Down Under  by Bill Bryson thanks to a loud recommendation from Rachel. (Thanks, Rach!) Last night I thought I was going to bust a lung or a rib, or pee my pants. I haven't laughed that hard at a book, a movie, or anything in so long....and I'm only into the second chapter. I was dying....I was laying in bed, crying, gasping for breath. You know when you get into those laughing fits and can't stop? That was me. He's such a hilarious writer, and I can relate to a lot of what he writes about. I can't wait to read more tonight. It will be a reward after I spend 2 hours filling out the official paperwork for my visa health exam! :-)

        Global Warming   I know global warming is bad, verrry bad, but damn it was nice this weekend! Summer weather in winter. I was very happy! Saturday night was the dual Ray and Jorge birthdays - we thought of you too, Heather! We had dinner at a yummy Greek place and then we went out dancing. I was toning down the dancing so as not to embarass my friends, but the moment I walked into this one club, this old guy came up to me, yelled "Woo-hoo!" and grabbed me around the waist, kissing me on both cheeks. What is wrong with people???  Sunday I saw the premiere of  Stuart Little 2  at Fox Studios, with the lovely Claudine and her adorable daughter Mia. Mia is 2 and was a bit frightened of the Stuart Little in costume dude, but seemed to really like Stuart on the big screen! Then, I spent the afternoon at Bondi with Rocky, Paulo, Marvin, and Mia. We went to the beach in winter. I could not stop thinking this. It was a gorgeous day and I wished I had my bathing suit.  Got some writing done this weekend, and some pesky chores that needed doing...my belated b-day present for Ruth was the envy of everyone on Saturday night - a book called,  I Don't Need to Have Children, I Date Them -  19 Methods of Child Psychology You Can Use on Men . I know Ruth will find it useful. ;-)  Gotta jet - later kiddies!  p.s. Am currently obsessed with Counting Crows' new CD,  Hard Candy  - at the moment I especially love "Hard Candy" and "American Girls" -- and I swear I like "American Girls" because it's damn catchy, and not because of the title ;-)

        urlLink    Surprise, Surprise   A blog on a Saturday! Fancy that! No, my computer isn't fixed, I'm at an internet cafe in Broadway. I came in to update Kristen's blog for her and I figured I might as well say hey in mine too. I don't have time to write now, as I just found out the comedy show Mowzez and I are going to see tonight is a half hour earlier than I thought. Ooops! So I have to run, but I must say that last night was absolutely amazing. Damian, Brad, Lisa, Sarah and I went to go see  iOTA  @ the Hopetoun in Surry Hills. Oh. My. God. I felt a bit nervous as Damian, Brad, Lisa, and Sarah had really never heard of iOTA before and I was hoping they wouldn't hate me for paying $15 to see someone who wasn't their style. Luckily everyone loved the band. They were mind-boggling. They're playing again tonight at the Hoey and I'm so tempted to go again, and blow off everything else. Alas, I don't think I'll do that. :(  I'm going to review the gig for Yap, but let's just say that it was just like an Herbal Essences commercial! Anyone who has the chance to see iOTA play live, don't miss it. I love the albums, but the live performances just out-do everything.

        urlLink     Non-Smoking Sign  Just a quickie...going to see iOTA tonight at the Hopetoun, if it's not sold out. By special artist's request, the Hopetoun will be a non-smoking venue tonight. I'm so excited about this! I'd almost pay the cover just to experience one night of non-smoking goodness! Woo-hoo! Tomorrow morning I'm having brekkie with my old co-worker, Dion, his better half, and their new baby daughter. I'm very excited to meet the baby, though I don't sleep as well through the night as she does, so I hope I will be cheerful company. :)  Tomorrow night will possibly be a comedy night at the Enmore with Mowzez, followed by farewell drinks for Jorge, possibly followed by a birthday bash in Edgecliff. No idea if I will get to all three - we'll see.   Sunday I hope to do absolutely nothing (i.e. read, write, and lounge around in bed all day.)  Oh, I almost forgot to mention the coolest thing I've seen in ages...last night I caught up with Burgie @ the Excelsior. He told me funny tales about life in Korea and brought me cute packs of kleenex with little cartoon characters on them. As we were walking home to our neighbourhoods, we passed the mysterious project that has been going on in my neighbourhood for ages. That big 'dead end' or 'no through road' area next to the Broadway Hotel and the Barnibas (sp?) Church.  They've been doing  something  there for ages and I just finally caught a glimpse last night. It says on the sidewalk, in beautiful lettering, Broadway: The Publican and the Priest. Andrew told me that apparently the Church used to put signs out front (they still do) with phrases like, "Better to be happy than rich" and the Broadway Hotel would put up a counter-sign saying something like, "Better to be happy and rich than happy and poor," etc. etc. I'm probably messing them up, but you get the point. Anyway, the sidewalk is full of Publican vs. Priest examples. It's quite beautiful, and cool and funny. I hope the taggers leave it alone, but that's wishful thinking! Anyway, great project, Sydney!  p.s. The pic is from the view of Tibidabo, the highest point in Barcelona. Someone had the brilliant idea of building a church and an amusement park on top of a mountain! I love it! :-)

           Wanna Get a Beer, Darl?   So, it's late, I'm walking home last night via Central Station and a very intoxicated man staggers alongside me. "Well, good evening, my lovely." I look at him briefly to make sure he hasn't got his hand out to grab my ass and I say, "Hey."  I begin to walk faster. "So," he says, staggering more quickly to catch up, "Whatchya got in that bag? Lead?" He laughs at his own wit. "Yes," I answer seriously. "I am carrying lead in my bag. It's all the rage. All the kids are doing it these days." He stares at me and thinks about this. To avoid further confusion he tries another approach. "So, where are you from?" After mulling over various answers like, "Sri Lanka, Azkaban, and Neptune," I decide to settle for "Boston."  This gets a startling reaction. "Boston, hey? Isn't that where all those pommy bastards, those Queen loving pommy bastards went to?" I nod and say, "Yes, yes it is. And they're all still there. Breeding." He accepts this and says, "So, you wanna come out with me for a beer, darl?" To which I say, brightly, "No thanks!" and jog away leaving him to think about Pommy bastards in Boston and why kids think it's cool to carry lead in their bags...     Random: Film, Music, Phones   Any Aussie Uni students out there? If you're born to direct, but people don't know it yet, head to the  urlLink National Student Film & Video Festival . Hurry, you've only got a couple weeks to go!  And if you're in Oz and a music lover of any kind, be sure to check out band comp heats at a campus near you for the  urlLink National Campus Band Comp . You can check out the  urlLink Band Comp Calendar  for the dates. Go on, support the kiddies!  So, I received a text message on my mobile/cell phone yesterday telling me that SMS chat was now available. Oh goody! SMS chat! That's just what I need. I  hate  sending text messages to my friends because I am the slowest text messager in the world (which is sad for one of the world's fastest typists*), and I usually get so annoyed after passing the letter I wanted three times in a row that I end up just calling the person,  so imagine the joy of knowing that I could be going crazy chatting people via painful SMS! If anyone is a satisfied Vodafone or Telstra customer out there, please  urlLink let me know . I've just about had it with Optus and the stupid 'Optus Lady' - about 70% of the time I try to call anyone, I get a message saying to please try my call later. Or my new favourite is when I get the message saying, "The mobile which you are calling is either unavailable or switched off..." and I'm only ever dialling 222, which is the number I use to check my voicemail. Doh! Plus, I just got my Optus long-distance phone bill. I cannot believe that it is correct - I am never home - how could I have possibly made so many calls from my home number? It's the biggest bill I've ever had and I was gone for 5 weeks in there - something's fishy. I may have to ask for a more detailed bill as the local calls add up to more than the long distance ones.   * Okay, so I'm not the world's fastest typist, but I'm the fastest typist I know. **The pic is of  La Sagrada Familia , Barcelona.

        urlLink   Sweet Dreams...Are Made of These   | The  Barcelona 2002  Blog  I would like to live in this picture. It is of Park Guell (Barcelona), which was designed of course by my future husband in my next life, Antoni Gaudi. I was very inspired while in this park - I'll describe it later, but it is just gorgeous. I keep hoping I'll dream about it soon. Speaking of dreams...I had a rather, er, 'intimate' dream the other night. No, it was not quite  that  kind of dream, but it was bordering on it. Anyway, the weird thing was that the dream was about a friend of mine and I've seen him since the dream and I think I actually blushed when I saw him, as if he knew I'd had the dream. What's extra annoying is that it couldn't have just been a nice harmless  fun  dream - no, even in my dream my conscience would not let anything happen. What is  wrong  with me? Anyway, it gave me an idea for a story which you might just be seeing here soon.   Made a few minor updates to  urlLink Smalljustice.com . I have heaps more to go and I can't wait to get the re-design happening!  The infamous Andrew B is back in town after spending 8 months in Korea. I am probably going to meet up with him tomorrow night so he can tell me wondrous tales of historical myths and facts and philosphical conundrums and how Koreans love Australians because they're both Anti-American. ;-)   iOTA is playing at the Hopetoun four nights this week and I have to see them one of those nights, hmmmmm...Gavin just rang to give me a hard time about us not having scheduled one band practice since I've been back - maybe we'll be inspired by iOTA.   I don't have the energy to type up the rest of the things I was planning on, so I'll continue to be the procrastination queen and say, Adios!

        urlLink    BBQ, Barcelona, Movies, Dreams, Oh My   Briefly: Had my first Aussie BBQ on Saturday - fantastic. The Prime boys made their own Sausages and they were excellent! I begged them not to tell me what was in them or how they made them though. Thank you, Prime Sausage Factory!  I'm trying to put up some info/links to Barcelona for Jorge, Jamie, Robyn, and Rammstein, and I threw something together that is SO dodgy. I'll try to make it look bearable soon, but in the meantime, it's at:  urlLink http://barcelona2002.blogspot.com .  I saw  The Sweetest Thing  and  Signs  on Friday - more about that later....and I've set a new post-mid-year resolution for myself, more about that later too, and I apologise to C+C for completely bailing on Sunday. I didn't get home from the party until like 2 in the afternoon ooops.   Oh, and hopefully I'll have time soon to write about the dream I had last night - it's given me inspiration for a new fiction story...  Later!  p.s. The pic is of Sitges, a beach 40 mins outside of Barcelona, and where I wish I was right now! :-)

        urlLink    And the Answer Is: Hey, Hey, I Can Stay!   Lori's got her visa. Finally. That's right. They said yes! I am shocked, stunned, amazed, baffled. I thought for sure my working visa application would get stuck to the bottom of a drawer somewhere, but lo and behold, they said yes.   The FAQ:     So, what does this mean?    The working visa is good for up to 2 years maximum, but lasts as long as my working contract.  I'm not getting kicked out yet - MUHAHAHAHA!  Immi.gration obviously read my blog on the celebration of my first real Aussie BBQ and decided to give me a break. (Obviously just regularly eating vegemite toast wasn't enough for them!)  I'm not in limbo anymore. Seriously, I was going to change my address to 666 Limbo Road, Sydney, Post Code 000?  When people ask what I'm here on I can just say, "Oh, I'm on a temporary working visa" and not have to say, "Well, you see, first I applied for X, and then two years later...and now I'm on my 8th visa...and...yadda yadda...(at this point most people have fallen asleep) etc"  My father can stop writing letters to Immi.gration telling them to kick me out  My parents can start planning their next trip to Australia and my Dad can sample the two benches he didn't get a chance to sit on in all of Sydney in 2000.     So, how do you feel?    Relieved.  Tired.  Pleased.  Happy.  Excited.  Surprised.  Mostly relieved. ;-)    How are you going to celebrate?    Well, I'd like to shout all my friends a drink, but I got a visa, I didn't win the lottery. Sorry, guys :-)  I'm going to celebrate Sydney. I've been thinking about this for over a week now, but each week I'm going to do something or see something that I've never done before in Sydney. There are tons of things I haven't done here yet. I'm going to stop being a slacker. Last week I took the ferry to Balmain for the first time. This week I went to a Korean restaurant I've been meaning to try for the last year. These are only little things, but it's a start. I've compiled a list of slightly more exciting things to do, so now it's a matter of ticking things off and adding more items to the list. If you have any suggestions, just  urlLink holler .   Thank you to all my friends, family, and poor strangers who didn't know what they were getting into when they asked me about my visa situation. :-)

        urlLink    The Visa Verdict is In   Well, I've gotten word from Immi.gration. The news is in. Finally. It's only taken almost 2 years. Unfortunately I have to be a total pain in the ass and not reveal what the verdict is, whether I'm happy or sad, whether I'm packing or unpacking. My laywer just emailed me to tell me what's up. Anyhoo, I'm so sorry to not say anything, but I promised my parents that I would tell them the news (good or bad) first. As soon as I've spoken to them, I will spread the word. I just can't believe they've finally made a decision.

        urlLink    Stupid Nightmares   What is a stupid nightmare in B-fly Land? I classify a stupid nightmare as a dream involving something I simply should not be worrying about anymore. I've had terrible reoccuring nightmares about being kidnapped, chased, hunted, followed, stalked, you name it. They're terrifying and they suck, but hey, they happen. What I should not be having nightmares about are forgetting to hand in school assignments! I'm 25! I graduated from high school SEVEN years ago! I have some Uni nightmares, where I forget to go to some class class, all semester, and find out that I'm not graduating - yeah right, but that was over THREE years ago.  The highschool/junior highschool ones especially drive me insane. Granted, many of my teachers were a piece of work, but still. Why am I having bad dreams about forgetting to hand in homework assignments from the 8th grade? That's just a waste of a nightmare. I'm not saying I prefer dreams where someone is chasing me with the intent to kill me, but if I wake up with my heart-pounding, it better be for something bigger (or better!) than a lost homework assignment!   Recently I've been having nightmares about PHP and HTML. It's dumb, but I'll have be more worried if/when I start dreaming  in  PHP and HTML.     ;-)  Photo from today is another view from Tibidabo, Barcelona and yesterday's pic is of the Cactus Gardens, Barcelona.

        urlLink    Weekend in Review   As usual, I don't have time to get into everything that happened, but, here are some of the highlights/lowlights:    iOTA, must be mentioned again!   Coming across a blocked off street surrounded by policemen, due to a large, dead, bloody body under a sheet, and lots of broken glass indicating someone jumped or was pushed from the window of a tall building overlooking Hyde Park at 2am   Seeing the worst comedy show in years in Enmore with Mowzez. Habib does not deserve Parole! But it was free, woo-hoo!   Having brekkie with my old co-worker, his lovely partner, and their lovely 4 month old daughter on Saturday morning - 'Auntie Lori' brought her a butterfly!  Spending the day writing stories writing at Sydney Harbour/Botanic Gardens   Taking my first ferry ride ever to Balmain (have only been by bus)  Feeling like a secret agent blogging for Kristen.  Running into Graeme, Andrew, Helen, Jacqui, Lisa, and heaps of other people at The Town Hall on Saturday night with Mowzez.  Realising the entire population of Sydney arrived at the Town Hall around 1.30am  Calling my first (and hopefully last) ambulance for a poor homeless guy that was puking up blood on City Road.  Being serenaded by a cabbie singing Eminem lyrics to me.   Having one of your co-workers take your hand and put it on the back of his head and neck, making you feel a strange lump/growth and asking you, "So, what do you think this is?" Ew. I'm like, "Geez, man, I don't know what it is but I sure hope that when that thing hatches, it's not contagious!"    And that's all for today, folks! It's been grand. ;-)

        Real Estate Blunders 303   My real estate agent couldn't just stop with the inspection retardation. Oh no, this little piece of work had to leave me her card on my kitchen table with a "PLEASE CALL ME!!!" scribbled on it violently. What is  wrong  with people? Honestly. She was at my place in the morning. Here's a crazy idea...if she needed to talk to me, why not, I don't know... CALL ME! She had my mobile, work number, etc. Instead the evil woman made me wait all night long wondering what she needed to talk to me about. Was my cleanliness not up to her standards? Did she disapprove of my clutters? Was there some clause in my contract saying that butterflies were not allowed?  So I went to bed thinking about what she could possibly want. Around 2am I woke up having the worst allergic reaction I have had in at least three years - and definitely the worst one I've ever had with no obvious triggers. If I walked into a house full of cats and they all jumped on me, I would understand. If I hang around a pet shop too long, I wouldn't be surprise if I felt ill. If someone with a wool jacket rubs up against me, I'd expect to start itching. (Yes, I know, I'm pathetic, and I should just live in a bubble.) But I was just laying there in bed - my bronchial tubes were spazzing out and I was wheezing and coughing - feeling like soon I wasn't going to be able to breathe. The first thought that entered my brain was: "Maybe the witch is trying to poison me out of my apartment!" Okay, maybe not, but it was really weird!  Anyhoo, I took an antihistimine and about an hour later, I was fine....  to be continued...

        Real Estate Agent Blunders 202   I was sooooo sleepy last night and had to go to bed early. I think I'm sufferring from some sort of protein deficiency or something because I've been craving the strangest things. Do you know what I've ordered for breakfast the last couple days? Toasted sandwiches. But what was in those toasted sandwiches? Melted cheese, fried egg, and...baked beans!!! What the heck is that all about? I have never ever had beans in a sandwich before. But that's what I've been craving and I enjoyed them, dammit!  I forgot to mention this earlier, but HUGE thanks to the lovely Claudine for the most beautiful butterfly bracelet. I actually own absolutely nothing like it - which is amazing, since I am a butterfly freak. Just goes to show there are still new things out there for me! Thanks, C! I love it!  Okay, so back to my dumb-ass Real Estate Agent. I was up at the crack of dawn to vacuum the apartment etc. She was supposed to come over to inspect the place at 8.45am. At 9am, I ring her. She had forgotten about the appointment. She tells me she will be there in 10 minutes. 9.30am. She's not there and I'm officially late for work. I call her again. No answer. Wait 10 more minutes. I call again. No answer. I leave a message saying I'm leaving for work now. I call work to apologise, telling them the lady never showed up but I'm coming in straight away. As I arrive at my office building, I get a call from this flake asking me where I am.   I told her I left a message saying I had to go to work. She told me it was very irresponsible of me to leave like that. I told her it was very irresponsible of her to a) show up over an hour late and b) forget that we had the appointment in the first place. Anyway, I don't actually know what they inspect during an inspection. I hope she doesn't care about any random clutter - I mean, she did just let me know this was happening less than 24 hours beforehand...oh well. Hopefully I won't hear from her for a LONG time!  I should be doing a great deal of work tonight on my extra-curricular projects, but I'm too pooped. Going home to watch  24  and then going to bed - yay!

        Real Estate Agent Blunders 101   Just had a fleeting heart attack - my real estate agent left a message on my mobile asking me to call her back. In the nearly three years I've lived in my apartment, they've never called for something good. I'm not behind on my rent dammit! I was worried they were going to say they were trying to kick me out again. The agent chick called me back several hours later, after I left a message...  Her: "I'm calling to tell you there was a mistake in the letter we sent you."  Me: "What letter? I never received any letter?" (Feeling nauseated, thinking of another pseudo eviction letter.)  Her: "Oh I definitely sent it."  Me: "Well, I definitely didn't receive it."  Her: "Do you receive mail?"  Me: "No, I have no friends. No family. I am a loser orphan who never receives mail."   Me:   "Yes, I receive mail, real actual mail and junk mail, all the time."  Her: "Oh wait, yeah, your letter came back to me."  Me: "So you have my letter - the one I didn't receive."  Her: "Yeah, it came back to me."  Me: "What did you have as the suburb?"  Her: "Broadway."  Me: "I live in Chippendale."  Her: "Oh."  Doh! She's my real estate agent - how can she not know what suburb I live in! Granted, that really shouldn't affect the delivery of my mail. I know there are some angry postal workers out there. They used to cross out Broadway all dramatically in red pen and write over it: CHIPPENDALE in capital letters if people writing to me put the wrong suburb, but they always actually delivered the mail. Are they actually not delivering it now? I find that hard to believe. It's 2007 vs. 2008, everyone knows my street. Gimme a break.  So, either that's what happened with my pseudo eviction letter, or my real estate agents are just idiots. I vote for the latter. I mean during the whole pseudo-eviction thing, this chick actualy said that the eviction letter came back to them in the mail. Now, wouldn't you think, "Hmmm, the resident has not received this eviction notice, as it came back to us, unopened - maybe she has no idea we've evicted her!"  Anyway, the good news is she just wants to come inspect the apartment. But the bad news is that I have to clean the apartment tonight! Oh well, it's a good excuse.   I was attempting to straighten up my bedroom on Sunday, i.e. hang up my clothes, make my bed, organise my books, pack up old immi.gration papers crap, vacuum etc, but I  so  did not want to clean my room that I procrastinated severely. Do you know what I did? I went through photos and ticket stubs from the last 3 years and I wrote letters to my Japanese pen pals who I haven't written to in about 10 years! (No kidding.) On the upside, I did write a letter to my grandmother (Babci) and as the sweetie writes me a letter every week, it's about time I sent her a letter back. What will I do to procrastinate tonight? Sort my CDs by colour? Arrange my lint from biggest to smallest? We'll see.  Last night I went over to Ray's house. He needs a model for his photography class (no, not a nude model, thank you), so I spent a couple hours dolled up in butterfly outfits, playing the guitar and pretending to write deep poetry. I hope I didn't break Ray's camera. Now that Kristen isn't here, poor Ray is modelless. So much for the continuation of my weekend story and Bad Manners...right now I'm off to clean!

        urlLink    'Bad Manners', Music, and Motorcycles   Thursday and Friday I was in denial. That, "No way am I getting sick" denial. Where you're sniffling a bit, your head is hurting, you feel a little too warm and your throat's got that annoying dry thing happening and no matter how much you clear your throat, the cottonball feeling remains. But I wasn't feeling horrible, just weird. Pre-sick. And in denial.  I was determined to go out and hear some music though, so I went straight to Spi Bar after work. I knew if my butt touched my bed or couch for even 30 seconds, I would be in for the night. So I went and George St. was so packed, it took me a half hour to get from Haymarket to Bridge St. I should have walked. Old ladies were passing us. As I was about to get off, I look out the window and spot a young guy in a powersuit and think, "Is that Rocky?" So I ring him and say, "Rocky, are you on George St?" and he says, "Yes, I am! Where are you?" He was going to see Chad @ Spi Bar as well.   Small world! Rocky was there for 30 seconds, and then he had to run. I enjoyed Professor Groove & the Booty Affair and it was good to see Chad keeping them in line. Great set for relaxing into the weekend. Oh, and I got to taste the delicious "Honey Soy Chicken" chips. They are heavenly! I know they sound disgusting, but they're awesome. Chad and I went through 2 bags of those so quickly.   Just as I was about to leave and head off to Sydney Uni, Paulo arrived, scaring the crap out of me cause he just appeared out of nowhere. Poor guy got there too late to see Chad. So, we marveled at Chad being able to get all his gear in his little new trolley - it was very impressive. I was just going to take a bus to Sydney Uni and meet Gavin there. Paulo insists on driving me to Wynyard. I tell him not to be silly. It would take me like 3 minutes tops to walk to Wynyard and wait for a bus. But Paulo being the uber-gentleman insists that he must take me to Wynyard.   That's when I realise he's on his motorcycle. Okay, Mom and Dad, you might want to skip over this part. I start protesting. "Oh, um, actually, I've never been on a motorcycle before - I can walk, I swear." Paulo hands me a helmet. "So, you've never been in an accident before, right," I venture. Paulo says he hasn't, so I put on the helmet, but it won't go on cause my hair bun is huge. I took it out and made it into a pony tail. I'm sure I looked ridiculous, but who cares? So I got on and Paulo said, "You can either hold on to the back of the bike, or put your arms around me." I was like, "Um, sorry, but I'm going to be holding on to you!" I'm sorry, I just don't know how people can feel safe holding on to the back of the bike! I warned Paulo that I might scream. Hell, I didn't know! He said to me gently, "You might get the urge to turn  me  when we turn a corner...please don't." Whatever you say, Captain.   So I held on to Paulo very gently and off we went. HOLY COW! Okay, it is a little scary, but geez that was fun! I can totally understand why people adore their motorcycles. I can see that being very addictive. It totally feels like you're flying. And we only went three blocks. ;-)  Anyway, I suddenly realised I'd had a couple of drinks on a relatively empty stomach (no dinner yet) and I needed to eat something quick, filling, and cheap as it was the end of the month, which means Lori is poor. Sigh. There was only one thing that would do the trick on a price I could afford: a quarter pounder with cheese. So I headed to McDonalds and Gavin rang.   "Where are you?"   "I'm at McDonalds. Dinner!"  Gavin laughed at me. He said he could pick me up. I wasn't going to argue with that. I asked him where I should meet him and I thought he said on George St. where the monorail is. I said okay...I mean, I thought that's what he said, but my mobile is useless and I was just guessing. So we hang up, I get my burger, walk outside and devour it. I may be the slowest eater in the world, but I can eat quickly. It is possible. I was basically walking along the sidewalk inhaling it when this car of young 20-something boys slow down and yell at me, "Woo-hoo! Go BIG MAC!" I put my burger down long enough to yell back, "Go Quarter POUNDER!" They laughed and yelled, "WITH CHEESE? YEAH, BABY!" And thankfully, they took off down the street. I do meet all the winners.   So, I'm where I think Gavin told me to be and realise it's a one-way street. He can't get here. So I call him and he says, "No, keep going down Market Street, over the Pyrmont Bridge." Oh. Doh. "So you want me to walk to your place?" Okay. So I walk...and it shouldn't have taken me THAT long, but I kept stopping to try to use a toilet at Darling Harbour and they were all locked. *POUT* Gavin calls to make sure I haven't been kidnapped. Then Damian calls. "I can't hear the bands," he says. I say, "Yeah, that's because I'm not at Sydney Uni yet....I'm actually, uhhhhh, in Pyrmont.."  Silence. "But we'll be there very soon!" Damian says okay, he'll meet us there.  So I finally get my slow butt to Gavin's and we drive to the Manning Bar. I was going to check out Dap.pled Cit.ies. Fly cause I promised to go, but I wasn't particularly impressed. I mean, they were fine, but absolutely no big whoop whatsoever. Gavin and I entertained ourselves by pointing out things that our non-existent band would never do, that these guys were doing. "Gavin, see that? See that stupid thing he just did with the milk crates? How he made them talk? Our imaginary band would never do that." "Damn, straight, Lori!"    One of the problems, in my humble opinion, was that one of the singers/guitar players thought he was a comedian. Granted, he was funnier than Habib, but that's not saying much. What amazed me, though, much like Habib, was that the audience went wild even when they did dumb things. So, maybe I've become an old fart or something because even though Dap.pled Cit.ies didn't blow my hair back, the kids at Sydney Uni loved them. Either that or they were drunk and/or friends of the band...to be continued...I'll throw in the Bad Manners bit tomorrow!

        The Good Cabbie   I know, most of my cabbie stories involve creepy taxi drivers, but here's a  nice  story about a  nice  taxi driver...    The Streets That Have Our Names   September 7th, 2002  I stuck out my hand to hail the cab speeding towards me on the outer lane. I cringed as I watched the cab sneak in front of an annoyed car in the inner lane to get to me. The other driver was not impressed and blared his horn while mouthing some not very nice words.  The cab stopped in front of me, and I threw open the door and hopped inside. The taxi driver looked like a kindly gentleman you would want as a grandfather.  "Thanks for that," I said.  "No worries, my dear! Now, where can I take you on this lovely day?" He was whistling along to "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."  "Kippax Street, please, Surry Hills."  "Ahhh, Kippax...must be named after the great Cricket player,  urlLink Alan Kippax . We Australians like to name our streets after people." He smiled at me knowingly.  I laughed. "Yes, I picked up on that. It's a nice thing to do, really. Naming streets after interesting people. I just can't believe that in the two years I've worked on Kippax Street, I never thought to ask where that name came from."  He winked at me and smiled warmly. "Maybe they'll name a street after  you  one day."  I laughed harder. "Yes, maybe they will. Maybe we'll both have streets named after us."  He nodded, beaming. "Yes, that would be nice! Very nice indeed!"  I thought for a moment, then said, "So, where would you like your street to be? And what would it be like?"  He sank back into his seat and sighed gently. It was as though he had waited his entire life for someone to ask him this question. "Oh, I'd like it to be on a beautiful tree-lined street, along the ocean, where families would come to picnic and lovers would sit on benches and embrace, just like they do in the movies.  Her hair blowing in the wind, him running his hands through it. He pulls her closer, they hold each other tightly, looking at each other as if they're the only two people in the world. The camera slowly pans across the sea, the trees, the children playing, families eating and laughing, and then the camera slowly zooms in on the happy lovers who are eventually framed perfectly in the shot. They are the only people on the planet. They kiss with a love so powerful, everyone in the audience has to  hold their breath. Fade out... Yes, that would be nice."  I caught my face in the side mirror and noticed my jaw hanging open. "Wow, that sounds amazing. You sound like you should be out making that movie."  He took his eyes off the road for a moment to laugh at me. "If only! But I'm too old. Maybe you can make it for me. You didn't study film at Uni did you?"  "As a matter of fact, I did. One of my degrees was in Film and Television. But it sounds like you could teach me a thing or two!"  "Good to know I've got my director and producer right here. So tell me, where do you want your street to be?"  "Oh, like you, I'd like my street to be near the water. It's got to be a beautiful spot - a relaxing, fun place where children can play and people can go for comfort and inspiration."  He turned to me with a big grin. "I'm sure your street would be quite popular!"  "As would yours, no doubt! Oh - my building is just here. If you could just pull over on the left behind that white van, thanks."  I handed him the money and he handed back my change with a big smile.  "Well, so lovely to have met you - I hope you have a great day."  "Thank you, you too." I got out of the cab and shut the door gently behind me.  He leaned over to the passenger side and called out the window.  "I hope you get your street named after you... I hope we both do!"  I nodded in agreement. "We're obviously going to be famous, so of course we'll have streets named after us!"  "Oh, I hope so. And maybe our streets will be together." He winked again.  "Yes, I think they'll definitely connect....see ya!"

        Bon Voyage, Congratulations, More Sweet Dreams, More Music    Bon Voyage  Going out to Ray's farewell dinner and drinks tonight at some Japanese restaurant in Darlinghurst. Once again I will be acting as the Token Girl of the group. Somebody's got to do it, it might as well be me. We're all jealous Ray's going to get to travel this gorgeous globe for 5 whole weeks!   Congratulations  Belated congratulations to my younger and almost as wise (hehe) cousin, Jeff and his new bride, Amy. My cousin was supposed to be born on June 7th, 1977 and I was supposed to be born on June 17th, 1977. But instead, I popped out on June 7th and Jeff came into this world on June 8th. As most of my friends would say, it was the first and last time I was early for anything in my life. ;-) Anyhoo, we have an ongoing thing where Jeff calls me his older but not-wiser cousin...friendly family banter. In any case, the family tells me that Jeff and Amy looked fantastic and that the wedding was excellent. Sorry I couldn't be there, guys, but if you honeymoon in Oz, I'll happily be your tour guide! ;-)   More Sweet  urlLink Dreams   The never-ending stupid dreams/stupid nightmares saga gets dumber and dumber. I had a bizarre dream last night with a current friend, a current annoying aquaintance, a friend from elementary school, and my 'nemesis' from junior high school. She was this really evil girl who was pissed off that I was 'best friends' with someone else so she went and told all my friends lots of lies, so by the end of 8th grade, I had absolutely no friends to speak of. I had to start over and make all new friends. It was a very bizarre time. I haven't thought about her in ages - here's hoping I don't run into her on George St. or something!   I also had a weird dream where my parents dropped by my apartment to tell me they were concerned that I was never going to get married. It's not too hard to guess where this came from as when I called my parents for their anniversary on the weekend, the topic did come up. I think it's funny that my parents want me to get married, but they don't like the idea of me actually dating. However, as I'm not into the whole  urlLink arranged marriage  thing, I can't exactly skip the dating step. I told my mother that I'm in NO hurry to get married, AT ALL, and I'm not all that concerned about dating at the moment, but she reassured me that I might meet someone someday. Hahahaha. It was really funny - she even suggested that maybe I might run into that guy I met on a plane ride from Cairns to Darwin back in 1998. He was from Papua New Guinea and I wrote a story about him ages ago. I was cracking up on the phone. As if me bringing home a black man from Papua New Guinea would go down well with my family. ("What? He's not Irish?") Personally, I don't have a problem dating anyone from any nationality/background, and I wouldn't let anyone's views stop me from dating someone I liked, but I was laughing that my mom even brought up this guy. Is it a sign of my family's desperation? ;-) Anyway, it was a pretty funny dream, my parents flying 11,000 miles to tell me they're worried I'm never going to get married.   More Music  Going to see  urlLink iOTA  again tomorrow night and must get tix to see  urlLink Shihad  (Pacifier) on the 25th at the Sydney  urlLink Metro . I'm sorry, they may be  urlLink Pacifier  now, but they will always be  urlLink Shihad  to me. They were trying to break into the U.S. market around  urlLink September 11th  last year and people decided that  urlLink Shihad  sounded too much like Jihad and that it wouldn't go down well with the American market, so they became  urlLink Pacifier  (which is also a great song of theirs.) It's a major bummer that the name changed occurred partly to not-offend poor litle Yankees, but hell, as long as they keep playing great music, I don't care what they call themselves.   Oh, I've been forgetting to plug this!  The  urlLink John Butler Trio  are touring the States at the moment, so get your butts down there to see them, you little Yankees. I gave my father their EP for a belated Father's Day present (as Father's Day is in June in the U.S.) because I thought he would be into them, but he still has not really heard it because he has only played right before bedtime and my dad falls asleep in about 30 seconds. I order you to go, Dad! It's only a couple hours out of your life and when's the last time you went to a gig, anyway? Plus, I know you will like them! Also, I have emailed all the little Bostonites out there to be @ the Paradise on September 18th. If you have any faith in me at all (at least musically!), you will go! ;-) They are incredible live!  John Butler Trio September 18th  urlLink Paradise Rock Club  (it's only 8 bucks!) Boston , MA  September 19th Pearl Street Northampton, MA  You'd think I was getting commission or something! Sorry...but I love them, is that a crime?   Thanks to Tim for the link to Ani DiFranco's amazing poem, " urlLink Self Evident " inspired by Sept. 11th. It blew me away.  Have a good weekend, kiddies! And beware of Albania, as poor Rammstein can tell you from personal scary experience. ;-)

        urlLink    A 12-Year-Old Joni Mitchell  I've been told this photo of me playing guitar looks like a 12-year-old Joni Mitchell. Ahhh, if only I could play guitar even remotely like Joni. Alas, no. It's unfortunate as I have a really good guitar. If only its owner were up to par! My Lefty Ovation, my pride and joy. Must start practicing more! I am useless at parties though as I have forgotten all the songs I ever learned (with the exception of "Every Breath You Take" and "Blister in the Sun, " the latter of which I stumbled upon accidentally.) I only know how to play my own stuff, which makes me instantly useless at parties as obviously no one knows my crappy songs!  Oh, thanks to Ray, by the way, for scanning in the pic. This was part of his photography assignment for class.  Also, thanks to Claudine for a wonderful part the other night - lots of lovely people there!  Big  urlLink National Campus Band Competition  bummer - the NSW and VIC State finals are now happening on the same night, so I won't get to go to both. Looks like I'll just be heading down to the National Final in Melbourne at the end of October. In any case, head to a State Final near you if you are able - lots of funky bands cropping up this year!

        Hey Mom and Dad Come look at the TV screen It's the coolest movie I've ever seen Wicked special effects, a visual delight Smoke and screams and fire with editing so tight You'd swear those were real airplanes On some top secret mission, a heroic flight As long as the good guys kill the bad guys Everything is going to be alright  Look at the people running Look at all the people screaming Look at all the people crying Look at all the fireman and police Trying to save all the people from dying I don't recognise any of the actors But they're all so good at playing pretend I don't know the name of this movie But we should rent it from Blockbuster on the weekend I must have turned this on in the middle I don't really understand the plot- do you know who started the fight? As long as the good guys kill the bad guys Everything is going to be alright  Look at the terror on their faces Like New York City's all going to burn and stop I'm on the edge of my seat now Let's make some popcorn, with extra butter on top Wow, so many ant-like people, all jumping from the roof While hundreds of others are trapped inside Where's the heartthrob hero? Where's his big gun? As long as the good guys kill the bad guys Everything is going to be alright  Everyone's running away now, covered in a thick dust I can't believe how real this seems This film's got to be up for Oscars in everything Best Director, Best Sound, Best Screenplay, Best Editing Incredible, one tower just fell, like some great big house of cards Cool, there goes the other one - leaving a great big gaping hole Who was the genius who computer generated this visual delight? Isn't it amazing what they can do with technology today? Imagine if that really happened? Not that anything like that could really happen Sisters and brothers Fathers and mothers Friends and lovers Sons and daughters Husbands and wives None of them are coming home tonight Thank God it's just a movie As long as the good guys kill the bad guys Everything is going to be alright   We miss you, Michelle.

        Left is Right, Right is Left   Before I talk about the left-right, right-left problem, I want to say: Happy Birthday to Claudine! We're going to Mt. Druitt to celebrate tonight. I've never been there before, but I'm sure it will be fun. ;-)  Okay, now I ask you... is the entire world flipping over to the other side? Becoming a mirror image of itself? First, yesterday I read that the  urlLink clitemid=XbeacedhCB&amp;amp;tid=WbbgbgdBI" target="_blank">Google mirror beats the Great Firewall of China , which I think is excellent that the "backwards" Google (in which you have to type everything backwards for the search to work) broke through China's firewall. It helps if you actually have a mirror on hand to help you read the results.   So that's all well and good. Then I get home to my apartment. For those of you who don't know, my apartment building has an entry way that I like to refer to as "the cage." If any freaks are following you home (and you know with me that is a very good likelihood), once you stick your key in, open the cage, and shut the door behind you. You're safe. In the cage. Right, so I've been living in this building for nearly 3 years. I took out my key and went for the cage lock only to discover that something was very wrong.   The door, which had always been on the right, was no on the left. Sometime between 8.30am and 7.30pm yesterday, some dumbass came along and took off the cage door and switched it around so it now opens on the left instead of the right. Huh? Why would you do that? It also opens out instead of in which just feels plain weird considering I've been doing the opposite for years. Is it a big deal? No. Is my life so boring that this is the best I can blog about today? Unfortunately, yes. But I just don't understand the logic of it.   At first I got scared and wondered if they'd changed the locks. That would be something my building would do. Just change the locks without telling anyone. The keys work, but you have to turn them upside down as they don't work the right way up anymore. Just as I got in the cage, my neighbour was coming out. The first thing he said was, "I'm not losing my mind right, the door is on the wrong side, isn't it?" I reassured him that it was. He looked at me, puzzled. "So, when we left for work this morning, the door was on the right and now it's on the left." I confirmed that was correct. "But, why?" I told him I had no idea.   And we laughed.   I said that it made even less sense than when they are painting the inside of our building and the painter thought he'd try to make the tenants feel like they were in "the know" by informing them of the names of the colours being used in the building. He would leave notes in the elevator like, "And the North walls will be painted Deep Forest Vine while the East walls will be painted Golden Amber Honey 10b, etc" and angry residents wrote things like, "Who the hell picked these stupid ugly colours and why are you telling us their names?"  Poor fella. I bet he was crushed.   Amendment: Okay, so I just got a message from a friend who said that it's a fire regulation that all public places must have doors opening outward. That makes sense, I get it. I think it's just weird they put the door on the other side without mentioning it to anyone. Maybe they wanted a good laugh!

        Child of Technology   Okay, I just have to say, that I had a great big warm and fuzzy feeling this morning when I started up my computer to watch  Harry Potter  on DVD while laying in bed with the sunlight streaming through my window. I haven't done this in about 9 months!  It will never replace just reading a good book in bed on a lazy Saturday morning, but it does feel damn good. I'm more excited about the fact I'll be able to finally type up some of my stories.   I saw  urlLink Shay ,  urlLink Fidelma  (the gal with the lovely hair layers), Matt, Fiona (the hardworking gal with very impressive organising skills!) and Sal, and I spent most of the night with Josh, Gavin, and Lisa.  Faker and Big Heavy Stuff did very well @ the Annandale, and I enjoyed them heaps, but to be honest, the most visually entertaining act of the night was the drunk dude dancing in front of me and Josh. As Josh pointed out, this is obviously the guy that Elaine from Seinfield modeled her dance moves after! ;-) (Hey, if you're going to dance badly, you might as well do it for a good cause, and Youth Suicide Prevention definitely classifies as a great one.)  Big sorries to Andrew and Damian whom I didn't get to see last night! :(  I'm online now chatting with JJ and he is cracking me up. I've been catching him up on what a crazy/funny week I've had. Unfortunately none of it is appropriate for blogging, so you'll have to take my word for it. We were saying how my life is like a bizarre sitcom. I asked JJ if my sitcom would get good ratings and he said my sitcom would get great ratings and it would never be cancelled. He also said if my life were a TV show it would be: "Ally McBeal on Crack Meets Twin Peaks." ;-) He has known me for like 12 years now, so he would know!  Off to get myself a feed...."FEED ME, SEYMORE!" (As said in  Little Shop of Horrors   ;-)  p.s. The gang last night said to give big hellos to our favourite former Sydney-sider, Kristikeet! ;-) Oh, and big kudos to you, Kristen, for getting boys addicted to the  Gilmore Girls !

        Viva la computadora!   My computer lives! AMEN!  Dear ladies and gentleman of the internet, I weep before you with astounding happiness. This is the first time I've used my computer successfully (i.e. without it dying or me wanting to kill it) since about May. Yay! Yay! Yay! Huge HUGE thanks to my boys at work! They rock SO hard! :-)  Going to see Big Heavy Stuff and Faker Friday night at the Annandale Hotel - you should all check it out because a) it's two great bands, people! and b) even more importantly, the $10 cover goes to a great cause - youth suicide prevention.   Saturday night methinks there shall be some dancing going on - that is if I get over this annoying uber-tiredness thing I've got going on!  Last night's presentation of the latest Maya software features @ Hoyts George St was pretty cool. Damian thought I was going to kill him for inviting me along, but in spite of the geeky presenters, everything was pretty funky. Makes you really appreciate all those special effects and amazing animating action we take for granted these days.  We also got to see  Reign of Fire  which was worth it just to see Christian Bale and Matthew McConnoughey looking so buff ;-)

        Mission Impossible   It seemed so easy. I've been left to house-sit for Jorge and Ray's apartment, except that I'm not actually living there. I'm just going over there every other day to water the plants and feed the fish, etc. I'm supposed to check their mail too. Who knew that would be the hardest part? I had the keys to the place for a while, but no one told me what key went to what. Ray left on Sunday. He said he would email me "futher instructions." Huh? He said he'd leave the mailbox keys on the kitchen table with more further instuctions. Huh?  So I got an email from Ray in Turkey. The keyboard he was using must have had some Turkish stuff going on as there were tons of symbols and I couldn't make much out. Something about mailboxes being near the main entrance of the building (which entrance is the main one? I think I have gone in and out of their building 5 different ways!) and to not close the  mailbox door all the way or it wouldn't shut. HUH?  So, that's all I had. I emailed Jorge to ask him for more info, in case I got stuck on these.  And I did.  I went over last night for the first time and I never found the bloody mailboxes. It took me a while to figure out which key got you in the front door of the building, and then I realised it wasn't even locked! Hehe! So I got inside and fumbled around for the right keys for the apartment door. People kept going by looking at me like I was breaking in or something. Ooops. So I got inside, fed the fish, watered the plants, took in the laundry from outside. Then I rewarded myself by playing Ray's piano for a half hour. I am sure the neighbours loved it. Ray left me a pile of pics from my "photo shoot" and once again I've proven to be  the  most un-photogenic person on the planet.  I actually look scary in some of the photos and we all know how intimidating I am! The pics are good quality, it's just the subject matter (me) is just not happening on the photos. Oh well!  So, only thing left to do: check the mail. Easy, right?  Wrong!  So I went downstairs by what SEEMED like a logical "main entrance." Nope. No mailboxes. I walked out and then left. Nothing. Went back and turned right. Nothing. Where the hell would the postman have to go? Surely it can't be somewhere difficult? So I did a circle around the whole building and ended up alone in a dodgy alley way with two equally dodgy men walking by and I high-tailed it the hell out of there...  So this morning I get an e-mail from Jorge saying that outside the elevators there is a locked door and I have to use the pink key to open the door that leads to the mailroom. Ah-HA. Great directions, Ray! ;-)  Anyhoo, I'll try again tomorrow!  Tonight I'm off to a 4 hour  Reign of Fire  extravaganza at Hoyts on George Street....

        Kids Today   Just a very quick quickie. On Saturday night I did indeed go see iOTA and Ben Kweller (USA). The funniest thing were these cute little teenagers waiting to get into the venue next to us. A boy and a girl. They looked all of 16 but were probably 18. They were so excited, they looked ready to burst. The boy turned to me and said, "Are you here to see Ben Kweller or iOTA?" and I said "Both." I thought his face was going to break from the huge smile on his face. He was beaming. He searched for the perfect response to my answer..."RAD!" he yelled. Hahahahahaha! I was laughing so hard. I have not heard anyone say "Rad!" in so long.   Anyway, it was nice to see such enthusiasm - he didn't appear to be on anything either, so yay! We ended up sitting with these little punks, who looked like they were in heaven...more about everything later - I gotta get home to see  24 ! I got my priorities straight, alright!  Thanks to the McGuires for actually taking the time to read through my looooooooooooong entries! ;-)

        Signs I Might Be Tired     I start typing things phonetically (i.e. incorrectly) by accident, all the time.  I accidentally e-mail things meant for other people, to myself.   I think of a really hilarious quote on the way home from work and decide to create a silly/fun graphic in photoshop and actually work on said project for half an hour only to realise I've forgotten original funny quote, i.e. the whole frickin' POINT of the project.  Despite item #3, I continue with project, deciding a point is not all that it's cracked up to be.  Reading Kristen's blog about how she was depressed about watching 4 episodes of the  Golden Girls  in one day and feeling really jealous.  I  love  that show and squealed when it came on when I was back in the States in July...(Kristen you have to send me those quizzes and I want to play the online game! Can I be Blanche's wayward daughter? The stupid one who thinks she's going to have 'natural childbirth'?)  Waking up after little sleep, freaking out about how I'm going to be late for work, realise it's Saturday, and then remember that, oh yeah, I  am  going into work today. Doh!  Falling asleep in the shower. I've done this before. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, I wake up, leaning against a wall of the shower, extremely grateful I didn't lean against the only side of the shower without a wall and crack my head open or something.  Accidentally buying....oh god....wait for it... diet  soda. EW! I was aiming for regular pepsi, bought what I thought was regular pepsi, walked outside, opened it, took a big gulp, and felt horrified at the lack of aftertaste/taste in general. How did I miss the huge screaming 'MAX' in PepsiMax??? Disgusting.   Accidentally tattooing my boob. I was getting dressed and something blue caught my eye and I looked down and nearly screamed. What the hell? There was a blue tattoo on my boob! Had a slept through some sort of satanic cult tattooing ritual? Then I realised the tattoo looked familiar. I peered down at the blue stamp on my wrist from the Pacifier/Shihad show at the Metro on Wednesday. Some how, either in the shower, or while I was sleeping, I must have pressed my wrist up to my right boob as I have an identical (albeit sideways) 'tattoo' on the side of my boob. I t looks like I just spent some time in prison.   *yawn* Better go shower and get dressed. I'll try to stay awake in their and loofah the stamps off my wrist and boob.

        And the Loser Lives On   Lori the Loser, that's me. It's 8pm, and what am I doing on my wild Friday night? I'm sitting in the office at work. D-O-R-K! I'm going to go home soonish...because I can work on much of this from there - woo-HOO!  I'm so fun and wild I can't take it anymore! And just when I think I can't get any more exciting, guess where I will be on Saturday and Sunday? You guessed it! Having more website fun! :-)  I'm not really bitter, just sleepy. ;-)  But I am going to go to the lovely Sal's b-day bash tomorrow night. Will be good to see everyone and I've promised Claudine I'd be her dance buddy.   Later taters!

        Silly Girl   I am a very silly girl. I wanted to take Tuesday off from work as a sick day because I felt fluey - the whole bad sore throat, headache, fever, achiness, thing, but it was bad timing as we had this huge website due on Thursday (today.) So I went in and worked most of the day Tuesday and all day Wednesday on the website only to find what I thought (what we all thought) was final work and copy was actually NOT final anything. It was too hard to sift through and look for petty or major differences. What was the quickest thing? Do it all over again. Start from scratch. About four times too, as this person working with us 'accidentally' wrote over my content, after I'd spent a good amount of time putting in the proper html, links, tables,  etc. EXTREMELY frustrating!   Today was crazy. Felt ill, didn't have time for lunch, running around looking for things, trying to make sure it all got done.   Thought I was going to pass out from tiredness. And of course I looked wonderful at work today, all unshowered and wearing the same clothes and undies as yesterday. Yuck. At first I was upset - thought I should have had things done/organised faster, but considering we did most of the site in about 24 hours, I guess it's not so bad! Luckily I always keep deodorant/perfume at work, that helped. I could have killed for a toothbrush though!  Okay, it's 9pm now on Thursday and I haven't slept since 7am on Wednesday. Worked till 6.30pm tonight. Am ready to fall into coma. Good night! :-)  p.s. This is why everyone always wanted me to be in their group for work projects @ Uni/school  - because I'd end up doing everything. Same thing with me being "Editor" (notice the quirky quotations) of my high school yearbook. I have "sucker" and "perfectionist" and "insanely loyal worker" stamped on my head or something.  ;-)

       Hey, hey, hey! Still me! Still here! It's going on 7.30am now. I actually didn't doze off all night. Still plodding through the website content...oy, oy, oy. Am starting to feel verrrrry sleepy! Must keep going...must resist putting head down on desk.   I did go see Shihad last night, briefly. I left for like an hour and a half to go see them, then came back to work. Shihad were fantastic. Their new album does  really  well live and their oldies but goodies still kick ass. If that skinny little boy can rock that hard, maybe there's a chance for me!  Okay, back to work!

           Yeah, Baby, Yeah!   Going to see Austin Powers: Goldmember tonight, finally! Yay! I warned my friends that I would be bringing in a chicken burrito to eat during the movie and if they had any problems with that, they should not sit next to me. What I mean by that is, I know some weird people who freak out if you eat anything other than 'normal' theatre stuff, i.e. popcorn, candy, ice cream during a film. I just don't get it. As long as I don't get it on  you , who cares? Okay, Brian is going to kill me for putting up that pseudo-Austin Powers pic, but that is me as a pathetic Felicity Shagwell (unfortunately I've got nothing on Heather Graham, physically) and that's my homeboy Brian as the cute Austin. The photo still cracks me up after all these years. The CEOs watching us doing a photo-shoot on the roof in Boston and my father agonising over the length of my "dress" - "Why did it have to be that short??????????!" etc. etc.     Jorge's back in town - I had to hang out at his place last night waiting for him to arrive as I have the only keys to his apartment. We caught up and he made me jealous telling me stories about Europe...sigh...this is a pic of me and Jorge at my b-day dinner. Which reminds me I still haven't linked to my b-day photogallery. Ooopsies!

        Is That the Sun?   Okay, this is annoying. I hate trying to go to bed after the sun has already come up! I just arrived home from my Saturday night at 6.30am. What a bizarre night! It all started with just having a stroll down King Street, which included randomly running into Paulo, Rocky, Claudine, Mia, and Marvin. Then we danced to a weird cover band at the Marly Bar. As per usual, a lot of the grandpas seemed to like me. Two 20-something guys asked me to dance and I said I would be happy to dance, like  next  to them, but that I wouldn't dance  with  them.  (i.e. hey, we can all have a dance on the dance floor, but don't touch me!). I had a good time dancing though, despite desperately trying to avoid eye contact with guys...  Later on we met some very interesting characters. A few tips for guys trying to hit on girls:    Don't lie about your age. If you're a baby, just admit you're a baby and be done with it. We're going to find out eventually, and we usually know you're lying up front, which ensures you will never see us again.  Don't blatantly stare at a girl's boobs when she's talking to you. A little subtlety goes a long way.  Speaking to a gal for about 20 minutes does not automatically entitle you to the whole back/hair/waist touching thing. We understand that you are doing this so as to "mark your territory" as there are heaps of other guys around who might be trying to move in, but we're not trees, so don't piss on us.   Don't act like an idiot and be an ass because a girl's not reciprocating romantic or lusty feelings and then act all shocked when she  still  doesn't want to hang out with you later on.   Don't lie about what you do for a living. Much like the age thing, we're going to find out about it. And please, if you're going to tell a fib, at least make it sound plausible. Women like to believe you think they have an IQ about 80.  Just take no for an answer. etc. etc   When the Marly closed we went to the Bank Hotel until they closed and then we ended up at the Town Hall and bumped into more people. All in all a very entertaining evening!  Good night!

           Onions Make Me Laugh   Sometimes onions make me cry, but  The Onion  kills me with laughter. My latest favourite is:   Bush Seeks Support for "U.S. Does Whatever It Wants" Plan   This photo is of Picasso's 'The Lovers' which I took @ The Picasso Museum in Paris in July. I really love the colours of this piece and it's got a great energy about it - it's something I'd love to have hanging in my dining room one day (I wish!) ;-)

           Freak Magnets Unite!  And Random Thoughts on Friendship   Here we are, the original Freak Magnets, me and Kristen. This was taken in July this year, in Boston. Kristen and I had gone to my favourite Colombian Restaurant and then we met up with Shayna for drinks. Shayna thought we were super freaks for wanting to take this pic in the middle of the sidewalk, but oh well.   I've been thinking about friendships lately. I have a lot of very good friends, all around the world. But isn't it funny how people become friends? Some people you click with instantly. Other people slowly grow into friends over time. Some friends you only discuss superficial things with. Some friends you only discuss deep things with. The best ones are the ones you can discuss everything with.  But with friends that grow slowly - at what point did you cross that line from acquaintances to friends? When did you decide that you could keep each other's secrets? When did you know you could trust them?   And isn't it amazing how friends come in cycles? People I was tight with a year ago I hardly ever see now and friends I barely saw a year ago I see all the time now. And some friendships stand the test of time, distance, lack of contact etc. You can pick them up where you left off. And some friendships change and you can never get them back to where they were.  All very complicated and all very simple at the same time. I guess I just want to thank my friends for being my friends - I know I can be pretty difficult to get a hold of and stay in touch with sometimes. Thanks for not giving up on me :-)

        urlLink    Hallelujah! & Scary Things I Come Up With When I'm Sleep Deprived   Ding-dong the website is dead! Okay, actually, it's not dead, it's just gone live, but it's "done." For now. Still more stuff to do on it, but I am actually going to bed soon as it's okay enough to go live - yay!  So I got home from work at 11pm on a Sunday. It's just another thing for me to put in the "things I've done that I hope to never do again" list.  Spent most of the day in the office today, and most of it in the office yesterday. Thank god I went to Sal's b-day shindig last night or this would have been the lamest weekend of my entire life. (Thank you to Claudine for saving me from myself...I had fallen asleep on Saturday night and her phone call woke me up in time to get my butt to the Civic Hotel!) Sal looked absolutely beautiful last night and  urlLink Mr. Shay  was looking extremely dapper! A very snazzy couple indeed!   Miss  urlLink Fidelma  made me laugh when we were walking down the street, everyone freezing except for me, and said, "Damn you Americans and your good winter coats!"  And I laughed and protested, "But I got this here! In Sydney! For 10 bucks!" And it's true, I found this cute little winter jacket on sale, marked down from $69 to $10. I couldn't resist. Owen says it looks like I'm wearing a sheep, but I don't care - I love it. And it's not really wool, thankfully, as I'm basically, allergic to anything with hair....sigh.  Even funnier is that about 5 minutes later Shay said something similar about my jacket and once again I insisted I got the jacket here, in good ol' Oz. So there you have it...Australians may not have central heating in most homes, but dammit, they do have some really warm winter coats, on sale for $10, no less. You just have to be as thrifty (read: poor) as me to notice ;-)   Nah, I'd still buy cheap clothes even if I was rich as I am the biggest slob/klutz of all time and I would only eventually spill spaghetti sauce on something expensive, or trip and fall and get a big tear in it. I rarely buy anything over $30 clothing-wise. That way, if something happens to it (and something will, mind you), it's not a big deal.  Remember, I am the granddaughter of a woman who broke her collarbone playing poker. I've accepted my genes and I am acting accordingly. ;-)  I spoke to the lovely Kristen this evening. She rang while I was at work. It was a great/funny/fantastic conversation for the most part, but it got beyond stressful when Kristen heard a fight breaking out on her street and noticed people screaming and fleeing from a bar across from her apartment.  She thought this guy might have had a gun. She thought she heard a gunshot, which would explain why people were screaming and running.  I was freaking out..."Ohmygod, get the hell away from the window, Kristen! Get down! Get down on the ground! Stay there!"  By the time we hung up, things were under control, at least I hope so!   Scary Things I Do When I'm Sleep Deprived   Now to explain that dodgy 'magazine cover'...Yeah, so I took a half hour this weekend to procrastinate from working on that damn website to come up with this rather pathetic attempt at humour. I was just a few brain cells short of funny, but the main thing was that Ray took this photo of me, as you can see, where I look like I'm some pre-pubescent 12 year old teenybopper trying to  make it in the entertainment industry...and the rest is history. (Note to my cousins: Yes, I'm being sarcastic! ;-)  p.s. Big thanks to Rammstein - I just got your virtual/actual postcard and it rocks! Long live the Nerds of the Night! ;-)

        Dancing Till the Sun Comes Up...   I pretty much did this at Owen and Clive's party on Saturday. We had the pleasure of being DJ'd to by another co-worker of mine and Owen's - good ol' Daniel. The Primes really now how to prepare a house for a party. They'd ingeniously covered all floors of the house with cardboard so there would be virtually no clean-up in the morning - just have to throw out the cardboard. Clive even thought to put down pieces of paper covered in trivia all over the house - very amusing!   Should have some pics of the party courtesy of Karin and Owen soon. Karin's got some terrible pictures of me dancing, ummm, terribly! ;-) I almost succeeded in going to a party without any embarassing event happening until someone walked in on me peeing - even though I had locked the door. I was not counting on someone having a key to the door! Sigh...  Except for that horrible moment, the rest of the evening was heaps of fun. Thanks to the Prime boys for being such good hosts and thanks to Dan for the tunes!

If only I'd left a nice outfit here at work - now I have to go home and change. :(     The creepy face things you see are one of the weird things we found up in Newcastle over the weekend.

        Film Critics, Take Notice!   Actually, forget film critics -  everyone  take notice! There are some fantastic up & coming student filmmakers, and to be honest, they're really not so much up & coming as actually here. They are officially 'arrived.'  Went to the  National Student Film & Video Fesetival  tonight @ Sydney Uni's Manning Bar. It was a crap night weather-wise but a nice crowd turned out for the evening. The showed the first and second place films for all the categories and the evening was hosted by Mr. Jay Katz, who has a lovely old-fashioned voice and I mean that as a compliment.   I'll have more of a story about this on Yap soon, but just wanted to make mention of it - I was very impressed by the excellent selection. I hope to see some of these filmmakers in Tropfest in February as I think Tropfest could use a boost!

        Newcastle: A  Wild and  Crazy Sorta Town   First of all, I just have to say it: Newcastle, NSW Australia is a bizarre little place. It's 'hip and happenin' venues, pubs, restaurants, etc. are generally packed into tiny stretches of streets here and there, leaving most of the city looking like a ghost town even on Friday and Saturday nights. I can't remember how many times we walked around saying, "Um....where IS everybody??? It is Friday/Saturday night, isn't it?"  The people that turned out for the student media/writing/music/art (or, not art) festivals were as mind-boggling as Newcastle itself. Never have I seen such a diverse selection of dread-locks and bohemian-punked out peeps all in one place.  I tried to pay attention to the discussion panelists, but with so much hot pink hair glowing nearby, it was all a bit distracting. Even more distracting were some of the questions people were asking. ;-)  All in all, it was a fun weekend. We had some really great panels and some really shocking ones. Highlights included "DIY TV" with Santo Cilauro, Courtney Gibson and Jennifer Collins, a hilarious kick-ass presentation by Tom Frank ("One Market Under God"), and panels on advertising and music journalism including Andrew Maloney and Craig New (respectively) and I'm not just sucking up because the last 2 guys are my friends. ;-) I'm too lazy to write about any more panels, so I'm sticking with that.  Other highlights included going to the Art Gallery to see this creepily cool collection of technology/media presentations. My favourite would have to be the one that let us take pictures of ourselves then transform our faces into weird/scary/alien-like mugs. It's called ' Personal Eugenics .' We also went to this musical extravaganza at the Cambridge Hotel. Much like Newcastle and the entire festival weekend, it was bizarre. There was some amazing electronic things happening in one room, while some terrible chick was ruining "Private Dancer" in another room. Different artists rotated throughout the night in the various rooms, but I'm so glad to we opted to try the last room (where all the good stuff was), if only to escape the freaky people in the middle room. You can only take so much of weird self-indulgent people in leather/latex/corsets taking turns 'dancing' and 'singing' to programmed beats. The tension of whether or not this one girl's bosoms were going to fall out of her corset was just too much. I definitely didn't want to see that. So, we moved, and we found some very cool stuff.   If anyone who currently lives in Newcastle or has lived in Newcastle happens to be reading this (though I can't imagine how you'd ever find my blog), I'm dying to know what is going on with Newcastle cabbies!   First off: All the cabbies we actually had were incredibly sweet! This one gentleman was so careful and considerate. Shay and I had to squeeze into the front seat as there was an empty baby seat in the back and first he asked Shay if the air-conditioning was fine for him, then he asked me if I was okay with it. What a champ!  So while the cabbies we had were lovely, the cabbies we  didn't  have were puzzling and we  didn't  have a lot more cabbies than we  did  have. Confused? Okay, on Sunday night we had something like 4 or 5 cabs head towards us. We waved madly to hail the cabs. And what did the drivers do? Did they pull over and pick us up because they were empty and their light was on? No. Not only did they not stop to pick us up - they pulled a U-turn and turned around and high-tailed it the hell out of there, speeding down the street in the opposite direction. WTF??? Maybe in Newcastle it's un-hip to earn $ as a cab driver?  In any case, Newcastle remained very mysterious to us. There were lots of really lovely places - great little/big pubs, cafes, restaurants etc, but no one was in most of them! What was going on? Maybe a lot of Newcastlelites left town for the weekend? I don't know...but I do have to point out that one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen at a pub occured @ the Great Northern Hotel. Now, the GNH has a ton of potential as far as I'm concerned. Lots of comfy seats, nice layout, great dance floor, but all was not right with this world! The DJ was in the section of the pub with the main bar - which is totally no where near the actual dance floor. I know I tortured poor Sal, Shay, and Fidelma who had to listen to me jabber on repeatedly about this. "WHAT? But he's not even in the same room as the dancers! How can you DJ to people you can't even see?" The dude would sometimes speak into the mic @ the dancers, but it was very "man behin the curtain" a la Wizard of Oz since no one dancing could actually see him.   We had a super breakfast on Sunday at this cool cafe with overly-nosy but plenty-cute waiters, and I took a picture of Shay's plate, which I will post here soon, but my most notable meal of the weekend would have to be my chip-sandwich. How have I been here so long without ever hearing of this? I thought the gang was joking when they mentioned making chip sandwiches, but nope. They bought a loaf of bread, we ordered a HUGE portion of french fries with chicken salt and piled the chips between the bread with our sauce of choice (tomato, bbq, or gravy.) Pretty yummy!  We had a freaky thing happen during our McDonald's pit stop on the way back to Sydney tonight. Fidelma asked for some tomato sauce for her chips and they gave her green ketchup. Is this big in the States now?? In any case, it looked SO weird to see her putting this foresty green goo all over the french fries. Looked like a science experiment gone wrong. ESPECIALLY when the green sauce made it to the hamburger...but I was intrigued and asked for a pack of green sauce for my french fries. The sauce tastes the same, if not sweeter, but stupid me didn't open up my pack quite enough and when I squeezed, most of the packet shot out, splurting an impressive arc over the table and onto the floor.  The Klutz strikes again!  Anyway, it was a very fun weekend. Our hotel rocked! (Thanks, Fidelma!) It was great to get out of Sydney for a while, but boy was it nice to drive back into Sydney and see the beautiful sky-line and other signs of civilisation. And as Shay pointed out, it was comforting to see pubs packed with people! Thanks to Shay for his superb driving and thanks to Sal for exchanging stories about difficult clients with me. Oh! And thanks to Shay for teaching me some fun card games, but don't think you're getting out of learning 'golf,' mister! ;-)

         Show Me the Money, Politics, and Angry Idiots of the Night, and Hitting My Funny Bone Ain't Funny    Show Me the Money  Today I helped an elderly Asian man use the ATM. He spoke no English, so I was impressed by my use of charades and what-not. He came up to me while I was getting my own money out of the ATM and I was not impressed. I was like, "hey, now, a little personal space please!" He held up his Commonwealth Bank card and gestured at the machine questioningly. I nodded and said he could use the machine. He went up to the machine and looked at me again. I took his card and stuck it in the ATM for him, then pointed to the number pad for him to put in his pin. I didn't know whether or not to leave him at this point, so I stood back. He looked at me again when it came time to choose how much money to take out.  I pointed at a 'reasonable' amount and crossed my fingers that 'savings' was the right option. I also opted for the receipt. I kept holding up my card, my wallet, and my receipt as cues. It was funny because he freaked out when it took a few moments for his card, and then his money, and then his receipt. I was somehow gesturing, "relax, it's coming" though I don't know how. Anyway, he got his money, he was happy.     Politics 'n' Stuff & Angry Idiots of the Night  Last night I hung out with K and N in Forest Lodge. We chatted for like 4 hours about freaks, IT and design, politics, etc, you know, the important things! It was a lot of fun and I was very sleepy when I got home so you can imagine my disgruntled state at 2am when some tool on the street decided to stand outside my apartment building and yell, "AMANDA! AMANDA???? AAAA-MAAAAN-DAA! Wake up! WAKE UP!" He went on, and on, and on.  I was like, "Please Amanda, wake up and tell him to shut up!" I really wanted to go to my window, open it up and tell him to go away or I would call the police. Then I started wondering if maybe this wasn't the nut-job who used to beat the crap out of his girlfriend about 2 years ago. The couple lived 2 doors down and one incident of domestic violence ended with him putting her through the glass balcony doors and then dragging her into the hallway, down the stairs, and outside the building, bleeding everywhere. I never knew the guy or girl's names. I never really got a good look at either of them, just quick looks out the door/window at night before ringing the police. Haven't heard a peep from them in like 2 years so I didn't know if they moved out or what. I still no pretty much no one in my building. It's a ghost town, my building. Anyway, the dude outside yelled for about 2 hours on and off...every time I got up to ring the police, he'd stop. Psychic bastard. I hope Amanda is okay, whoever she is.   My Funny Bone Ain't Laughing  Well, it's finally happened. I've finally injured myself while telling a Lori-story. I'm actually surprised it hasn't happened before, given my klutz-status and penchant for telling so many long-ass-please-get-to-the-point stories.  So last night I was telling a tale of Foxwoods and gambling and was in the process of demonstrating pulling the lever on a slot machine (why this needed to be demonstrated, I have no idea), and I basically forgot there was a living room table therer and I smashed my elbow into it. OWIE! I had tears forming in my eyes, which I casually blinked away and I continued with the story as if I hadn't just stupidly slammed my stupid elbow into the stupid table. Yup, I talked over even the embarassment. Okay, so maybe not as impressive as Kerri Strug (is that her name?)  continuing in the Olympic gymnastics despite breaking her ankle, but in the non-athletic sport of telling stories, I was pretty amazed by my will to go on. My elbow and arm are severely bruised today. At first I thought that there was a tiny chance I had a hairline fracture or something as it hurt to move my wrist, and my pinky and ring fingers were numb, but I think I just banged it up good. I got it right on the bone, so what do I expect?   The photos are of me and Karin, and me and Clive at the Prime Party last Friday. Good times!

        urlLink    National Campus Band Comp - Melbourne or Bust   Yay, I love packing for Melbourne. :-) It's  urlLink Band Comp  time again folks. The National Final takes place Thurs. night, October 24th at The Corner Hotel in Richmond. Be there! My plane leaves @ 5pm, so I will have to haul ass to the hotel straight from the airport. Got the video cam, the digital cam, and regular cam. I better get some good footage!  Also very much looking forward to catching up with all my cute little Melbourne punks, you know who you are. I'm very lucky to have such nice friends to stay with in Melb, won't have to worry about the joys of a hostel.   So yeah, I'm off tomorrow night, and then will stay the weekend, coming back to Syd. on Sunday arvo. Happy Birthday for Friday the 25th in advance to my Daddy. Congratulations, Dad! You'll be 50, and twice my age, and still younger than Patrick Swayze who turned 50 in August (I'm sick, I know!) And Happy Belated B-day to my lil' cousin Seanie T! (I know, I know, you're not that little! ;-)  This pic is another one from the last party @ The Primes, a nice group shot. I don't know how I always manage to end up in the middle of group photos. I don't plan it, it just kinda happens. Weird.  Have a great one, folks. Looking forward to telling tales when I get back..."This one time, at Band Comp..." ;-)

        Food, More Food, Bugs, Babies, and BBQs   Let's see...trying to re-cap from end of last week...Thursday night I had dinner @ this Greek restaurant in Newtown with Glenn...he should be a stand-up comedian, I tell you. We were exchanging funny stories about all sorts of things, including former roommates and anyone who knows me knows I've had my share of crazy roommates. ;-)  Friday I had dinner @ this German restaurant in Darlinghurst...I ordered the goulash to see if it was anything like the Goulash my Grandma used to me. You know what, it's nothing like it! It wasn't bad, but it was an entirely different species. Grandma's goulash kicks ass!  Saturday I did I did a lot of walking around, some reading and writing - caught up with Lis, Angela, Meredyth, and Leslie on Saturday nite. We spent a lot of time sitting around and talking about cockroaches, spiders, other creepy bugs. Yes, guys, you've always wanted to know what girls talk about - not naked pillow fights, men, dating, or foreplay. We talk about bugs. And our tactics for killing them. ;-) Lis and Meredyth went home first, and I stayed with Angela and Leslie...about 20 minutes later, Lis and Meredyth are back @ the pub...we were like, 'what's wrong?' They came back because there was a big bug in the bathroom and they were too scared to use it. Hehe! So Angela had to go home and remove the sucker. Turned out to be a cricket. I've never seen a cricket in Oz. Apparently the yankees said that the cricket didn't look like a yankee cricket. Whatever that means.  I kept seeing babies this weekend. Saturday and Sunday. I know babies are everywhere and I see them everywhere, but this weekend in particular I was feeling extra clucky! Every baby seemed extra beautiful. It was all I could do from going over to stranger's babies and asking them if I could please pick up their child. Seriously, I wanted to! Babies always smile at me - probably because I'm funny looking, but still! ;-) I just kept going, 'awww!' over their little smiles and their little hands with their itty bitty little fingernails....I mean, I do 'awwww' over baby shoes for pete's sake...does anyone have a baby I can hold or baby-sit for a bit? I just want to play a few rounds of paddy-cake, and then I'll give him/her back! ;-)  Sunday was a luscious BBQ at Owen & Clive's. YUMMY! Once again, the Prime boys have outdone themselves. They had a Prime Sausage Tasting. We were each given scoring sheets to rate the moisture, flavour, meat quality of each type of sausage. They had Prime Originals 1 + 2, Honey Soy, Chilli, and Lamb & Rosemary. They were ALL good, but I really loved the Honey Soy, Lamb & Rosemary, and Original 1. Damn, now I'm hungry. Clive also made all sorts of yummy side dishes. I had intended to actually make some kind of dessert but when I woke up on Sunday morning, I was just laying in bed going, "Nah, not gonna happen." So I bought some goodies at Michel's instead. Strawberry Gateau and Blueberry Cheesecake. Damn, now I'm REALLY hungry.   Hoping to go to Melbourne this weekend, but not sure if I can get Friday off yet, so fingers (and toes!) crossed Would be good to see the National Campus Band Comp Final action and Dave/Ian/Angela/Chris/Fleur/ + posse! Just checked flights to Melbourne - yikes, they're filling up fast!  Thanks to Kristen for leaving 2 hilarious messages on my voicemails.  Both of which are making fun of me on my voicemail messages. I saved one of them, which still cracks me up, on like my 15th listen. It starts off with Kristen doing a really great imitation of me on my mobile phone. She says my message sounds like phone porn. And she's not the first to say that. I don't think I've ever heard my voicemail before, so I have no idea...perhaps it's time to change that??? ;-) We will chat soon, Kristikeet, I promise!   Mom and Dad, I am alive, and yes, I still think you should come to Oz in February - I will ring you soon, and yes, Dad, I have completely forgotten that it's your 50th birthday this Friday. :-)

        Happy Anniversary to Me   Today marks my 3 year anniversary in Australia. THREE years! I cannot believe I've been here that long. THREE bloody years. Geez, time flies by fast....now my family will remember these last three years as the QUIETEST years of their life, with chatterbox Lori out of the country. As one of my co-workers used to say, I 'can talk under water' ;-)  I do miss you guys (talking about my family and old friends here) - all I can say is, appreciate the silence while you can!

        Happy Halloween!   Went out to dinner in Newtown last night with Gavin and Glenn...we had red curry barrimundi and bbq chicken with sweet chilli sauce (I can hear my family and Kristen licking their lips with jealous hunger! ;-)  I have more funny cab adventures coming soon (I know, I really have to stop taking cabs), but now it's time to go to bed. I'm laughing over my two most recent purchases at the book store.... 1)  After the Darkest Hour: How Suffering Begins the Journey to Wisdom  and  Foundations of Clinical Psychiatry .  There's no need to worry folks, I'm A-OK...the first book takes a very Buddhist perspective on life/philosophy/chaos/fate/luck etc. which is pretty interesting because it's obviously very different to what I believed when growing up. The clinical psych book is a good reference book...I swear I'm not trying to classify the crazies I meet as I'm walking down the street - alas they don't make a purse-sized version of this book just yet ;-)  I was going to tell some Halloween tales of old, i.e. trick or treating stories and fond memories of scaring the crap out of poor unassuming  trick or treaters, but maybe tomorrow!  Don't forget to brush your teeth, kids!

        Stunned in Syney   I'm in shock. Two good friends of mine are in the middle of something terrible. Today I found out that one of them actually went through with a threat they had made. I can't believe it. What happens to people that they can go ahead and purposely hurt the people that they love the most?  It doesn't make sense - none of this makes sense. There was no reason for any of this to get ugly. No reason at all. And most of all, there is  no  acceptable excuse for this outcome.  None.

        Me so tired!   Oy...I'd love to tell y'all about my weekend in Melbourne and the Band Comp and meeting up with my Melbournite posse, but I'm too damn tired - maybe tomorrow? Gotta be up early - have to get my butt to the train station by 7.30 am to be at an early morning meeting about an hour away...wheeeeee!  Happy belated b-day to Dad!  Cheers! -Lozza :-)

        Miss Home Improvement? Me? Not a chance...   So basically I loathe my apartment. It is ugly. Really really ugly. And tacky. It looks like a motel. Because it is, or was. My apartment building used to be a 'hotel' - and that's not surprising considering the state it was in when I first moved in. My friends and I call it 'the 1-star motel.'  When I first moved in, I removed the tasteful soft porn paintings of Japanese women and shoved them in the closet. I removed the ugly couch/bed coverings and hid those in the closet, along with my tacky lampshades, the hotel phone, and so on. My living room closet looks like a graveyard for tacky motel pieces.   Oh yes, my place is fully furnished - with tacky furniture. I haven't felt like investing in re-decorating because I didn't know what was going on with the working visa. I'd really like to move - but I don't have the money to buy furniture and I don't want to make the commitment to buying furniture either - so I'm just going to do a bit of re-decorating. Nothing major -  just new curtains, some throws for the couches, some throw rugs, etc. with an actual colour scheme. That's right - things in my apartment may actually match! (Gasp!)   I have to do something. I mean, my apartment came with a frickin' Bible in the night-stand, after all. How motel is that?  So I've picked my colours. Blue, green, and purple - these will be my new colours in my new & improved (okay, just improved) apartment.   So, I found curtains that I'm in love with - isn't that sad? To be in love with curtains? I've been staring at ugly thick polyester pink curtains from hell for 3 years. Buh-bye! The new dream curtains are green and blue at the top with this cool Chinese pattern, and then a pretty bright sheer blue the rest of the way down. I adore them (see, it's the little things that make me happy.) The other curtains are a sheer grape/purple.   Now, to prove to you even more how dumb I am, I just bought them, without giving any thought to how they would be put up. I have never actually bought curtains before. I just assumed they slid on the curtain rod. Then, when going to take down my ugly-ass pink polyester curtains I discovered that they didn't 'slide' on the curtain rod - they had a thousand little pins hooked up to these plastic hooks. Yuck. I opened up my new curtains. They require the whole curtain rod sliding thing. Doh, Lori - there are nails that need to be unscrewed. This situation would require....doh...a screwdriver.  Of course I had already taken down my ugly curtains and could not stand to put those suckers back up. I knew I owned screwdrivers....and I knew they were somewhere....probably in my closet (don't ask!) I have not used them since I moved in 3 years ago. I needed them to put together my desk and I haven't used them since. I actually found them in my closet, which was amazing. (In the process, I also found my little teddy bear, Hermes - don't ask me how he got in there!)   What was not amazing was my precarious situation on my unstable swivel office chair which is not high enough to be very effective. I was standing on my tip toes getting my old curtains off, and then I was trying to undo screws while on tippy toes while standing on an unsteady swivelling chair. As if I'm not accident prone while standing still on steady ground.   I found 3 screwdrivers, none of them a Phillips head. Of course that's exactly what I needed. I lent the Phillips head to a friend years ago and didn't make much of an effort to get it back, since I only use screwdrivers like once every three years. How useless am I? All I wanted was to hang up my pretty curtains!   So I went to bed with no curtains last night - boy is that sun helpful at 5am! ;-) So tonight, after work, I went and bought a set of small screwdrivers, including 2 Phillips heads, one of which I assumed would be the right size because I'd 'eyed' the nails. Hahahahahahaha. Yeah right. So, I ran home, whipped out the screwdrivers and they were both too small. :(   So, back to KMART again. This creepy KMART employee kept following me around and smiling at me and looking me up and down and saying, "Good morning!" It was 9.30pm....Anyhoo,  I bought 2 more bigger Phillips head screwdrivers and ran home, excited to get the damn curtains up.  Neither of these screwdrivers worked either! At least not at first - I think the main problem (other than me just being me) is that I'm not up high enough - it's hard trying to unscrew something when you're two feet too low and standing on tippy toes, losing feeling in your arms from stretching up in the air. Finally got one nail out and put on one curtain, which took me about 20 minutes because I was struggling to pull the rod out enough to get it on, one curtain holder at a time. I decided to try standing on my desk to get to the other side. I was wary of this, because I put the desk together myself and was not very confident in its sturdiness, but dammit, it held me just fine (*rare proud moment*.) I got the other screw out easy as pie because I was tall enough. And of course, this is when the entire rod fell out. DOH! I had stupidly and needlessly struggled with the other curtain when I could have taken the whole thing off. So getting the second one on was easy.....but putting the curtain rod back into place and screwed in was something else. I'm sadly going to be sore tomorrow. (Very pathetic, I know). ONE HOUR LATER, I have curtains up! Yay! I love them, so that's something!  But I'm going to have to go through all this again in the living room too? *Sob* Can you imagine if I tried to do something in my apartment that actually required skill,  if I had this much trouble hanging curtains? Very sad....though I swear a little step ladder would help my sad self out a lot I think...  If only I had some 8-foot tall friends ;-)

        Melbourne Cup Madness   I have to give Australia credit - there's none of this half-assed appreciation of sports - it's all or nothing, baby! Yesterday was the big Melbourne Cup hoopla. It's just a horse race...(I can hear several friends screaming, 'It is not  just  a horse race,  Lori!' ) but anyway, to me, it's just a horce race. Nothing bad about that - I like picking my favourite horse by the coolest name etc, etc, but what I like most about the Melbourne Cup is the excuse to stop working for most of the day.   We all moseyed down to the pub for a lovely lunch and some drinks around 1.30pm. Ummmm, I left the pub around 11pm and some of my co-workers were still there.  Gotta love the funny tipsy conversations between co-workers that occur at the pub after 9 hours!  I'm doing well so far n my 'challenge' for the week. I'm not allowing myself any major caffeine (so no coffee, no caffeinated teas, no carbonated beverages), and nothing fried for a whole week. Trying to drink lots of water, etc. I have a can of V sitting in the office fridge, but I will not touch it this week, dammit!  Mum and Dad - got your voicemail - will ring you guys sometime in the next couple days! The time change is different now - so check my blog to see what time it is ;-)  Special K (my fave Seattlelite!), your html goddess will write with answers very soon! ;-)

        Ohhhh, I-eeeee-iiii I-iii, I'm Still Alive Ehhhh ohhhh, I-eee-iii I-iii, I'm Still Alive   Sorry, couldn't help it. That was my typed rendition of Pearl Jam's "Alive" - did you recognise it? No? Okay, nevermind ;-)   Pearl Jam Update  I missed out on Pearl Jam tix for their first concert today (*pout*) but I got tix for their 2nd concert, on the 13th of February at the Sydney Entertainment Centre. I got Row S. Hrmph. Well, that's better than last time, when I was in Row X. However, Row X was really Row Z (up against the wall) so the only way I could have been further back this time is if I was actually standing outside. Oh well, it's taken me four years to move five rows closer, but what can you do. I'll try to remember to bring binoculars this time!   Sculptures by the Sea  My lazy slacker self has still not put up pics from last weekend. Last Saturday I did the walk from Bondi Beach to Coogee Beach - finally! Kristen and I tried to do that walk a couple of years ago, but were unsuccessful because it was dark, we couldn't see where we were going, there was some creepy bagpiper following us, and we were tired.  My favourite part (other than the creepy bagpiper of course) was when we were walking in pitch blackness and I started squinting going, "Um, are those gravestones? Kristen, are we in a cemetary?" And yup, we were! Anyway, it was nice doing the walk this time around in the DAYTIME like a normal person. It took me about two hours, not bad considering I kept stopping to take pics.  "Sculptures by the Sea" was on last weekend and I highly recommend you go this weekend (it's the last weekend!), if you haven't seen it. Really cool amazing sculptures have been set up on the rocks by the ocean from Bondi Beach to Tamarama Beach. I will  eventually  have pics up of some of my favourite pieces.   Decorating Dork  And the apartment cleaning/decoration continues. I didn't get nearly enough cleaning/decorating done this week. My apartment looks like a hurricane passed through. I'm going through and throwing a lot of crap out - it's long overdue. And lo and behold I got a phone call from my stupid idiotic incompetent real estate agent this week. They want to come look at my apartment to figure out what it's worth in case the landlord wants to sell it. Don't know if the landlord wants to sell it, like, now, in which case I'd have to move out, but we'll see. The agent is coming by on Monday, so I feel pressure to hurry up and get my apartment looking better, which is annoying. Maybe I should leave it as it is - then they can recommend to the landlord never to sell it, no one would buy. ;-)    Curtain Chaos  More curtain chaos. I decided I didn't want the purple curtains in my bedroom, just the blue ones. So of course that meant going through the fun I blogged about not so long ago...and guess what? The screws were barely having any effect on the curtain rod.  They were basically in there, just for show, and pretty much fell out as soon as I touched them with my screwdriver. (How did this happen???) So, it appears that for the last week, my curtain rod has been held up by magic. Lovely. Oh, well, at least I got the purple off, the blue/green on, and the rod is still up by magic, plus more help from the screws this time. It was worth it, dammit, the blue curtains alone look luscious! Love it! Yeah, I know, I'm sad, I'm getting excited about curtains.   I'm on Hiatus  As most of you probably know, I've been on a self-imposed 'dating hiatus' for a while now. Yes, it's my decision to be dateless at the moment, and I'm happy with this choice. (I mean, it's not like I couldn't pick from a wide variety of local freaks to go out with!) What is utterly baffling to me, though,  is that since I went cold-turkey, the most non-relationshippy friends I have went jumping through dating hurdles at top speed. People I know who couldn't handle 2 consecutive dates with the same person are now celebrating 8 month anniversaries. Even several my gay guy friends are in long-term relationships, no offense to them, but it is a fairly rare thing! I'm happy for them all, but it's a wacky, crazy world, I tell ya. Is there some sort of dating quota? I.e. I stop dating, so my friends have to up their dating quota in order to make up for my zero count? ;-) It's all about choices though, and I'm happy with mine. :-)   Writing Weekend  Better be off to bed, I've got to be up early for a Writer's Weekend. I'm taking a Life Writing Workshop on Saturday and Sunday, starting at 9.30 (sigh), so I better catch some Zzzzzs, that sunlight will be streaming through in no time!

        Cameo Appearance   Hello, people! Just wanted to write something to confirm once again that I am still alive. So exciting, isn't it? Wish I had the energy to update my ever so patient family/pals, but I'm zonked. Going to bed now, but I'll write something vaguely informative soon and I'll be chatting to y'all family people on Thanksgiving, your time. ;-)  p.s. Kudos to Reece's Pieces for accomplishing so much while I was busy being a slacker sleeping on the other side of the globe. You go, girl!

        Too Behind   A list of lately:  Happy Belated Thanksgiving - it was good talking to the Irish side of my family for 2 hours last week - it was actually worth getting up at 6am even though I had to hear the frustration in my 13-14 year old cousins' voices at hearing that I still had no share-able boy gossip for them. ;-)  My Life writing course from a couple weeks ago was fantastic. I even won one of my tutor's novels, which is based on her real life depression, nervous-break-down, stints in and out of psychiatric hospitals, and suicide attempt. Very grueling reading about such things when you  know  the person, but thankfully I knew that there was a positive ending. It's a very amazing novel.   Apartment decoration 201...the apartment is slowly but surely getting better. In fact, not to toot my own horn or anything, but it just might be the 1.25 star motel now. I may have moved up a quarter of a star - wheeeeeee!  I no longer make any eye-contact with anyone on the street my office building is on as it has been taken over by  construction workers building and tearing stuff down all up and down the street, on both sides. There's nothing like cat-calls first thing in the morning, at lunch, when leaving work, when going for chocolate runs, you name it. They'll whistle at anything.  It's smokey. It smells like a BBQ all over Sydney. I just can't get over the bush-fire madness. I know, it happens every year, but I just can't get my head around it. One of my co-workers left work after lunch today to go home and keep an eye on his house....to make sure it wasn't going to be burned down. Yikes. Just can't imagine that. I guess I've taken little Springfield for granted. We do snow. And we had a hurricane once, but no bush fires.  The childhood debate is over. I was chatting to a friend about childhood crushes and I was laughing thinking about the diary I kept when I was 7. (Yes, I know, what kind of 7 year old keeps a diary? A nerdy one, that's what. ) Anyhoo, I'd write my  deepest  thoughts and concerns, which mostly dealt with things like, "Dear Diary, please help me, I don't know what to do. Who should I marry? Jon Bon Jovi or Michael Jackson?"  My friend thought about this for a moment and said, "Well, the good news is, you wouldn't have to think twice about your decision about that now!" Hahahahahaha. Jon Bon Jovi has been guest-starring on Ally McBeal here and I've been totally pining away from the comfort of my couch. His character is the perfect guy (i.e. the guy who would never like me) who's cute, musical, laid-back, go-with-the flow, sweet, reasonable, romantic, smart, funny, and he knows the answers to all of Ally's problems. That's saying a lot because Ally has a  lot  of problems. Then I find myself getting upset that his character would ever fall for such a nut-job like her. I know, it's only television, but I have had more time to think about this now that  24  is over. :(   I saw Harry Potter the other day. Loved it. I loved it even though it can't even come close to competing with the book. Not even  close . I had to refrain from holding my hands up in the air every time they changed something stupid, but I was still happy I went to see it. It was bizarre hearing all the boys voices changing! And yes, I too am a dirty old woman just like this  urlLink cool chick  for thinking that the actor playing Oliver Wood is adorable. Too bad he's only 19. Though, again, I say, is it that bad if I look about 14? ;-)  Going to see Jon Spencer Blues Explosion tonight at the Metro. Woo-hoo.  Going to Homebake on Saturday with the lovely Claudine and maybe Dave if his slack-ass ever buys a ticket! :-D  Going to try to catch up with Adrian, Josh, and Dave this weekend, if all goes to plan!  Huge congratulations to Reece's Pieces on her amazing start to her Seattle AP gig! Mum is so proud of you! ;-)

        Holidays Bizarro  and  I Think I'm Alone Now   So, I just have to say, it never feels like Christmas in Sydney. When I walk down the street in my tank top and shorts and see Christmas trees and sleighs and random reindeer signs and Santas, I feel like it's some warped joke. No offense, but it's kinda creepy. Don't get me wrong. I don't miss the freezing weather or the snow and shovelling and ice and all that, but I guess I need that stuff to get in a Christmas mood. And snow and icicles are nice to look at when you're safe and warm inside your centrally heated home, with a hot mug of cocoa and marshmallows.  But then some bastard opens the back door and you feel that freezing draft and the momen is ruined, well, you know. ;-)  I would really really like to be going home for Christmas this year - after my Thanksgiving talk to my relatives, I'm missing them more now. Unfortunately I didn't find out until too late that my office is actually shutting down for two weeks, so technically I have enough time to jaunt home for Xmas. However, the chances of finding any flights that  a) exist and b) won't set me back in debt for the rest of my life - are pretty miniscule.  Christmas in Oz has never been a very big deal because hey, it's warm and we can go to the beach, and I don't feel like I'm missing Christmas as much, because it doesn't actually FEEL like Christmas. I've always been lucky enough to have some 'orphaned' friends to spend it with. (i.e. friends who have no family in the country/state/Sydney.)  But this year all my orphaned pals are going home to the U.K. or the U.S. or Melbourne or Brisbane, or anywhere but Sydney, so yes, this will be the first Christmas I've ever spent alone. Weird!  I would love to take a little holiday somewhere, because a)   I could use a holiday and b) it would make me feel slightly less pathetic about spending Xmas alone.  I guess it's a matter of being able to find un-booked flights that won't break my bank. If all else fails, I'm going to go to the beach and torture celebrating families with my albino white skin.  ;-)  I'm having dinner now (butternut pumpkin soup with roasted capsicum - yum - okay, okay, I can hear my family/yankee pals gagging, but it's really good!) to prepare myself for the night of dancing that lies ahead.   We're going dancing at Caeser's which is this 'mixed' club that is friendly to everyone - straight/gay/whatever. On the one hand, it's nice to know that I can dance as much as I want and not one guy in the place will try to grab my butt, however, going to the ladies' room is always an adventure. I don't know if I blogged about this before, but last time I went, I got hit on every time I went to the loo.   My funniest trip to the bathroom had to be when I came out of the stall to wash my hands and there were a couple of fairly butch women blocking the hand dryer. I politely said, "Hi, um, excuse me, but could I please get to the hand dryer?"  The biggest and butchest one looked me up and down, smiled and winked, and said, "Sure thing, sweetheart." Then she slammed her elbow into the dryer to turn it on for me. I jumped - I mean, that HAD to hurt. But she just grinned at me and said, "Yeah, they call me the Fonz!"  Hahahahahahahahahahahaha!   I Think I'm Alone Now   Thank GOD!   I've had guests at my place (Butterfly Backpackers) for about the last 6 weeks. And now they're all gone! Yippeeeeeeeee! It's not that I didn't enjoy having people visit, but it is so nice to have my pad all to myself again. Last weekend was especially crazy. I had Lisa, Tim, and Josh crashing at my place. Just a tad insane!  So, rewind to last weekend. I spent Friday dancing at this place that Chad was DJ-ing at. Okay, Claudine is going to kill me, but I just have to tell this story, cause it still cracks me up. I got an e-mail from Claudine saying Chad was DJing at Starbucks on Friday. I was like, "Huh. Wow. For real? Like, as in THE Starbucks? As in' Dr.-Evil's-Secret-Lair-Can-You-Pass-Me-A-Frappuccino'  Starbucks?" I tried to imagine us drinking Frappuccinos and Mochaccinos and huge lattes, while getting our groove on on the dancefloor. Claudine wrote back and was like, "ooops, I meant Star Bar!"  I was mildly disappointed. (Just kidding!)  Anyway, Lisa and I went dancing at Star Bar with Claud and her pals while Chad was Mr. DJ - it was a fun night and we met some interesting people that night.   Saturday was, of course, Homebake. It was madness. My phone was useless most of the day and I couldn't get in touch with Claudine until like 5pm. I kept randomly running into friends and then hanging with them and then losing them again. With 25,000 people, it's not difficult to lose people. Except people you  want  to lose. I found myself a Homebake stalker - some 40-something guy who kept finding me at different venues. What a tool! 25,000 people and this bastard manages to find me. I kept telling him about how I was supposed to catch up with my 'big beefy strong muscular (albeit non-existent) boyfriend but I think he was onto me. Or just didn't care.   But I did catch up with Miss Claud and Ben and it was so good to see them! We ran into Matt on the street after Homebake - how random! - and he invited us to go dancing, but our feet/backs were pissed off at us for standing/dancing for 12 hours! Plus, I had shoeprints on my legs from where people had stepped on me during the all-day/night music festival. Miraculously I had no bruises, just shoeprints! I know I'm little, but I take up matter and space too, people! ;-)  Anyhoo, the evening ended with deep conversations at Hyde Park until the wee hours of the morning.   Sunday we went out to celebrate Josh and Evan's birthdays. I was so tired I was just walking in slow motion.   Was up until 5.30am Fri and Sat night, and I guess I'm OLD because my body now HATES me when I do this, when it used to just be mildly disapproving. ;-)  Anyhoo, enough babbling - guess I better find an outfit to dance in. I mean, I meet see The Fonz, after all. Hahahahaha!

        Thank you Mum & Dad!  and  I'm Going West for X-mas     My parents are good Santas   First of all HUGE thanks to my Mom and Dad for their lovely X-mas package that I received today. It took all my willpower not to rip open all the little goodies inside. I just chose one...which happened to be The Lord of the Rings special extended DVD edition for Fellowship of the Rings - YAY! So excited! I've been wanting this so bad! Can't wait to watch it! I've been totally PMS-ing today and feeling really tired, yucky, and a bit down, so this Christmas package came just in time. I am going to try to wait to open up the other gifts, but we'll see how long it lasts!  Thanks, you guys! Mwah!   Going out West   I've decided that I like being poor, I like eating two-minute noodles, and money is overrated. What good is having $ if you don't enjoy it, right? So I found a good deal to go somewhere I've been wanting to go for AGES, so I'm going to Perth/Western Australia for Christmas. Yay again. I am so excited. Again! I figure if I'm going to be alone for Christmas, I might as well be on holiday, right? I've got several friends from Perth who've been giving me great tips, but if you have any more recommendations for me, I'd love to hear them.  urlLink Email me!  Any tours, hostels, places to go, things to do - I wanna hear it. As it is, I think I'm going to to run out of time very quickly. There are so many things that sound wonderful. I'm definitely going to do some sort of Southwest tour and hit Margaret River etc. I'm so thrilled to be finally getting to WA - should be a lot of fun. I'm going to miss being with my family this year, but Perth should be a blast!  Lots to say, but it'll have to wait till tomorrow, I'm zonked!  Big big thanks to the lovely Claudine for sending me a box of lollies at work! I always said she was the sweetest gal - I was right! ;-) I asked to see some of her graphic design work and not only did she send me funky cool box she designed, she sent me the lollies that went in them! How cool is that?   Special thanks to Brian and Dhruv for not giving up on me even though I'm so terrible at keeping in touch. And big hugs to Javier for sending me that last email. :-D

        Merry Belated Christmas, Happy Boxing Day,  and Boy is Perth a Small World After All   Hope y'all had a good Christmas. Even though I  was disappointed about not getting to go home to Springfield for Xmas this year, it's probably just as well. They're supposed to get like  12 inches of snow and when I  chatted to my  parents and my mum's side of the family last night, they were just going to drop the pressies  off at the other  side of the family's shindig and  get the hell home  before the storm  totally set in, so I wouldn't have really seen like half my family on  xmas. And my  poor dad had a stomach flu right before xmas, which I surely would have caught. Plus, friends have told me that the weather in Sydney's been crapola since I left, so I  am ever so happy with  my  decision to come to Perth.  The weather in Perth rocks. It's very hot,  but better than the weird  warm/cold/warm/cold weather  in Syd lately. I've been taking it easy to far. I arrived her on Christmas Eve evening and met up with my friend Josh at the Globe. He text messaged me to ask if I was there yet and I messaged him to say I was in the back. 2 secs later I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turn around and it's Drew from  Karnivool, whom I met over a year ago in Tasmania at the  National Campus Band Competition.    And  if that wasn't enough to prove that Perth isn't that big, it turns out I had already  reviewed two of the three bands performing that night, at past National Campus Band Comp finals, El Horizonte, and  Heavy Weight Champ.   Do-do-do-do. It's a small  world after all, it's a small world after all, it's a small  small  world! :-)   So I hung out with Josh for a while, the went home to my hostel which is  very conveniently located in the city.  Yesterday, on Christmas Day, I went to the beach. I  went to  Cottesloe, which is absolutely beautiful. It reminded me a tiny bit of Sitges,  outside Barcelona. It was  much smaller, but very cute. The water was gorgeous and I was happy to be swimming in the Indian Ocean for the first time. Despite my  re-application of sunscreen THREE  times,   (before I got to the beach, once I got to the beach, and then  right after I got out of the water,) I stil got a  minor sunburn.  Nothing major, but I've got   some colour now on my  albino white boobage area.  Either the sun is so strong, it just laughed at my  3x application of SPF 30, or my albino  white boobs which have hardly ever  seen the light of  day  in 25 years just  couldn't take it.    So, it's not a big deal, but I was annoyed cause I was so sure that area  was safe. I'm happy to report that my back is still white as ever even though I had to apply the sunscreen to my back all by myself and the whole area is exposed to the sun. Go  contortionist Lori!  So I stayed yesterday at the beach until the sun set and I photographed that -  I had slight flashbacks  to the time I thought I was going to die after  photographing the  sunset at East Point, outside Darwin  (Northern Territory)  and was trying to  find my way back  in pitch  blackness. Lucky  I knew my way back to Cottesloe  train station!  Today I took it easy and just did the Swan River  Cruise thing, which was nice and relaxing. I tried  and tried to book a tour for today, but nobody was open yesterday to take bookings - just as well, I've been so tired,  the cruise was  just what I needed. I took pics of the awesome townhouses I would like to live in if I ever moved to Perth. ;-)  Or maybe they could be my parents'  retirement home.  They keep  talking about retiring  in  Oz and Perth is  safely  far enough away from Sydney....just kidding, guys :-)  Tomorrow I'm doing a 'Pinnacles  at  Sunset' tour. They pick you up at  noon, and you stop  and see/do a bunch of cool stuff before  arriving in the  desert at sunset  to see the Pinnacles (these alienish looking   rock formations in the middle of the desert). Then  we  dine on freshly caught fish  (yum)  and camp out overnight in sleeping bags under the stars. I've never  camped out before EVER  so I'm looking forward to it!   In the morning, we go swimming at a  beach and then we go  sandsurfing  and  catch breakfast before heading back to Perth  by  noon on Sat. Saturday  arvo I plan to go to Freemantle and Subiaco.  Sunday I'm  going to do a Southwest tour including Margaret River and Mandurah.  Then   on Monday, my last (sob)  day here, I'm doing an Eco-boat tour of  Rottnest Island , which includes fishing, snorkeling, seeing those   cute little quokkas, and hopefully (fingers crossed!)  ,  seeing some dolphins!  Please, Flipper, come to Lori! :-)  p.s. Thanks to my work Secret Santa, I've read the most hilarious book in ages -  Stupid White Men  by Michael Moore. EVERYONE should read this! It is so fricking funny and it almost makes me want to hop on the next plane back to the U.S.A. to try to save America from itself .(My parents will like hearing this!) It is funny and inspirational and surprising and jaw-dropping. LOVE IT! Amazing job, once again, Mr. Moore!

        Is this a bad sign, Roy?   Lordy...I kept putting off booking my hostel in Perth because my lovely friends, who I know are only trying to help me, were making me paranoid (Jamie!) by telling me to avoid this one dodgy area of town in particular. I kept studying my map, trying to judge if different hostels I liked seemed far enough away from the designated dodgy area, etc. Anyway, I knew it was bad to put it off because this is a hugely busy time of year for hostels in Perth and I was taking a chance by waiting so long...but after listening to me naming street names that I thought were far away enough from the 'dodge-zone', Josh took pity on me and asked some friends who were in town where they were staying and it was some very centrally located hostel right smack dab in the centre of Perth. It's a place I would have booked first, had it been available to book online. I am sadly becoming one of those people who will go out of their way to not have to make contact with human beings.  I LOVE making reservations online. I can do it any time I like and not have to listen to people scolding me for booking at the last minute. ;-)  I desperately attempted to book this place online, but alas, their 'booking forms' (and I'm rolling with laughter at calling it that) and their 'contact us' forms (giggle giggle) aren't actually linked up to anything and are a big waste of time. I had to (sigh) call Perth and talk to a human being.   Me: Hi, I was wondering if you had any dorm rooms available starting from tomorrow evening... Elderly Man Behind the Hostel Counter in a Small Town: You're going to have to speak up! I can barely hear you!  Me: I wanted to know if you had any dorms free from tomorrow night? Him: Sure, what's your name? Me: Lori. Him: Sorry? Me: Lori. Lorrrrri. Him: Roy? Me: No, not Roy. LORI. L - O - R - I Him: Right, Roy. Me: No, L as in Linda. O as in Oscar. R as in Rose. And, and I as in, um, Island. Him: R-O-Y. Roy? Me: No, no, I'm not a boy. It's L-O-R-I.  (sidebar: I probably should have just said Lorraine. I HATE the name Lorraine and Lori is not short for Lorraine, I'm just Lori, but I've had heaps of people insist on calling me Lorraine. Whatever, I don't really care about Lorraine at the end of the day, but I'm sorry, I draw the line at Roy!) Me: (insert many spelling attempts here...10 minutes later....) Him: L-O-R-I? Jesus f*cking Christ. How the hell do you say that? Me: Lori, rhymes with story. Him: What the hell kinda name is that?  Me: It's just a name. A girl's name.  Him: Right....  And it went from there. I have a booking. But I bet you anything I'm down there as Roy....the hardest part was that I was trying so hard not to laugh my ass off the whole time...too funny!  So we just found out today that we're doing Secret Santa at work...will I get a butterfly sticker? Only time will tell. We're working half a day tomorrow, then doing an office lunch, then I'm off to see Perth and parts of Western Australia, hopefully as Lori, and not Roy. ;-)  So much to see and do - I am SO looking forward to it!  (pssst, Mom and Dad, send me an email and let me know when I should call you guys on Christmas!)  Merry Christmas everyone! Feliz Navidad!

        Music, Dancing, Good Food, and Good Deads   This pretty much sums up my weekend. I went to see Gerling @ The Annandale on Saturday, with Claudine, Nigel, Todd, and Brooke - it was EXCELLENT. I was a good little girl and wore my ear plugs, so it was great and I wasn't deaf like everyone else afterwards. After that, we jetted over to Fox Studios to catch the last hour of Chad's DJ-ing - it was a cute dance floor and it was good fun dancing along to Chad's picks for grooves. Go DJ, Go DJ! ;-) After  that  we were starving so we drove to Coogee to grab some yummy pizza while Chad played DJ in the car.  Great night indeed, and Claud ever so nicely drove me home - yay!   Tonight I was supposed to go see Andrew's band, Quarter Acre, play at the Hollywood Hotel. I promised him I'd be there and I  really  wanted to go, except that about an hour and a half before I needed to leave, I was laying on my bed, in the fetal position, praying for the cramps to stop, and waiting for 4 panadeines to kick in. I know, I know, this is all WAY too much information, but I swear, Andrew's gigs are all freakishly on par with my errr, 'female  cycle' - what the hell??? I was going to suggest to him that his change the name of his band to '28 Days' - but that's already been taken. ;-) I have missed at least two gigs in the past because I started my freaking period like right before his show, and I just couldn't get up out of bed, so when it happened tonight, I was like, "WHY? WHYYYY?"  But I was determined. Besides, I'd already used the PMS excuse too many times before - even though it was actually true! Anyhoo, no one's probably even reading this blog entry anymore as I've turned everyone off by discussing my cramps, but whatever. I'm glad I sucked it up as Quarter Acre put on an excellent show and I got to catch up with my friend Angela's sister Lucy, who is really sweet and told me all about her trip to South America (so jealous!) .  Andrew was his usual hilarious self and we went out to dinner afterwards to this yummy Korean restaurant in the city. The food was fantastic and it's hilarious to see people's jaws drop open when they hear this red-haired white little aussie guy speak some good Korean! Hehe.   On our way to the restaurant, however, we came across a water tap that was beyond busted and basically, a 'river' was flowing down Campbell Street. Some of you may not know, but we're experiencing a major drought in New South Wales, so all this water being wasted was extra bad  due to the current situation. What to do? We wanted to call Sydney Water, but didn't know the number and both of us were out of credit on our phones, so we walked to the nearest police station and reported the busted pipe and the raging river flowing down Campbell Street. The cops looked at us like we were on crack for a moment, but when they realised we were completely sober and just wanting someone to fix the water leak, they were like, "Cool, thanks, guys!"  After our yummy dinner, we went back to check, and sure enough, the pipe had been fixed! So that was our good deed for the evening.   I'm so excited about my trip to Perth that I actually started packing  yesterday , on Saturday. I never pack until the morning of a trip, pretty much, so you can tell I am more than enthusiastic. Big thanks to Jamie, Adam, and Lisa for their recent Perth tips!

        urlLink    Why My Body Went on Strike   A Perth Holiday Adventure, by B-Fly  Okay, so remember when I was whinging about being too sore and in pain to actually move and didn't want to go out on New Year's Eve, yadda yadda yadda? Well here's why. As mentioned in previous blogs, I had gone sand-surfing/sledding last Saturday morning. Climbing up the huge sand dunes was just a primer. That's where my legs got a bit sore. This story is about how they got  really  sore. What I like about this story is that, for once, it has nothing to do with me being in really bad shape. It was just a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, being told the wrong thing but a complete tool. You know, that sort of thing....I feel like Sophia from the Golden Girls...."Imagine this....Sicily, 1942...."  Imagine this....Perth, Western Australia, Monday morning, December 30th, 2002. 5.30am. I'm supposed to be on a tour to Carnac and Rottnest Islands. I haul my tired ass out of my bunk bed to go take a shower in the Funk Motel (more about that later). The last thing I want to do is put on my bikini before 6am in the bleeping morning. Surely I can just get dressed and put my bathing suit on before we get to the first island,  right?  I won't be the only dork who doesn't have their bathing suit on at 6am, right?  7am. On the boat in Freemantle. At this moment in time, I am the only English speaking tourist in the boat. This is a first, and I have to say, it was pretty interesting to be in the minority, for once (more about this later too!) Everyone else on the tour only speaks Japanese. Thankfully we have a Japanese guide. She is nice. We also have Mr. Tool. I don't remember his real name, but he is the ass who is piloting the godforsaken boat. "Does everyone have their bathing suits on?" (Followed by translation in Japanese.) Everyone nods. DOH! I'm the only loser who doesn't have the bathing suit on underneath my clothes currently. Tool gives me a LOOK and tells me to go put my bathing suit on in the bathroom while we make our way to Carnac Island. Fine. Personally, I think it's a little too early for someone to have his bad attitude, but whatever.   So, I grab my bikini and make my way to the loo. I get inside and lock the door. This is definitely the smallest bathroom I've ever been in. It's just a stall, with a tiny sink and a toilet. No worries, I just need to put on my bikini and it's smooth sailing...um, not quite...I'm trying to get my bikini bottom on, but I keep falling over. There's absolutely nothing to hold on to. No bar, nothing. The best I can do is kinda cling to the sink to steady myself. The boat is swaying from side to side. Hard. Then the boat starts bobbing up and down. Very very hard. Ba-BOOM. Ba-BOOM. We start going faster and faster. This only increases the violent smacks of the boat on the water. Forget the freaking bathing suit, I'm worried about not getting hurt. We go even faster...what the hell is this idiot doing? We're in rough waters and we're in a pretty small boat. Is going faster really the answer? BOOM! BOOM! Water starts falling in from the ceiling, so I'm now soaked. BOOM! BA-BOOM! I start to hear screaming. What the bleepin' bleep is going on out there????  BOOM! BOOM! KA-BOOM! I stand low, bracing myself. I'm standing as low as I can (my Tai Chi teacher would be so proud), so I can keep my balance. BOOM! Crap....every time we go BOOM, my poor little body slams into the toilet, the sink, the wall. My ass and my back and my tailbone are the biggest targets. OW! OW! OW! I feel like a little ragdoll. And I'm going to be one freaking brusied little ragdoll. I start yelling, for no apparent reason, as no one can hear me. So, I'm standing there, like an idiot, with my bikini bottoms kinda on, kinda not on, my tank top on, and my bag of clothes around my wrist, clinging onto the sink and standing as low as I can, trying to avoid getting my ass/tailbone/back slammed into the toilet/wall, but I'm very unsuccessful. BOOM! KA-BOOM! Body slam! More water pours in from up above....I hear more people screaming. Are we taking in water? What is going  on ???  How the hell am I going to get out of here? I can't let go of the sink long enough to unlock the door and open it. If I open it, that means I won't be holding on to anything, and I'll be going flying into the stairs of the boat, probably head first, with my luck. But if I stay put, I'll keep getting battered by the toilet/wakll and I might hit my head or something, and if I'm knocked out, no one's going to come to get me, as I'm locked in from the inside....I focus on the strong desire to get out of here and smack Tool around the face.   20 minutes later, I manage to let go long enough to get the hell out of there. I, of course, fall into the stairs, stagger up them, and clumsily make my way to a spot to sit down. Everyone is clinging to their seats, most people are looking  fairly green. I shoot death stares at Tool, but he is oblivious. While I am pissed off at this idiot for telling me to go into the damn bathroom in these horrible boating conditions, I am damn pleased to be alive, conscious, and not bleeding. Meanwhile, I still have to get my bikini top on, and I sure as hell am not going back down there. So, I somehow get my bikini top on in full view of the other passengers, with only my tank top to block me. I so don't give a damn, it's not even funny.   I don't get mad very often, but when I do, watch out. My dream at this point is to punch Tool in the face repeatedly and then lock him up in the bathroom while I drive the boat, hitting every bad wave at every bad angle. MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. But I take deep breaths and decide to chill out. The freakin' 'tour' hasn't even started yet and I'm not going to let this bastard ruin my day. Plus, there's no way for me to be calm about this....if I talk to him about it now, I'm going to have to use some, well...not very nice words and it's gonna be a LONG day. So, I settle down, focus on all the beautiful things we're going to see that day, and mentally store all my expletives for a nice long letter I'm going to write to him when I get back to Sydney.  So, I experience the rest of the stomach-lurching ride from up above. At least the seats are padded here. More screams, a young girl tries to stand up for a second and flies across to the other side of the boat, the mother freaks out. I've never EVER had motion sickness in my life and I've been on my fair share of rough boat rides, but even my stomach is not the happiest. Meanwhile, Tool is still obvlious. He's got some fancy schmancy souped-up chair and a seatbelt and not a care in the world. He couldn't care less about kids and tourguides flying to the other sides of the boat or nearly falling out of the boat. That rat bastard!  Anyhoo, we get to slighly less choppy waters and this 12 year old-ish looking girl needs to use the loo. I try to stop her. "NO! Don't go! It's not safe! Please, wait till we get there." She just smiles at me and staggers away....of course she has no idea what I'm saying. I yell at one of the guides to translate to her and she just tells the girl to be careful. 15 minutes later, the girl staggers back out, looking absolutely traumatised. And these are better waters than before. The poor thing is pale and sickly looking and she has a lone tear running down her face. I want to hug her and tell her that I know what it's like.   Anyway, that's why I was in so sore. That is why I couldn't move on New Year's Eve.  Trust me, if you did a really tense deep knee bend for a half an hour while getting beaten up by a toilet, you'd be a bit sore too. ;-) So, it wasn't SandMaster, it was, "Trying To Stay Upright, Conscious, and Un-Slammable in the Loo."  Most hardcore workout of my life. ;-) Anyhoo, the point is, despite me being hurt and sunburn and sore and all, I had a fabulous time in Western Australia...I've fully recovered from the soreness, and the bruises on my ass/back are healing nicely, but I'm still working on the random sunburn....my left leg looks like I have the Mich.ael Jac.kson skin disorder. And I still have the one damn ring of sunburn on my left thigh. Totally looks like a garter belt. A gater belt of sunburn. It was all worth it though - WA is a gorgeous place - I would recommend to all of you...just remember never to go the bathroom on a moving boat, and make sure you get a full wetsuit (and not a half one like me) so your sunscreen doesn't come off randomly while you're snorkelling so you don't get the oddest sunburn designs on your legs! ;-)

        Christmas in Western Australia/New Year's in Sydney  urlLink Slideshow/Photogallery      A New Year's Tale    It's New Year's down at Rushcutter's Bay, Sydney. Perfect view of the Harbour Bridge, and LORI takes a pic of the gang. BEN offers to take a photo so LORI can be in it, but then a RANDOM MAN offers to take a photo. The gang poses, then they get ready to watch fireworks and toast with champagne..    CROWD:  10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...Happy New Year!  GANG:  Cheers, everyone! (clinking glasses)  C.J.:  Okay, who wants some love? Who wants a hug? (C.J. proceeds to hug Dave, Stu, Lori, Emma, Ben, etc)   RANDOM MAN:  I'd like some love - you got any champagne to spare?  STU:  Sure, you did take our picture and all....(STU gives RANDOM MAN and RANDOM MAN'S WIFE some champagne)  RANDOM MAN:  Thanks very much! Cheers!   Later on...    LORI  (to gang) : The fireworks kicked ass once again!  RANDOM MAN:  Yeah, those fireworks were absolutely amazing.  LORI:  (noticing accent) Hey, where are you from?  RANDOM MAN:  We're from Canada. We're Canadian.  LORI:  (raising glass) Well, Happy New Year, fellow North Americans! Whereabouts in Canada are you from?  RANDON MAN:  Vagina. We're from Vagina.   (long shocked awkward silence)    LORI exits the 'stage', laughing her ass off. EMMA looks puzzled and turns to BEN who is laughing at LORI laughing and shaking.     STU:  (confused) Um, did he say what I think he said?  EMMA:  What's going on? Where are they from?  BEN:  They're from Vagina!  EMMA:   WHAT????   LORI:  (walking back towards the gang, still laughing) Well, technically, we're  all  from there, if you think about it....  C.J.:  That is fantastic! I'm going to have to use that. That's where I'm telling people I'm from from now on. I'm from Vagina.   EMMA:  Is he for real?  LORI:  I don't know, but you can bet I'm going to look that up on the internet tomorrow...actually, forget that, I'm looking that up as soon as I get home!  STU:  Is he really serious? Or just drunk? Did he really say that?  LORI:  I just let a man from Vagina use my digital camera. Damn!  C.J.:  (to RANDOM MAN'S WIFE) So, whereabouts in Canada are you from again?   RANDOM MAN'S WIFE:  Vagina. Vagina, Saskatchewan.  C.J.:  Right, thanks.  STU:  Unreal...   LORI starts shaking with laughter again, exiting stage. Tears are streaming down her face.    STU:  What a night. Good party, good fireworks, good champagne, and we've met someone from Vagina!    Ten minutes later, after much thinking about pens, T-shirts, postcards and other souvenirs saying, "Welcome to Vagina.."     LORI:  Ohhh, I just had a flashback from elementary school.  Crap, I think they must have said RUH-JIE-NUH, not VUH-JIE-NUH...I remember the teacher telling us that the capital of Saskatchewan was Regina, but she pronounced it RUH-GEE-NUH. Either she just told us the wrong way of saying it, because she didn't know any better, or she knew better than to tell us RUH-JIE-NUH because she knew we'd  have a slew of VUH-JIE-NUH jokes.   STU:  (sad) So, it's Regina, not Vagina?   LORI:  I know....I'm disappointed too. Oh well - we can always neglect to tell people this part of the story....and let them believe in Vagina...    FADE OUT.     THE END    Okay, how immature am I? I'm 25 years old and this occurred over 3 days ago and I'm still cracking up as if it was happening the first time!  Why did I have to remember my Canadian Province capitals and ruin it for everyone? (See, I know it's hard to believe, but Americans do actually have to learn capitals of things outside of America occasionally!) We're too old for Santa and the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy, but for 15 minutes, we had... urlLink Vagina ....

        urlLink    Happy New Year, Part II   Check out my  urlLink photogallery/slideshow  for my Christmas in Perth/Western Oz and New Years in Sydney. You can wait for the slideshow, or if you're in a hurry, just click on the little thumbnail on the side to view the pic you want.  I've got three things to thank for getting me out on NYE...The first was  urlLink Fidelma's  'tough-love' SMS telling me my lame 'oh, but my body hurts' excuse wasn't good enough.  This message helped, but still wasn't enough to get my ass out of bed. I had a headache, I was tired, and I was laying there, tenderly massaging my legs, trying to convince myself it wouldn't be too sad if I just stayed home on New Year's Eve to watch my Lord of the Rings DVD. I mean, I had chips, I had dip, I had cheese & crackers. I could even put on a sparkly top if I needed to.   Then Claudine called. I told her I couldn't move. I explained that movement of any kind produced hardcore swearing that would make most people blush. She was like, "Okay, I'm picking you up. We'll be at your place at 9.30pm. You're coming."  I couldn't argue with a ride. A ride would mean I wouldn't have to walk to/from a bus stop. A ride would mean a lot less cursing. So I whipped out Panadeine for the headache the Nurofen Gel I'd bought at the chemist and massaged it onto my pathetic legs/back. That is the BEST stuff ever! Within a half hour, I could stand up and sit down without swearing. That rocked!  I got myself into the shower, got dressed, put my party food into a bag, and was ready to go when Claud, Emma, and Ben arrived. I am very lucky to have good friends who know when not to take my crap. :-) Thanks, guys!   urlLink   Chris was very kind to offer his pad up as the party place, Amanda kept the yummy pitcher flowing, Chad was a great DJ, and Fidelma delighted us all to her thesis on "Why Avril Lavigne is Evil" while managing to lip-sync perfectlyto her songs. (Oh and HUGE congrats to two super people who were not able to come to the party, but who certainly have something amazing to celebrate - I don't want to name names until that everyone who's supposed to know has heard it from them first!) So, the party was very good, talked to some very  funny people....and in spite of my last blog, we went and saw some fireworks! Hehe! In my defense, I would not have wanted to go and stand for hours waiting, but then C.J. decided at 11.40pm that we should go watch the fireworks at Rushcutters Bay. It was only a 15 minute walk and my Nurofen Gel was still working (yay!), so we went and we had a fantastic view and it wasn't obscenely crowded, so it was a wonderful idea. As usual, Sydney knows how to do fireworks so well.  We also met a very entertaining Canadian couple while watching the fireworks - I don't know if I can type up the story now as I might pull a muscle in my stomach from laughing too hard and the last thing I need right now is another pulled muscle... ;-)

        Happy New Year from Sydney!    So, I got back to Sydney from Perth this morning at 6.30am. And what am I doing right now? Well, it's about 6.30pm on New Year's Eve and I'm laying on my bed in my nightgown, hoping for the best. I am in pain and hoping for the humiliation to stop. I am in the worst physical condition of anyone I know - it's pathetic! It took me nearly 20 minutes to walk to Broadway this arvo (normally takes me about 3). I was on a mission to buy that cream old people use on their aches and pains...I was on the phone with my parents earlier and I was like, "What's that cream older people use? That gay cream?" They started laughing - 'Um, BenGay, Lori..." "Yeah, that's it!"  I don't know if they have BenGay here...no doubt they have Gay Bens, but that's Sydney for ya. ;-). So I just bought this odor-less gel (so I won't have to smell like an elderly person, no offence to elderly people) that targets aching muscles/pain. I hope it works...right now I swear like a drunken sailor any time I need to sit down, stand up, move, etc. I don't know what I was expecting. You can't be a lazy ass all your life and then expect your muscles not to fight back when you suddenly decide to use them!  I have pulled every leg muscle from the knee up and I am sunburned on my left left, from the knee down. OW.  The pain got its foundation from sandsurfing/sledding in a little town called Lancelin in Western Australia (the actually sledding DOWN part was aweseome - it was climbing up that was a bitch!) Imagine climbing the steepest hill you can think of, only it's all made out of sand, so you just keep sinking back down. Best workout ever - forget stair master - SAND MASTER! So Sandmaster was the beginning of the pain, but it's what I experienced yesterday en route to Rottnest Island that enabled me to take my original pain to an all new level! It was also on this Rottnest adventure I got random bits of sunburn on my left calve, my left thigh, and my right hand/wrist. I'd forgotten how painful sunburn is.   I am too tired to tell the story now, so hopefully tomorrow, but boy was it an adventure I've never had before. I have lots of stories from Perth/WA, which I'll probably split up and re-cap over this week. In the meantime, I'm trying to get myself fit for going out tonight. I have 4 options, one of which I've already vetoed. There's no way in hell I can stand around for fireworks tonight. I adore Sydney's fireworks, but I have to live with my legs all year and they will not be standing for this tonight - literally. ;-) There are three little shindigs which sound promising, my only problem is actually motivating myself to get to one of them. I don't want to go out. I don't want to move. I just want to lie in a tub of ice and aloe. Is that so wrong?  Anyway, please ignore all my stupid whinging - I am well aware that a very sore and sunburned body is not a big deal and the main thing is that I had a wonderful time in Western Australia and met lots of cool/funny people. I would totally go back there to do the things I missed out on this time.   Okay, back to my aloe time....

        Happy Bizarre Anniversary To Me   Today is the 16th Anniversary of the day I broke my arm due to being forced into a game of tag against my will and running into a door.   I was 9.   The game of tag was the idea of an Evil Girl from Springfield. If I've ever had an actual 'nemesis' - this was the girl. It's okay though because my soon-to-be finished novel based on her will be a big hit and then it's only a matter of time before it's turned into a movie and everyone will get to see this little nightmare in action. Of course, I will donate a large portion of the novel/movie earnings to a worthy children's charity. ;-)  Here's to 16 years of me being a relatively accurate meteorologist - I can feel the rain in my bones! Hehe - 'accurate meteorologist' - that's the funniest oxymoron I've used in ages! :D

        Lord of the Rings, Lady of the Moths   I took it easy and had a very quiet weekend. Went to the movies on sat. Finally saw  Lord of the Rings (Two Towers)   with my one friend who hadn't seen it yet. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me, but I attract moths wherever I go. It must have something to do with my apartment.   I had a moth problem eons ago when Kristen was staying with me, and then they disappeared after she left. Maybe they figured she was the fun one and decided the party was over. But then I had my balcony doors open at night a couple months ago and a couple moths flew in, attracted to the light, I guess - and they've decided to mate and settle their colony into my apartment. :(  Let me tell you something...Moths mate like rabbits! I have no idea where they're mating - all I know is that no matter how many I kill, more turn up! I've got moth balls on top of my kitchen cupboards (I just love that old-lady's house moth ball smell!) and I've got lavendar clothes protector thingies in my closets and I've got 'moth traps' which have this moth pheremone in them to attract them and moths land and get stuck to it.   And now, EVERYwhere I go, moths find me. Including the movie theatres. For THREE hours, this freaking moth kept flying in my face during  Lord of the Rings  - the people behind me must have thought I was nuts, the way I kept flapping my hand in front of my face, trying to whack the moth away.  It's happened at various stores/shopping centres all over Sydney. At restaurants. You name it. My friends never believe me, until they witness it! Moths find me! I'd be in Freedom (yes, yes, the homewares department) one time and one of my friends started laughing going, "ohmygod, there's a moth flying around your head." And then we'd be at KMART and within minutes, guess what was flying around my face? Food courts, by the Harbour, at Grace Brothers, in the CBD, Chinatown, Surry Hills, even in Perth! I had moths following me around Perth! What the hell????  One friend even bought me a new set of fly/bug swatters so I have them in every room of my apartment for easy access for my sport of moth-massacre. I wouldn't care so much that they're there, if they didn't have to show off and fly around my face and head all the time.   So, my theories on why moths are stalking me are:    I smell like moth balls and I've created a mutant strain of moths that are attracted instead of repelled to it   I smell like moth pheremones (from the traps) and they think I'm a moth too and land on me in an attempt to mate with me (as if I don't have enough freaks hitting on me - must I have a whole other species cracking on to me too?)  !   The moths see all my butterfly stuff in my apartment, on my clothes, on my jewelry and assume they're welcome! ;-)    Is this bad karma for not going to see  he Mothman Prophecy   Any moth specialists out there?   I'm not sure if I've mentioned this before, but Lisa was mulling over the whole moth thing before she left Oz and was like, "It's like your life, really. You like butterflies, but you only get the moths."  Sad, but true! ;-)  My friend Abby has given me a recommendation on how to get rid of the moths - I'll report back soon...hopefully my little non-paying colony of boarders will be gone before my parents make their 2nd trip to Australia in February. The countdown is on!  And now for something random:     urlLink How old are you?   It's more effective when you're older, I guess, but still cool...I tried typing in my grandparents' and great grandparents' b-days - that really put things in perspective! Type in your birthdate Yankee style (mm/dd/yyyy)   urlLink here .

        Rain, Dammit, RAIN!   Never thought I'd actually pray for rain, but I am. I don't know if this is getting much news outside Australia, but basically the nation's capital (Canberra) is on fire. :(   The top article in the SMH online reads:   urlLink CANBERRA ABLAZE:Two dead and 400 homes lost   Unbelievable. I still can't wrap my head around the concept of worrying about my house burning down. I know Australians face bush fires every year, but I still can't imagine that being the norm. The Snowy Mountains are in trouble too - lots of people being evacuated there as well. So I'm praying for rain.  I really should get my little grandmother in Springfield on the case. She prays more than anyone I know. ;-) (Hey Mom, tell Babci to pray for Canberra, okay? ;-)  I'm extra nervous because I was on the phone with a pal from Canberra yesterday and then the lines went dead. His house was in major danger and I figured it was the fires that cut our conversation short. He then managed to call me back from somewhere else and said they were all being evacuated and then the lines went dead again. :(  It must just be the most helpless feeling ever, for both the homeowners and the firemen. :(   Growing up in Springfield Massachusetts in the U.S., we were pretty lucky. We don't have any annual natural disasters like that.  I remember that hurricane we had when I was a kid, but other than that we just get blizzards and those are annoying but don't take people's houses down.  I guess it's like people who live in Florida or North Carolina who are in hurricane central, or in middle-america US who are in tornado central, or Californians who get earthquakes and fires etc.  But these fires just seem to go on for so long...it must really wear people out. It was 38 degrees (100 degrees F) in Sydney yesterday - a total oven, even in the shade. I hope it rains soon - long and hard!

        urlLink    In Oz and Wanna Win BDO Artist CDs?  Head to the Arrive alive BIG DAY OUT 10 CD PACK online  urlLink competition . You have to be 18-25 to enter, so once again, tell your 'young' friends! ;-)   Wanna See Exclusive Big Day Out 2003 Footage?  You should check out this cool  urlLink footage  - and I'm not just saying that because I've been spending all week putting up the videos on the website ;-) If you're an old-school kinda person, you'll want to see the  urlLink Retro  BDO footage.  So...sorry I've been so, I don't know, non-existent lately, both on and offline, but the Big Day Out thang has been crazy. Fun, but stressful. The Cruise to the Big Day Out Comp went really well - we got thousands of entries and lemme tell you, reading through all of them took, well, a LOT longer than I thought it would. But ringing the winners to tell them they'd won 4 tix to the sold-out Sydney BDO and a cruise to Homebush - well, geez, I felt like Santa Claus. I've decided I want a job where I can just call people up and tell them they've won something all day! I tell you, I was absolutely glowing. People screamed in delight, they thanked me profusely, (as if I had anything to do with the purchasing of the tix!) It felt good. It made up for having to read through the gazillion entries! ;-) It was funny, this one girl was in the car when I rang her to say she won. She started freaking out a la Elaine Benis on Seinfeld, going, "Oh my GOD! Get OUT! No way!" She was screaming and squealing. I said, "Um....are you driving?" She said yes and started screaming some more, telling her friends in the car they were all going to the BDO. More screaming. I said, "Um, maybe you might want to pull over?" And she said, "Oooh, yeah, you're right." Phew. Can you imagine? I cringed, imagining the possible news headline, "Sydney Gal gets into car accident due to excitement from being told she won tix to the Big Day Out from Arrive alive." Not good! ;-)   urlLink   Now, in theory, writing content for Big Day Out newsletters and some BDO band bios/histories, and putting up video footage from this year's shows and previous year's stuff, is all very cool. I do enjoy it - and if it were all I had to do, I'd enjoy it even more, but you know how it is. It's just one of many projects I've been working on at work, so every day has just been like, "CRAP! My to-do list keeps getting longer!" I worked late nearly every night this week and that's helped, but Monday already feels daunting!  Catching up...lately I've seen  urlLink Fourplay  &  urlLink Sarah Blasko  at  urlLink The Basement . They were absolutely stunning. Do not miss out on either act if you have the chance to go see 'em!  At the Big Day Out, I saw heaps of great bands/artists, including Pacifier, Jimmy Eat World, Queens of the Stone Age, PJ Harvey, Pnau, Jane's Addiction, Foo Fighters, etc. Awesome day, even though I lost all my friends by the end of the night - hee hee. Oh, and I must remember to write about the tools in the V.I.P. section at the BDO. I only ventured into the V.I.P. area after I lost my friends and figured I should give it a shot to see what it actually means to be a "V.I.P" at the BDO...apparently it means you have to act like you've got a stick up your arse. My gig rage was flaring!  I'm sure there were some very fine people there, but only the rude ones interacted with me. More about that later.  Congrats to Sydney band  urlLink The Drugs  for not only cracking the  urlLink Triple J Hottest 100 , but for coming in at a beyond-respectable No. 38 with "The Bold & the Beautiful" - I am not at all surprised!  I went to see The Vines for free at The Enmore on Wednesday with the lovely Claudine (Thanks Gav!) It was fun because a) It gave me hope that if these guys have made it big, then I have a shot in hell after all and b) I didn't pay for the gig. I did enjoy myself immensely and I am convinced that with the right audio engineer I'm going to be the 'next big thing' - watch out, Avril! (Okay, maybe not -  even the best sound person can't invent a 'range' for me, but whatever.)   Oh, and on Wednesday I encountered the funniest cabbie in ages - and you know that's saying a lot because I've had some real characters over the years - but that's not too surprising - who doesn't have a great taxi driver story (or 12) these days? I'll try to write up the story tomorrow - I've got to get back to work on my many side-projects (i.e. my NON-paying gigs!) ;-)  p.s. Happy Birthday to my lil' cousin Rob. Okay, okay, so he's like a foot taller than me, but he's still my lil' cousin, dammit! I feel so old - can't believe he's 19. If Mum & Dad or Auntie Kate could email me Rob's new number, it would be much appreciated!

        Cairns...5 years later...   So, I'm now in Cairns with my parents who are back in Australia for their 2nd visit. They were last here 3 years ago and this time around I decided to take them to Cairns as a) I thought they'd enjoy it and b) Even though I've been here before, there are plenty of things I  didn't get a chance to see and do.  What is really crazy is that I was last in Cairns  5 years ago . That makes me feel super old! Geez! And I saw my beloved Pearl Jam last night at the Entertainment Centre and I also saw them there  5 years ago . Jaysus! Time is going by scarily fast. Though apparently, even though I feel old, I do not seem to have been touched by the ageing process. Granted, anyone who knows me knows I look young for my age, but I think the fact that I've been walking around with my parents has made me look even younger. People keep thinking I'm like 16 or something. "No, I'm 25, I'm just with my parents!" No one can believe the 25 thing. I keep getting, "But you don't look a day over 17!" Hate to break it to you guys, but I'm OLD, I'm not jail bait! ;-)  Anyhoo, today was about 32 degrees in Cairns...I took a detour via Brisbane and met up with my parents in Cairns as we were on separate flights. It's just as well, we were all getting pretty annoyed with each other this morning. As usual, I was running late and was packing and desperately making lists to email to my office to tell them what needs to be done while I'm away, then I remembered I hadn't told some clients I'd be gone for a bit, so I had to email them at like 6am to let them know I'd be away. They must think I'm insane. I mean, I am, but they don't need to know that! ;-) So, get this: Lori packs all her stuff in about a half hour this morning and my parents packed all their stuff about 2 days ago. So we get to Cairns and guess what? All Lori's stuff is fine and even though my parents packed their suitcase 2 days ago, they took the wrong suitcase to the airport - hahahahahaha! Okay, so it's not really funny, but it is. It just goes to show that procrastination works sometimes! I felt bad for them though because they didn't have as many clothes as they'd intended and they both were missing bathing suits - but we went out shopping and we got bathing suits for the whole fam - really cute ones, really cheap - so hey, there you go.  The funniest Shea moment of the day: We're in our hotel (which is amazing, by the way, I'll talk about that later) and my dad goes, "Ooops!" And we're like, "What?" And he says, "Um, ooops, I just took a picture."  I ask him what the heck he took a picture of and he says, "I just took a picture of the inside of my pants pocket." Hahahahaha. He has one of those disposable cameras and he had wound up the thing so it was ready to go and accidentally touched the button, thus taking a picture of the inside of his pants. Hahahha.   So what do both the pic of the pants pocket and whole accidentally taking the wrong suitcase thing mean? Well, they mean that I am actually related to these people after all. I mean, I was laughing at them, but in a sympathetic way, as I could see myself doing the same thing.  We're a cursed family, but not in a bad way. Only in the way of unfortunate but funny things. ;-)  We're going to Kuranda tomorrow - Butterfly Sanctuary, here I come (again!) I'm going home to the Mothership! :-)

        Rainforests, Spiders, Leeches, Mosquitos, Great Barrier Reef, Snorkelling, Oh My My   Things have been awfully exciting here in Cairns. On Monday we went on a Daintree Rainforest/Cape Tribulation tour and I thought my parents would never speak to me agian. Our tour started with a cruise down the Daintree river (nope, we didn't see any crocs - it was too warm) and my parents were still speaking to me then. It was more when we entered the Rainforest and our hilarious tourguide, Jay, started talking about the disease carrying mosquitos, the spiders, and the leeches, that really got my parents feeling happy. And it rained. That  is  why they call it a rainforest, after all! ;-) It was a bit too much nature for them, but they survived! They'll be talking about this one for years. My mother almost took out a very impressive and amazing spider web (home to a huge spider) and my mother had a leech on her shoe so we all heard about that. And then my dad fell down hard while he and I were walking back to camp (we were alone at this point.) We were walking along this slipperly area and I was ahead of him and all of a sudden I hear, "BOOM" - I was scared to turn around - I thought he might have fallen over the ledge! Thank god, no, he was still on the path, but he was flat out, literally. He landed on his hip and elbow, which was bleeding a bit, but we had water, a towel, and I had some band-aids, so we cleaned him up a bit. :-) He thinks he's going to have a scar, but I think in a week you won't see a thing.  We hiked through the rainforest for about an hour and then just when we thought we'd pass out from the heat, we arrived at a beautiful waterfall and went swimming. It was aweseome.   Our tour guide was so freaking funny though - and very informative. After our great lunch, we headed back to our "Black Beast" army vehicle and couldn't get out of the rainforest as it was too muddy. People got out and helped find rocks and things to provide traction and about 40 minutes later, we were fine.   The German guy was riding shotgun up with our guide for a while but asked me to sit up front with Jay for a while. So I did and I stayed there the rest of the trip - it was fun being up front. You could see a hell of a lot more and I felt like I was royalty or something. Our guide, Jay, was a big talker, and as ex-co-workers have said, I can talk underwater, so we just chatted non-stop for the rest of the trip home. Apparently though, Jay sat on the intercom thingy at one point so the whole bus could hear our conversation. Ooops! How embarassing!  Dammit, I'm just getting into this blog, but I have to go now - will write more later about this trip and the one we took to the Great Barrier Reef yesterday - it was very very cool.....okay, I'm outtie! ;-)

        Butterflies, Birds, Slot Machines, Oh My!   Welcome back to the 2nd installment of  The Sheas Do Cairns ...well, I made the pilgramage to the mothership yesterday, to the Australian Butterfly Sanctuary in Kuranda - it was just like old times. I walked in the gift shop and said, "Hey, that's the scarf I bought when I was last here." The woman working the coutner said, "When were you last here?" And I told her it was 5 years ago. She seemed appalled that they had the same souveniers from 5 years back. Hehe ;-)  My dad was less freaked out by the butterflies this time. When we went to the Butterfly Conservatory in in Deerfield Massachusettes, in July, he freaked out and high-tailed it out of there and waited outside. This time he stayed in longer - we're slowly but surely immunising him. After I made my Mecca, we went to Birdworld and saw, well, lots of birds, and we walked around the markets, had lunch etc. It was freaking hot, as we expected it to be - but it was wonderful. We took the scenic railway there and the skyrail (Cable cars) on the way back - my dad once again handled it better than we thought he would. I thought he was going to freak out when we told him we had a 40 minute cable car ride ahead of us, but he was okay, well, except for the times he kept gripping the automatic door so tightly I thought he was going to yank it open while we were floating above the rainforest - ooops.   An amazing thing has happened since coming to Cairns - my parents went a whole 48 hours without gambling. No really- it's true! 48 hours with no slot machines! I was impressed. So of course we had to go to the Casino today. Before we knew it, we had been there for nearly 3 hours. I was shivering and had to go wait outside, but in the end I was the 'big winner.' I made a little over $200 on my favourite machine, "The Amazon Queen" which I chose, of course, because it had butterflies on it - Ulysses  Blue butterflies even - my favourite. ;-) So we did more walking, more markets, some walking along the esplanade - another hot but good day. Early this evening we came back and took a swim in one of our resort's pools. It was perfect - just like bath water, yet really refreshing. It's cool - it looks like a lagoon and there's a waterfall, and you're surrounded by palm trees - it was a funny change from the 'Funk Motel' in Perth. I'm used to staying in cheap really dodgy places, which suits me fine when I'm travelling alone, short on cash, and I don't intend on spending much time in the place except to sleep. I had no idea we'd be staying a ressort so big that you need a map so you don't get lost. I still haven't seen the 3rd pool. It's quite a luxurious change to what I'm used to - boy are my parents going to be heartbroken when they get back to Sydney to spend their last week in my tacky 1-star-motel apartment! ;-)  The funniest thing about the  resort we're staying in is that it's got a full-on butterfly theme. Butterflies on the tour buses, on the resort buildings, on the napkins, the soaps, even the butter is in the shape of a butterfly. My mum even swiped some butterfly coasters from the dining room to help start me a butterfly coaster collection - hahaha. I asked her if she picked this place on purpose to get on my good side, but she swears she had no idea!   Tomorrow we're going to do a cruise on the Daintree River and then go up to Cape Tribulation. I'm very excited about that! On Tuesday, we're going to go up to the Outer Reef (Great Barrier Reef of course) to do some snorkelling. Should be super! Well, I'm running out of internet time, so more updates soon....cheers!

        Greetings from an Old Spinster  This past weekend my parents were asking about my former roommates from Boston University. I've been in touch with Rachel and Gaelle, but I hadn't heard from Emily in about 2 years or so, so I said I wasn't sure what was going on in her life. Well, don't you know it, I get an e-mail from Emily today. How funny! She rang my mum in Springfield to get my e-mail addy. Anyhoo, the big news is that Emily is engaged! And to the boyfriend she had while at BU. So it's official. I am an old spinster. Rachel married Anthony two years ago (happy anniversary, guys!) and Gaelle married Alfredo at the end of last year in a civil service but they're having their wedding in France this July. I'm supposed to be a flower girl. ;-) Yes, the world's oldest flower girl! And now Em's engaged to Todd.  It is a bit odd looking like I'm 14 and actually being a 25 year-old spinster! ;-) And I can't forget my Sydney pals - the superb  urlLink Shay  and Sal are getting hitched. Everyone's doing it! Everyone's turning into a grown-up! Well, everyone except me - I'm still a baby! ;-)   Music Envy  I don't have penis envy. I have music envy. My friend Skot has 64 gigs of music on his computer. *Sob* SO jealous! Skot was kind enough to invite me over to his pad last night so I could drool over his music collection. And drool I did. Lots of great stuff, including the envy-worthy Mr. Bungle, solo Patton, Fantomas etc. stuff! So much music! I don't know how he ever manages to leave the house. I mean, really!   R.I.P., Mr. Rogers  Awwww,  urlLink Mr. Rogers  died. :(  Okay, so I may have thought the sweater and shoes things were a bit odd, but I did enjoy Mister Rogers Neighbourhood when I was a kid. I liked his simply way of explaining important 'life lessons' to children. I like adults who realise that kids aren't dumb and don't try to talk down to them. And I dug the make-believe world. Of course, I never thought I'd one day grow up to have a female boss who was the spitting image of the hideous Lady Elaine Fairchild puppet, but life is crazy and unpredictable like that! ;-) "Oh, would you be mine? Could you be mine? Won't you be, my neighbour?"  Farewell, Mr. Rogers - hope you have fun in that great big sandbox on the sky ;-)

        urlLink    'Flown the Coop,' 'Huh', and 'Stupid White Men'    Flown the Coop  Well, the parental units are heading back towards the U.S. as I type this. Can't believe their time here is already over. We survived and we're all speaking to each other, though my father has downgraded my apartment from 1 star to negative 8 stars. Though I don't feel that it's entirely fair as the ratings often had to do with my behaviour and appliances rather than the apartment itself. Like, when I failed to put mints on their pillows, I lost a star. And when the small fan my father bought for my bathroom  three years ago  wasn't still there, I think I lost two more stars. (How dare I bring it to work 3  years  later! Bad Lori! ;-) My parents are both scared about what I blogged about them while they were here - I wouldn't let them read it - hahahhaha ;-)   urlLink    Huh?  So I had a ton of errands to run today and chores around the -8 star motel to complete after my parents left. One of them was to go to the bank to drop off my bags o' change. My parents helped me put all my loose change that I've been collecting for ages into the bank bags. These bags are a lot less annoying than the coin rolls in the U.S. You just count the change and pile them in.  It took quite a while and I had about $85 - woo-hoo! So I carried the bags in my purse and it was damn heavy, but I was pleased to be depositing some cash into my bank account. Well, guess what? Westpac isn't into 'high-tech' tools for banking. The teller told me that their scales couldn't measure the bags of 5 and 10 cent pieces properly. Huh? It always measured them less than the correct amounts.  Um, sorry? She told me to go home and only put $2 (instead of $5) of 5 cent pieces in each bag and only $4 (instead of $10) of 10 cent pieces into each bag OR she could count it out for me there and charge me $1 per minute of counting even though I'd bagged the coins just like I was supposed to. Um, WHAT? How freaking stupid is that? I wanted to be like, why don't you go to Star City and purchase one of their scales/coin counting machines? Casinos are 1000x better equipped! It's a bank for pete's sake, and they aren't prepared to count money properly? I wasn't mad, just amazed at how dumb the whole thing was. I mean, all their change bags tell people to do something they're not prepared for. How hilarious is that? Mind you, thanks to my parents, the gambling addicts, I have spent a lot of time in casinos lately, in Sydney and Cairns, and so that's why I thought about them and how they're quite competent in the $ counting area. Maybe Star City can sponsor Westpac or something ;-) In any case, I had to bring half my money bags home. Oh well.  I'll re-bag 'em eventually!   Stupid White Men  Okay, I wish I was getting commission for promoting  Michael Moore's  awesome  Stupid White Men  - I've been telling everyone I know (And even people I don't know) about it for the last couple months - raving on and on about how smart and hilarious and gripping it is. I don't normally try to force books onto people, but I cannot help myself when it comes to SWM. In any case, speaking of Stupid White Men, I'm watching the Grammy's and Fred Durst just pulled a Dubya. I'm not exactly sure what he said, I mean, I could have been distracted by his stupidity and vacant look and just misheard him, but it sounded like he said something like, "I think we're all in 'agreeance' that this war needs to be over as soon as possible." Dumbass. Yeah, well, I think we're all in 'agreeance' that Fred is an idiot. That statement is so dumb on so many levels, I just don't have the energy to get into it. ;-)  Back to work tomorrow....sigh....I feel so disoriented! My body can't tell what day of the week it feels like, and I'll probably wake up tomorrow and poke my head out the door and ask my empty living room if everyone's taken their shower yet. ;-)

        urlLink    The 'Cairns Adventure' Pics   Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I'm behind in blogging for the umpteenth time as usual. I suck, I know. But in the meantime, here are way too many pics from our  urlLink Cairns Photogallery . ;-) Highlights (for me, anyway) include some (what else?) butterfly pics from Oz Butterfly Sanctuary, some views from the Kuranda sky-rail, pics of my dad's muddy socks/shoes from our rainforest adventure, me looking like a smurf or a Blue Man Group wannabe in my blue wetsuit, some coral/fish shots of Aguincourt Reef, me in the bikini I thought would give my dad a stroke, and my dad and I pretending to work out at the gym in our resort. :-)   urlLink   Just a quick note to say I really got a good laugh from my Auntie Kate's email saying that if she ever comes to visit me in Oz, that I can leave 'all that nature stuff' out - she just wants to be pointed to the gift shops and the beaches, she says ;-)  p.s. I spoke to Miss Kristikeet last night and she was very pleased to know that my mother has taken a liking to her use of "meatloaf" to replace her sailor language. My mum has been trying to use it and I throw a meatloaf in my conversation every now and then, just to spice things up!

        urlLink    I am not a hypochondriac. No, really.   And to think I thought wearing this blue lycra suit was embarassing. It looks downright stylish compared to that stupid neck collar. But that stupid neck collar is earning its keep, so I really can't complain too much about its incredibly sexy appearance.  So I took the day off from work today. Not because of my 'pain in the neck' neck but for something even more exciting. (And I swear I am not a hypochondriac.)  I woke up several times in the night feeling very congested, and then around 4am I woke up coughing and wheezing and rattling. I know, chainsmokers probably don't find this at all impressive, but for a non-smoker like me, it was a tad disconcerting to not be able to breathe well. Plus, I had all that fun sneezing, itchy/scratchy, runny nose stuff going on too. The joy of allergies. I have no idea what set this reaction off. It would be hilarious if it turned out I was allergic to my neck collar! Ever notice how when you're having trouble breathing, and you start thinking about it, you have even more trouble breathing? Love that. Around 5.30am I accepted the fact that I am a 75-year-old 25-year-old trapped in the body of a 14-year-old. My immune system is just plain pathetic.   Anyhoo, I went to the doctor I failed the breath test all 7 times. The doc actually asked me if I was 'Really trying.' He said it in that tone of voice baseball coaches use when they tell their players that they 'throw like a girl.'  Hrmph.  So he thinks I either have asthma or that my bronchial tubes are inflamed due to my allergies. He gave me a puffer that I'm to take daily (that's an inhaler to you yanks) and he is going to monitor me weekly, so we'll see how we go. No improvement yet,  but it's early and here's hoping that my bronchial passages aren't as stubborn as the rest of me! The doc had me use the puffer there in the office and then come back 45 mins later to see if there was any change. I failed the breath test again...if only I had studied harder! ;-)  Of course, I ran into someone I knew today. Poor Michael gave me the "Oh my god, were you in a car accident?" squeal. Obviously Michael doesn't know me well enough yet to know that nothing that logical or terrible would ever happen to me. I don't specialise in horrible or traumatic events - only dumb ones. Like, I wouldn't break a leg while sky-diving or skiing or something - nah, I'd be much more likely to break a bone while, I dunno,  playing tag  (No, I was not kidding about that yesterday - it really did happen!) Jorge came over to see me tonight and couldn't stop giggling. He kept making fun of how silly I looked. As long as everyone's laughing  with  me and not  at  me. :P

        urlLink    The Giraffe Who Sprained Her Neck   Do not be alarmed. I was not in a car accident, I didn't get mugged, no one tried to beat me up, and no, I didn't get into a catfight at a club.  I don't need any help getting hurt, since I am Klutzo Bizarro! I didn't even need to leave the house to hurt myself this time. I am dangerous when awake, and apparently, even when I am sleeping.   I woke up this morning, feeling fine, until I attempted to move my head/neck slightly to the left, which caused me to curse. A lot. So I slept funny and woke up with a sore neck. This happens to me once in a while, I'm like a meatloafing contortionist in my sleep and unfortunately my neck is not actually made of rubber so I do occasionally wake up with a sore neck.  However, I must give credit where credit it due. I really topped myself this time. I kept testing my available neck mobility range and was not too pleased. I used a lot of four letter words which I hope my neighbours did not hear. That's no way to wake up, after all, listening to an annoying American curse her klutzography of a sprained/strained neck.   I really thought about staying home from work today, but kept remembering things I had to do and I hate taking sickies unless I'm dying (I know, I'm insane). But I figured, how hard could it be to sit in front of a computer all day? Well, I must have blocked the blood supply to a few brain cells when I was busy twisting my gumby-like neck in my sleep last night, as guess what? I got to work and could not find any comfortable way to sit without holding my neck with one hand, supporting it. Which only left me one hand to type with. Not good.   I have never had a neck brace before. I loathe them. They look so dumb. I knew I would look so dumb. But after several hours of swearing under my breath and using my hands as a make-shift brace, I realised this was not the time to let petty pride get in the way. So I went to the chemist and the pharmacist helped me try on the neck collar, and she helpfully tried to turn my neck to the left, because, of course, that is the direction it can't turn in. I thought maybe my honest wince of pain might guilt her into cutting me a break on the collar, but alas no. Oh well.  So I look stupid, but the collar does take some of the pressure off. It does help.    I got plenty of weird looks when I walked home from work today and I realise in retrospect that it was probably more to do with the length of my neck rather than the actual collar.  Glenn came over to pick up his boxes and his TV (sob! No more remote control!) and I warned him not to freak out. I told him I was wearing a neck brace but that it was no big deal, I just strained some neck muscles from sleeping funny, yadda yadda. Of course he took one look at me and freaked out. He kept saying, "Oh god."  Then he said, "I never realised how long your neck was before."  I reassured him that I have indeed always been a giraffe with a long neck. He was like, "Well, that collar thingy sure does make your neck look longer!"  It reminded me of my modern dance teacher at BU who used to always comment about my 'swan-like neck,' my 'petite frame' and my 'perfect feet arches' - she told me I had the body of a dancer. Hahahahahaha, but that was before she found out I have the soul of a klutz.   I was explaining to a friend tonight about how I managed to screw up my neck enough to embarass myself by wearing a neck collar, just by sleeping, and he said, "Wow, You are truly one of the weirdest people I know."  He seemed so surprised that a body could do this. Was I surprised? Hell no. Let's just say that after you break your arm while playing tag and manage to dislocate your knee (the first time) while standing  absolutely  still, you don't really get too surprised by your body anymore.  It's always an adventure.

        Whatever Happened To Foreplay on the Dance Floor?   (I spent the evening on a lovely Sydney Harbour Cruise with Jorge, his friends/workmates, and 500 Macquarie Uni  foreign exchange students, most of whom were far too attractive to be real...)  Okay, I'll admit it, I want to be romanced, dammit! I'm not talking about flowers and chocolates, though those are nice, but just a little teensy-weensy bit of effort - that's all I'm asking for. When I dance, I go off in my own little world and pay virtually no attention to the drunken vulture-men who will inevitably end up circling me because a) they think I'm 14 , b) they have never seen anyone that white in Australia, or c) they're just freaks. Anyhoo, the point is, it takes a lot to get my attention, because when I do float back into reality and realise that drunk and drooling dudes are watching me dance, I avert my gaze to the floor and look anywhere but at people - no eye contact whatsoever.   So, what would be nice? Oh, I don't know, ANYthing but what actually happens. How about a non-creepy smile? Or pulling a funny dance move that will make me laugh? Or simply sticking out your hand and saying, "Hi I'm _____" (insert name here)? Or ANYthing but just ambushing me, grabbing me and starting to dance 'with' me, without any consideration of whether or not I'd like to dance with you. Come  on , dammit, gimme SOMEthing! Isn't it easier to ask a girl her name rather than to just start humping her crotch or behind? I mean, really! This one guy tonight just wouldn't give up. I spotted him and knew he was trouble, so I danced my way across to the other side of the dancefloor, but he followed. Persistent fella! Anyway, after he ambushed/attacked me in a horrible dance move, I pushed him back and made him 'introduce' himself to me with a handshake/name exchange etc, which he seemed to think was a waste of time and just start grabbing me to dance with him and he was a fantastically shitty dancer so I was like, "Sorry, this just isn't working, I'm going to go back to dancing alone."  And to woo me over, he picked me up and owalked to a chair and plopped me down in his lap, where I stayed for all of half a second before jumping up and heading back to the dancefloor where I ended up chatting with his much nicer, much saner, and very apologetic friend.   I feel bad for guys, I really do. I know it sucks feeling like you have to make all the moves. That bites, I know. But, GET SOME NEW MOVES! Smile! (Don't grab!) Flirt! (Don't grab!) Be funny! (Don't grab!) Copy the girl's dance moves - if she has a sense of humour she'll find it amusing! (Don't grab!) Introduce yourself! (And don't grab!)   Anyway, it was a fun evening, met some cool people, had some good conversations, though I felt bad cause I only saw Jorge for like 10 minutes the whole night - ooops!  Okay, must go to bed now - was out at Keren and Noa's last night until nearly 2am - they made a very nice dinner and we had hilarious chats, as I expected. I love homemade dinners, especially ones that I didn't have to make! Woo-hoo!

        Me so tired!   The hypochondriac is fine, just tired. My neck is pretty much back to normal and my breathing issues are under control thanks to my new little inhaler. I just am not getting enough sleep - but then, who does these days, right? ;-)  Busy weekend, lots of work, meetings, etc, but I did get to see Andrew's band, QuarterAcre, and Graeme's band, Seconds Away, at Vic on the Park so that was good.  And I had some good chats with Javier and Dhruv.  I really have to thank friends like Dhruv, Shayna, Javier, Brian, Rach, and others who know who they are, who never give up on me even though I have completely sucked when it comes to keeping up my side of the friendship. Poor Dhruv in particular has been trying to ring me for like the last 6 months and just got a hold of me this weekend. And Shayna just asks for a quick email every now and then and I'm just so lazy. And Javier has written actual snail mail letters and sent me tapes/CDs and  have I returned the favour yet? Nup. Why? Because I suck. I'm trying to turn my slacker ways around....it's really weird. I don't know how to explain it. I do think about these friends and I keep thinking that I must get in touch, but then I keep putting it off and the next thing you know, months have gone by.  So bad! So anyway, thanks you guys, for somehow feeling that I am worth all the effort. I hope to prove you right! Mwah! :-)  Went to see Matt's band,  urlLink Mersea , tonight. It made for a very cool Monday - I really enjoyed the set. Well done, Mr. Styx!

        Happy Belated St. Pats, "Let's Get Physical," Opera House Graffiti   Happy Belated St. Pats to my friends and fam, particularly back in the States. I had a completely sober St. Pats, nothing stronger than water. Went to go see a preview of  Punch-Drunk Love  with Jorge, Glenn, Keren, and Noa. It was the oddest movie I've seen in ages. It is definitely different to your typical Adam Sandler movie, but somehow he still seems to play a similar character ;-)   "Let's Get Physical, Physical...I wanna get PHYSICAL..."  It's not so much that I just  want  to get physical, it's more like I want to because I know I have to. Okay, I realise what I'm about to type is going to cause many rolled eyes and flippings of the birds, and "shut the hell-ups!" from my friends, but I promise I'm only going to say it once: Skinny people can still have flab. That's all I'm saying. I'm thin, but I can still jiggle! Woo-hoo! Yes, I know I am super super lucky to be one of those annoying people who can eat anything and not worry about it. I suck, I know. However, while I'm not concerned about my weight, I am concerned that I have pretty much NO tone to speak of. Am I surprised, though? Of course not. Do I DO anything that would enable me to acquire tone or become toned? Nup. I'm am one of the laziest people I know - and that's saying a lot! I sit on my ass in front of the computer all day at work, which is really not conducive to toning. I don't go to the gym (giggle) I don't work out, I don't jog, I don't run, nothing. I don't go out dancing regularly enough for it to do much long-term good and though I do walk to and from work every day, it's not like it's exactly taxing. Anyway, I'm happy with how my body looks, flab/jiggle included, but I am not happy with how my body  feels . I have no energy, and I'm tired all the time. Part of that is due to the fact I don't sleep well at night and my diet isn't the healthiest it could be, but also I know I'm just not getting enough exercise. I want my energy back! Exercising regularly should also help me sleep better. And if I get toned, I won't get sore muscles (or not as sore muscles) when I do get the crazy idea to do some kind of  actually taxing physical activity. Use it or lose it! I can't be lazy 355 days out of the year and then decide to climb some 'mountain' and think my body is going to be happy with that. Silly butterfly!  So I got an exercise urge this weekend and let me tell you, that's really rare, so any hint of the exercise bug is something to act upon immediately before it flies away forever. So I went out and bought an exercise mat, some small hand weights, and some intro pilates stuff. I'm still in desperate need of a proper pilates DVD. They have everything on VHS, but haven't found what I want on DVD yet. If anyone has any recommendations,  urlLink let me know . I love my mat and I love the little hand weights. I keep laughing during the intro pilate exercises though. I always laugh for the first half hour during anything I'm doing that requires me to relax. So during the first half hour of my meditation classes - I laughed and laughed. And let's not forget the Tai Chi classes - it was a quiet shaking chuckle at the beginning of every one...yes, I know I'm weird. :D    urlLink Opera House Graffiti   So, the war is coming soon...grrrrr X 1000000. Got this really good forward today at work. It was just an image of Dubya and Saddam with boxing gloves and the tag line was something like, "War is fun when you know you're not going to die." I thought that was really smart and true - it is a bit weird to think the two people heading the 'opposing teams' of this thing will be sending thousands of people out to fight on their behalf, killing who knows how many innocent people in the process, but their own lives will probably never be in any danger. Anyway, two dudes painted   urlLink "NO WAR"  in huge red letters on the Opera House this morning just before 9am. I'm actually quite impressed that they managed to pull this off. It's a huge embarassment as supposedly security on the Opera House and Harbour Bridge has been really tightened since November, yet these guys managed to finish off these words in huge letters before getting caught/stopped. That's pretty amazing. I'm not for scribbling all over public property of any kind, nevermind the Opera House, but I can really understand their frustration/desperation. I'm sure lots of people would have liked to do what they did. I feel bad for the poor bastards who have to restore the Opera House back to its usual self.

        Dubya is for Wanker   So I've had a lot of people ask me lately if I'm given a hard time for a) being American b) being American when there's a US led war going on that spits in the face of the UN and c) being an American in Australia when many Aussies are rightfully pissed off that they have to go to war because their Prime Minister is sucking up to George (W. is for Wanker) Bush.  The answer to a, b, and c is no. Anyone who knows me knows where I stand on all this. I am very disappointed in the decisions being made as of late and I'm embarassed to be from the same country as the Head Wanker.  There was an article I read recently in the Sydney Morning Herald - if I can find the link, I'll post it. It raised several question, including whether the Oscars should be boycotted, and talked about what Australians could do to make their voices against this war heard. The author commented that Australians giving up every-day household products from the U.S. a) wasn't that practical and b) wouldn't even make a dent anyway.  The author suggested that to make the U.S. take notice of you, you have to hit 'em where it hurts - in the pocketbook/wallet. And that's true. So the article went on about how Australians  do  make an impact in the entertainment economy - if Aussies stopped buying Yankee music, going to see Yankee movies, all that stuff, that would make the entertainment execs stand up and take notice. It's an interesting idea. What really resonated with me the most though was the feeling of, "Crap, what the hell can we do? What can we do as Australians?" I can totally understand other countries' annoyance, I mean, if the President of the United States can easily smirk at the UN and say, "yeah, whatever, thanks for playing, but we're still doing what we want to do" - it does give you sort of a hopeless pang right in the gut.   The one thing that really made me laugh in the article was how the author said something about how at least the American citizens have  some  sort of control over all this - they get to at least decide who their president is, while the rest of the world has to suffer at the hands of the elected idiot. (The elected idiot stuff is all me, btw.) But I beg to differ! Someone needs to send this writer a copy of  urlLink Michael Moore's   Stupid White Men  pronto. (Nice  urlLink Oscar speech  too, Mikey!) After all, hasn't he/she heard? We didn't actually elect our current President. He didn't actually win the Presidency, yet he's still snug as a bug in a rug in the White House. So, if you think we Americans feel like we've got any power or control at the moment, well, sorry to disappoint you!   Lots of prayers go out to my friend Jo's little brother - he's one of many British soldiers currently in Iraq. I hope he makes it home safe and sound. :(

        Chattin' with the Oldies   My father must be taking guilt-trip lessons from my Mum's mum, my little Babci, the grandma I take after physically. I love my Babci to bits, but boy is she fantastic at the guilt-trips. Well my Dad was doing a fantastic job tonight! My favourites:  1. Upon answering the phone, my dad says, "Hello? Who's this? I'm sorry, who are you? Oh it's  you , you  are  alive." 2. My dad tells me it's been 6 weeks since he's heard from me (phone-wise)....the guilt-trip implied: "I'm a terrible daughter." ;-) 3. My dad tells me he's called and left SO MANY messages on my phone and I  never  call them back. 4. "You haven't blogged in forever." (A knife through the heart!) 5. "You never sent us the photos of your lampshades like you promised."  LAMPSHADES!!!!! For pete's sake!   You get the point ;-) My mom just laughed and laughed. Thank goodness I didn't start that blog for my dad like I was going to in Cairns. Basically it would be nothing but, "Day 57...and Lori still hasn't called." :-)  Happy Belated birthday to super  urlLink Shay  and the lovely Rachel (Go, Schmoops!) I went to Shay's great b-day party on Saturday night - he had a very cool mathematical theme going since it was his cubed (3x3x3) 27th birthday - I of course went as the very predictable Butterfly Effect. I mean, could I have really gone as something else - it wasn't just a fitting concept, but it's also the title of my upcoming novel, so why fight it? ;-) (Yes, I am serious about the n word - novel.)  Had a yummy dinner in Newtown last night with Glenn, Kuan, and Jorge - pizza with mozzerella, eggplant, red capsicum, olives, and tzataki (sp?) sauce. YUM.  Jorge of course ended the evening as he always does,  announcing that I am going to grow up to be a spinster. :p  I finally went to this great African restaurant on King St. last week with Rammstein. I've been eyeing it for three years and thanks to Rammstein, I finally got my butt in there! The food was really tasty - lots of great flavours/spices - I highly recommend! We attempted to go see  Bowling for Columbine  (yes, my 2nd time) but it had stopped playing @ the Dendy that day - doh! So we saw  The City of God  instead - I really enjoyed it - it was beautifully shot - gorgeous despite of all its ugliness.   I dropped in to visit the Subway Man tonight...more about that tomorrow though, I hope :D

        I Wanna Go Home!   It's going on 9.30pm and I'm still at work...can not  wait to go home. I'm so sleepy. I have the world's babiest cold. Like it's the best cold I've ever had - I just have a headache and am sneezy. That's a wuss of a cold if I've ever had one - and I'm fine with that. I bought some cold medicine at lunch time cause I couldn't stop sneezing though, and let me tell you, it did not help my job performance. It helped the sneezing, but not my thought processes. I was having issues working on this one website because in my cold-medicine drugged up state I kept wrongly naming pages and then of course, referring to those wrongly named pages. DOH! Silly butterfly!  Last night I worked late-ish and I was being rushed out the door by my boss who was leaving, and I had just sent this batch of files file etc, then I went to dinner with Jorge, feeling less stressed since I had just sent off that project I was frantically working on last night. So you can imagine my horror when I get home around 11pm to find out that my file was rejected by the recipient - too big. It wasn't  that  big, but too big for him, so I had to get into my sent-mail and re-send each powerpoint presentation separately, which would have been no big deal if I were at work, but since I was at home on my slow-ass dial-up connection, it took like a half hour to send each file. I was up pretty late late, but the dude did get his files, just later than he expected!   I'm currently emailing clients a 15 MB file...any bets on if it'll go through? ;-)

        Home Improvements   Just a quick note to say that 'home improvements' should not be allowed to begin before 8am. I am dying to meet the person who lives in the unit above me and ask him/her why (for over a year now) they always feel the need to use a powerdrill and a hammer before 7am. Bastard! Get a new hobby - something quiet, like reading, dammit! :D

        urlLink    'Touch Me' Day   After being rudely woken up at 5am by some lovely period cramps, I washed down my last couple panadol tablets and tried sleeping on my stomach to help the contractions. While sleeping on my stomach may have been more comfortable for my uterus/abdomen, it was not so comfortable for my neck/back/arms or anywhere else. I woke up a few hours later unable to feel my left arm from the shoulder down due to the weird position I was sleeping in. My neck and back were also sore too. So what to do? Time to treat myself to a little TLC...  I needed a haircut anyway (that sheepdog effect with my bangs/fringe in my eyes just isn't a good look!) but instead of washing my hair just before going to get the snip, I decided to treat myself to a scalp massage in the form of a shampoo. Why does it never feel that nice when you shampoo your own head, dammit? So while getting my hair  shampooed by someone else was a nice treat (it's been over a year and a half I think), I felt bad for putting the hairdresser through the detangling hell. My hair looks innocent enough, but it's naughty.... very  knotty.  Anyhoo, just got an all-over trim, no biggie, but I can now see without having to push my hair out of my eyes...the scalp massage was just the pre-lude though. What I was really craving was a massage.  I really am not into the idea of those public massage set-ups where everyone can walk by and watch you getting a massage, but for $20, I couldn't resist. I got the neck/shoulders/back deal. It was fantastic. It was bordering on the slightly 'too rough' zone, but it was exactly what I needed and most of the massage was in that "oooh, baby, it hurts so good" zone (well, except for the back pummelling, he got a wee bit carried away, but oh well).  I've decided that I simply cannot go this long without a massage again.  I've also decided that the next guy I date must give somewhat regular neck/back massages. That's right, I've upped my criteria from just 'must have good hygiene,' and 'remembers my name' to 'must have good hygiene,' 'remembers my name' and 'must give me back massages.'  Call me picky. ;-) He doesn't have to give fantastic massages, he just has to be willing to try and to take instruction! I give good back massages and I'm all for equal opportunity and reciprocation! Again, if I could massage my own back, I'd be all set, but alas, my arms just aren't quite long enough.    Cleaning Up My Act   Guess where I'm sitting? Yes, at my computer, doh, but guess where my computer is sitting?  On my desk!  - you see, for the last 6 months, my desk has become yet another 'resting spot for Lori's crap' - much like any other flat surface in my apartment. But I've decided it's time to reclaim my 'writer's corner.' I've finally put my postcards up on my walls in my bedroom. In the corner where I will now be writing - this is the collection of postcards I started over 5 years ago - I've now got beautiful scenery to look at:  urlLink Sydney ,  urlLink Cairns , Hobart, Melbourne, London, Boston, Cape Cod, Dublin,  urlLink Barcelona , Paris, Phillip Island, Great Ocean Road, Bay of Islands, Taupo, (New Zealand) etc. Just gotta find my post cards from Darwin,  urlLink Perth , and  urlLink Byron Bay ...looking at the pics makes me feel very grateful. I've been lucky enough to travel to a lot of gorgeous places. I really haven't done much travelling in my day, I haven't been to many countries,  but it's still a good start.     New Shades   So I finally got new sunglasses ('sunnies'). I lost my first/last/only prescription pair about 2 years ago...these new babies are so expensive that I'll be wearing them for the next 10 years, I don't care if they go seriously out of fashion ;-) Heh. Nah, seriously, I really do like them and it's so nice to not squint in the sun. When I went to pick them up, the lady at the counter was like, 'Have you had prescription sunnies before?' and I said I had, but not for ages. And she said, 'Oh well, you need them in Australia, with this sun, it'll help with all those little lines around your eyes."  Um, WHAT?!?! I admit, I definitely do have little (not so fine!) lines around my eyes, but I was under the impression that I was the only one who could see them unless someone was standing way too close to me.  If I'm 25 but could pass for 15, I don't think I should have to deal with lines ;-) Anyway, I'm not sure if she was talking about the lines around my eyes or about getting lines around your eyes in general, but I was feeling a tad paranoid. Oh well, what can you do. Looks like I am aging after all ;-) Also, I've noticed that these eye lines get really crinkley when I smile and I smile all the freakin' time and I'd rather be smiley and wrinkley than look a tad younger and appear mean and grumpy. :D   P.S. I'm PATHETIC   I ventured out this evening to go to Broadway around 9pm. I checked the temperature online before going out to  figure out how I should dress. I was wearing jeans, a short-sleeved shirt, and a sweater. It was 18 degrees Celsius. So what did I do? I put on  another  sweater! (As all my sweatshirts/jackets that aren't fully for winter are currently in my dryer.) For all you metrically challenged yankees (hey, that includes me too, but I'm getting better with temps), 18 degrees Celsius is like 64 degrees Farenheit. SIXTY FOUR DEGREES! That's lovely and warm to normal New Englanders, but not to me - to me it felt cold and I had to wear TWO SWEATERS over a shirt! P-A-T-H-E-T-I-C!  64 degrees! That's probably about 20 degrees F warmer than what it would be in Springfield around this time of the year. I'm saaaaaaad. I've had it way too good here - now anything below 68 F feels nippy! And  when  the hell are we Yankees gonna join the rest of the world in using the damn metric system? It's just embarassing! Give it up, already! As long as you never ever plan to leave America, you're fine, but as soon as you do (and hopefully you do at some point!) you're screwed. I'm actually pretty good at working out Celsius without doing any math in my head or on paper, but I have been here long enough, so that's not particularly genius of me. It's weird, because we do have to use the metric system in science classes and what-not but it's as though we treat science class as 'magic' and as soon as we leave the classroom or the lab, the metric system fails to have any meaning for us. Can't we just pick a year and say, "Okay, from now on, we're using the metric system!" and start phasing-out our half-assed system? Or keep them both - I don't care - just as long as Americans can be in another country and understand temperature and distance.    Music Mania  Saw lots of great music this weekend! Friday night at the Hopetoun rocked acoustically,  including the sweetly sexy  urlLink Shane Nicholson , the gorgeous and powerful  urlLink Sarah Blasko , Amiel, and lil' ol' Alex Lloyd, etc. Such a great show! Everyone gave me a warm and fuzzy on that crappy cold rainy night. ;-)  On Saturday night at Vic on the Park I was extremely impressed and put in the mood to groove by  urlLink theHEAD's  debut performance. You'd think they'd done that performing thing before or something! Well done, boys! I was kinda let down by the next two acts, nothing against them, it's just  urlLink theHEAD  made me want to dance, and the mood changed during following groups - until amazing Audiophile turned up. I had intended to leave much earlier, but once these guys hit the stage, I had to stay until the end. Absolutely fantastic! If I had 10 thumbs, they'd all be up. Keep an eye out in the street press and go see everyone I just raved about. JUST DO IT (I mean, they're so good I'm infringing on Nike trademarks here, people!)    (As Craig would say, this entry was lovingly written while listening to Radiohead and Tracy Chapman, especially "Let Down" and "Big Fat Man" ;-)

        Happy Easter in Advance!   Happy Easter to all my friends and family celebrating it this weekend. I'm off to Byron Bay this weekend - yayayayayayayayay! Big thanks to Jamie for being oh so helpful in regards to Byron!  I leave tomorrow night and I won't be back until Tuesday - I'm really looking forward to it. But NOT looking forward to the 13 hour bus ride (each way) - *sob* It's funny cause I was reading the journal I kept the last time I was there and I specifically wrote, in all capital letters, I VOW TO NEVER TAKE THE BUS TO BYRON BAY AGAIN! Funny how you can find yourself eating your words - I REALLY would rather fly, but it's so much cheaper to take the bus, and well, there you go. Don't worry, Mum & Dad, I'm not intending to go sky-diving this time - but only because I can't afford it ;-)   Anyhoo, I've hopefully learned enough from last time to make this trip a bit better. I'm bringing three sweatshirts and a blanket (it was freezing last time, people actually got into their sleeping bags on the bus!), and I'll have lots of snacks and water - and the snacks will hopefully not be too garlicky or oniony so as to scare anyone  (including myself) with my dreamy breath. And I'm bringing a tooth brush  & paste in my ON-BOARD luggage this time, my CD-player and batteries, an eye mask,  and I'm buying sudafed to knock myself out as i have problems sleeping upright. And I'll pray that I don't get the only seat that doesn't recline this time. 13 hours...it's basically like flying from Sydney to L.A.!  I do hope to get that floatation tank/massage package that I got last time though...I'll need it after the bus-ride! I'm so looking forward to relaxing on the beach - hopefully I won't run into Leslie Nielson this time ;-)  Love to the Sheas, McGuires, Colsons, Cullens, Laczeks, Shea-Roberts, Downies, etc.   I'm outtie! :D

        More ways to procrastinate from writing my novel...   Well, if I'm going to procrastinate from writing the old novel, at least I'll be doing it by writing. I got into my freelance journalism course - yay! It starts next week. It's always full whenever I try to register for it, but not this time, dammit! I've had ideas for articles floating around for ages and I'm hoping the deadlines for assignments set during the course (one every week) will motivate me to FINISH SOMETHING for once, dammit! And of course I'm doing this in 'crunch' time. I know it sounds silly, but I was hoping to have my first novel (ha!) finished (at least a draft of it) while I was still 25 and I'll be 26 in just over a month...and considering I'm NO WHERE close to that goal, of course I go and sign up for a class ;-) Typical Lori. Oh well, just gotta do the best I can.  In the meantime, if anyone has any burning questions to ask the comedian  urlLink Jimeoin , hurry up and  urlLink email me  as I'm interviewing him tomorrow. Personally, I think he's just putting on the accent....kidding, kidding.  Oh, I had wonderful Spanish Tapas tonight at my favourite Tapas place in Glebe with Rammstein - yum! And thanks to the awesome Rammstein I now have a functional phone! YAYAYAYAYAY! It vibrates! I can hear callers in public! I can hear calls in public! I now have predictive text! I have a calendar/organiser! It's all very exciting! Of course I was trying to show off and send Rammstein a text message after he left and screwed it up and sent him 2 blank messages instead, so I have a bit more practicing to do....ooops!   Sweet dreams!

        Okay, I admit it, I am a pervert...   I tell you, if I could be anywhere right at this very moment, it would be in the  Rove Live  studios. I adore the adorable Rove McManus on his own, but who else is on tonight? Matthew "Dimples" McConnaughey. Okay, so acting isn't his strong point, but dimples go a long way with me. And even more exciting is - my beloved Hugh Jackman. *pine*  I heart Hugh. Between him and James Marsden, I really don't care if  X-Men 2  is total crap (not that I think it will be), but it would still be worth it just to perv on those two. However, it seems like Cyclops is getting majorly shafted this time around so no doubt I'll be drooling most over Wolverine. Oh, and wait, there's more on Rove tonight...the musical act is Audioslave. Sigh....I went to see Audioslave on Friday night @ the Hordern Pavilion. Absolutely fantastic. They may only have 3 songs, but 'Chris Cornell's Amazing Arms' put on a show of their own. The band played well, Chris sang well, and his biceps did a gorgeous mating dance across the stage. My friend Skot had to put up with me yelling for Chris Cornell to take off his shirt, but alas, he never did. :(     I swear I will put up my Byron Bay pics soon...I don't have too many, just some beach/waterfall shots, but hey, better than nothing. It was a lovely lazy weekend with some good food, good company, pretty scenery, and much better weather than rainy old Sydney!   Big thanks to Glenn, for being so sweet and thinking of me while in Adelaide over Easter. He found the Pilates for Dummies DVD I've been searching for and bought it for me as an early birthday present. And a huge belated thank you to Rammstein for the beautiful butterfly brooch from Turkey. I have been photographing some of my favourite butterfly collection items, so there were soon be pics of some b-fly shoes, the lovely brooch, my musical butterfly bath sponge, and no, sorry, no pics of the butterfly g-string, my funniest b-day gift from last year. ;-)

That I am sure of.  3. Was the 13-hour bus ride to and from Byron Bay horrible?  Pretty much.  4. So how did you survive it?  By trying to have an out-of-body-experience for 13 hours each way.  5. Was the fun you had in Byron Bay worth all the pain and suffering on the bus?  Yes, yes it was.   6. Will you ever take the bus to or from Byron Bay ever again?  No. And this time I mean it!  7. Did you run into your Leslie Nielson look alike?  No, thank goodness. And no one called me Lorraine. *shudder*  8. Why have you been so terrible about writing in your blog?  Because I'm lazy. Hello! Have I not made that clear time and time again?  9. When will you put up a proper blog update?  Um...tomorrow night....maybe?  10. Are you a compuslive liar?  No, of course not. ;-)  Sweet dreams! :D

        School Rocks!   My class was fantastic. I love the teacher - he is so hilarious and he seems really positive. He is realistic - he's confirmed what we already knew - that getting published (and paid) ain't a piece of cake because there's plenty of competition out there - but it's all about persistence and cranking those stories out. We all did the 'go around the room, introduce ourselves, and explain what we do, where we're from, and what we want out of the class' thing. That's normally a tedious thing, but it must be done and we did pretty well. It seems like a very interesting and diverse group, so that's cool. There are 20 of us, and it's fairly equal in the gender area - if anything, there are more males, which is quite different from the writing classes I normally take.  We had a brief writing exercise which involved just listing interesting or non-interesting things about ourselves. My list made people laugh - sorry, that's all I'm going to reveal here! Anyhoo, I'm very inspired - yay!

        X-Men and Girl Talk   It was quite a good weekend with the exception of a few tense work moments..but let's not dwell on that now..Friday night I saw  X-Men 2  with Damian and crew and it totally rocked. Didn't show quite enough of Hugh Jackman/Wolverine's bod, but overall, I was pretty happy. And I was very psyched to see the female characters kicking some major ass! Go ladies!  Saturday night I had lots of good girl chat with the lovely Claudine. We had dinner at Kilaminjaros on King St., Newtown, (that African restaurant I mentioned last month) and it was just as yummy as last time. We then headed to Gloria Jeans in the city and stayed there until they kicked us out, then headed over to Paddy Maguires where Chad eventually joined us.   Today I had lunch with Jorge and had a good catch-up. I got a fair bit of writing done this weekend too - so that was good. I had to buy a new journal as I finished the last one. Hope to get through this one faster ;-)   My interview with Jimeoin on Friday went okay considering he rang me early and I was totally not ready for him and horrified that I was caught offguard - but I recovered okay, I think. He offerred to join my imaginary band after I told him about it, but insisted that he would be the lead singer and that I would be the triangle player, but I said, "No way, buddy!" ;-) More about that later...  The funniest phone call I got this weekend was from Fleur who called me from Melbourne to ask if I wanted to go on a single's cruise next year. I was laughing like, "Gee, you have such faith in us, thinking we'll both still be single a year from now!" ;-)

        Swimming to Class?   I'm about to head off to my freelance journo class - hopefully I'll be walking and not swimming - it has been pouring on and off all day in Syd - beginning this morning as I was trying to walk to work, with no umbrella and no raincoat. I was a good 15 minutes away from work when the downpour began and I realised that I would  never  get dry all day and should race back home, change, or grab new clothes to put on at work, put them in a plastic bag, and come back to work with a raincoat. However, just as I was about to head home, a tall 20-something woman came up to me and asked which way I was heading. I surprisedly said "Surry Hills" - and she said that was on her way and she proceeded to share her umbrella with me as we walked towards Surry Hills. That was all fine and dandy and incredibly fantastic of her until I realised that she was trying to pick me up. (A little of the, 'Are you seeing anyone? Would you like to meet up for a drink some time?" thing) Ooops! But, ummm, I couldn't let on that I wasn't at all interested in her and that I dig guys until I got closer to my office, due to the rain. I am evil, I know...but what the hell??? This is the second time a woman has hit on me in Sydney using an umbrella in a downpour. Weird. Do I give off some sort of "Lesbian Damsel in Rain Distress" vibe? I mean, it's all very flattering, but still...  Really looking forward to class tonight - should be good!

        Happy Mum's Day, Mum!   Happy Mother's day to my Mum! And to her Mum, my grandmum aka Babci. And to Auntie Kate, Auntie Jo, and Auntie Nancy. Congrats on bringing all of us kiddies into this world and not killing us for being too exasperating over the years. ;-)  The Butterfly Backpackers aka Chez Shea just said farewell to its lastest guest, Heather, who left today to move to Melbourne. I told her she better find some place nice to live, because I want some place nice to stay when I come to visit. ;-)  I missed seeing Davros in Sydney for the billionth time, so once again I realise I've only ever hung out with him in Melbourne and Tasmania and never in Sydney. Weird.  On Friday night, had dinner with Heather and the boys @ Spanish Tapas and I went to see  X-Men 2  for the second time - their first time. Yes, I am obsessed. Yes, I love Hugh. And yes I did tear up at the end even though I obviously knew what was going to happen!  Yesterday we went to the Glebe Markets, as did apparently most of the city - it was jam-packed, likely due to the amazingly warm weather. We were freezing in the shade, burning in the sun. It was great.  I bought 5 used books for less than the price of 1 new hardcover. Yay! I have new books to read! I needed some new stuff to carry me over until the new Harry Potter arrives ;-) After the markets we went to Otto's and I had a yummy baked haloumi sandwich with mushrooms, tomatoes, lettuce and mayo - mmmmmmmm. I'm right into haloumi at the moment....love that stuff.  Last night I went to see Jimeoin @ the Enmore and my god, I have never seen so many couples in one place before! I didn't realise that Jimeoin had such a 'couplish' audience. Maybe it's because he doesn't offend or make fun of one sex more than the other? No idea - anyhoo, it was a great show and my cheeks actually hurt from smiling/laughing so much. Unfortunately I cannot tell my favourite joke here, as well, it's a little too blue for mother's day... ;-)  Today was a lazy day, I just read my new books and did some writing, and I did squeeze in a massage....I'm hooked. And they know what I want as soon as I walk by - "Neck, shoulders, back?" Yup! Hell yeah! I really needed it - my neck still isn't quite the same since I hurt it and ended up wearing that stupid neck brace. And my back is full of knots from sleeping funny, so it was well worth the embarassment of having a 'public massage' in order to work out some of those knots...  Okay, gotta go call me mum!

        Sun? Huh?   Wow. We saw the sun today. It was amazing. It was weird. It was like seeing an old friend and not being able to remember when exactly you last saw them. I believe it's been raining nearly non-stop for over a week in Sydney, but can't really remember when it started. But apparently it has stopped! Yay!  Had brunch with Craiggles in Newtown today and had yummy poached eggs on toast, the best hashbrowns I've ever had in Australia, mushrooms, tomatoes, and baked beans, mmmmmm! It was great to catch up and get the update on Craig's latest and greatest artists, the lovely  urlLink Sarah Blasko  and  urlLink Holly Throsby . Then at Craig's place, we watched Sarah's cool red video and saw funny Frenzal Rhomb and Neil Hamburger clips and I finally saw Adrian dressed as Ronald McDonald at the Big Day Out this year, before Frenzal went on, getting a TV smashed over his head. (Yes, this was set-up.) I was disappointed that I missed this in person as I was waiting outside the BDO to give tix away, but hey, I saw it up close and personal on this hilarious DVD.   Yesterday I went to Kuan's house for his housewarming in Paddington and it was so good to see everyone and catch up on heaps of gossip. Now Kuan is living with the hilariously wonderful Haylin and the charming Justin. It's such a beautiful place and everyone was so nice. And Ray gives a big shout-out to Miss Kristen! :-D  After that, we headed to Fox Studios in an attempt to see  urlLink Mr. Chad  DJ, but alas, we got there just as The Chad was packing up his gear. :( :( Unfortunately he set was cut 2 hours short due to the soccer, so we missed the music, but at least we got to chat to Chad and Claudine and Amanda and Fidelma for a little bit. Then, of course, it was off to Coogee Beach for some yummy pizza with C + C around 2am. We munched away on pizza while admiring the beach hoodlums (mostly drunk british backpackers who thought it would be a good idea to strip down to their skivvies and take a dip into the rather violent and huge waves - doh!) I have never seen that tide in so far or the waves that big - bizarre! There was a big (not quite full) moon overhead, so that probably explains the waves and the loonies ;-) You just gotta love the dodgy Coogee Beach Hotel Clientele!  Friday night we went to see  Whale Rider  - oh my lord - if you haven't seen this movie yet, please do. Absolutely wonderful, amazing, sad, inspirational, and heart-breaking. Did I mention you should bring a box of tissues? I was bawling...I mean, I do cry at comedies, so I wasn't that surprised, but boy was I feeling dehydrated after it was over! ;-)  And now I'm trying to finish my journo class assignment as it is due on Tuesday....better get back to it!  So looking forward to more sun all this week! :-D

        Just Say No!   I really need to learn how to lie faster sometimes...like whenever your boss asks you what you're doing over the weekend, you should  always   always  have definite plans so you are not available to do whatever he/she is about to ask you to do. Actually, in this case, I did have loose plans to go to the Sydney Writer's Festival on Sunday, but I'd already stupidly agreed to do this other work thing before I remembered.  So, this afternoon, I am going to a Rugby League Game @ the SCG and I have to take at least 10 good quality, useable, high res photos of fans. That in itself isn't too daunting. What's scary is that I also have to get everyone I take photos of to sign release forms saying they give us permission to use photos of them in advertisements in the Rabbitohs Supporters Magazine and on the Arrive alive website. So that means convincing anywhere from 10 to 50+ people to sign release forms. Oh, and of course, the other challenge is that there can't be any alcohol (beer) showing up in these photos. So I'm supposed to find the craziest, most dressed up fans. Bring on the Rabbitohs colours, bring on the facepaint, bring on crazy poses. I tried my damndest to bribe friends to come with me - but no one would come, not even with a free ticket. It's just as well, as it will be a lot easier to make a fool out of myself without a friend right there, laughing at me. Oh, and did I mention that it's POURING rain now? I am going to do my best, but I am definitely lacking confidence in myself. I suck at asking strangers to do things for me...but here's hoping that I am able to pull this off!   Oh, and what have I learned from this lesson? That I need to learn to say no much faster. I am hereby officially 'busy' every other weekend from here on in ;-)

        Brain-dead and hungry   Lordy I am beat. Just spent three hours with a client, going over their website (it seemed like 1000 pages!) in painstaking detail, and this was after working on the site yesterday from 9.30am to 10pm and working on it about 80% of the day, every day for the last week.  Lots of content, plenty of html, menu organising, and a shitload of image manipulation to remove unsightly backgrounds and other undesirable things.  I didn't each lunch today cause I was busy working on the site (as I kept receiving more info for it until about 15 minutes before I had to leave for the meeting)  and now I am STARVING! I need to not look at the site until tomorrow morning. I need a break!  Must go get food!!!!

        The REAL Hardcore Gang Members   Okay, the official verdict is in - the last remaining HARDCORE troopers for Sal's Hen's Party and Shay's Bucks Party were: me, Claudine, Chad, and Bart. It is 7.30am and we all just got home. We just had breakfast at McDonalds because that's all that was open at 6.30am. Granted, Shay, Sal, and Chris and Chantal all left slightly earlier for good reasons, but I feel like the last 4 of us won Survivor or something!  Anyway, it was hilarious and fun evening and I look forward to seeing the pics. Lots more to blog about, but now me needs to sleep! I hate going to bed when it's light and sunny out!

         IN WIZARD NEWS:  I Heart Harry Potter   Yes, I still love Harry. So much so that I felt compelled to dash to the bookstore to grab my pre-ordered copy of  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  yesterday before leaving for  urlLink Shay and Sal's  wedding at 10.30am. I am mildly embarassed by this, but for the record, no, I would not have risked being late for the wedding to get this book. Harry was my date for the wedding as I didn't have time to go back home and drop him off before heading to the church. He was in my purse the whole time.  So I started the new Harry on Saturday evening and finished it by 8pm on Sunday. All in all, I estimate that it took about 10-11 hours for me to read the whole thing. I was distracted for a couple hours by Jorge who came to find me at Broadway and attempted to have a conversation with me while I was devouring Harry. I did actually pay attention to him and did not mention (much) that he was coming between me and Harry. :-)   I was a bit surprised about the ending, but I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, so I'll shut up and just say that I did enjoy it immensely, I was very tense waiting to find out which character J.K. Rowling had to kill off in this book. Damn all the newspapers for letting that out - on every page I was like, "No! Not HIM/HER!" ;-) More about Harry later....now back to the REAL WORLD...   IN MUGGLE NEWS: Wedding Bells   HUGE congrats to  urlLink Shay and Sal ! Mr. & Mrs. at last! The ceremony was absolutely lovely, (my family would have loved it - very nice Irish Catholic wedding!), Sally was beyond gorgeous, Shay was dashing and handsome, the bridesaids and groomsmen looked fantastic, the Bishop was hilarious, and they couldn't have gotten better musicians for the wedding - the fabulous FourPlay played beautifully - especially some stunning Jeff Buckley.  The reception was also superb - heaps of fun, indeed. I felt very honoured to witness it all - thanks, guys! Hope you're having an awesome honeymoon - *wink, wink, nudge nudge* :-)    IN MORE MUGGLE NEWS: Happy Birthday, Mum!   Happy Birthday to my Mum for Friday! I did remember her birthday on time, just didn't blog about it! My parents are currently in Las Vegas, hopefully quadruple-ing my inheritance @ the slot machines (kidding, kidding...doubling will do! ;-)  Good luck, guys!   IN MORE MORE MUGGLE NEWS: I am a terrible daughter!   Happy Belated Father's Day, Dad! Um, yeah, so I'm a terrible daughter. I forgot to ring my father on Father's Day. I forgot Father's Day period. But it's not my fault! Australians don't celebrate Father's Day in June! It's in September here or something. Not that this is an acceptable excuse for my Dad, but, hey it's the truth! Sorry, Dad! :D

        Happy 4th of July, little yankees!   I wish I could say we had a lot of 'freedom' to be celebrating this Independence Day, but with our Head Monkey (Dubya) screwing things up left and right, I'd most like the U.S. to be free of him at the moment.    Brrrrrrrrrrrrr!   I am a bigger wuss than ever with this Sydney winter stuff. Over the weekend it was quite lovely - getting to 20ish zone (60s, even high-ish 68 sometimes). But this week has felt really really cold. It's only been in the 50s, but to me it feels like below freezing. How sick is that? And it's extra freezing in our office. We have no heat or air-conditioning in our office.  It's an old building, so it's not that surprising. But what is surprising is how we never get used to how freaking cold it is. Today I wore a bra, a tank top, a t-shirt, a sweater, a thin jacket, and a winter jacket ALL day at work. My hands and feet were like ice all day.  I keep hoping we'll get some office heaters, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen. :(  I have to keep alternating between sitting on my left hand and typing with my right and vice versa. I sit on my hands to warm them up. I took off my boots and sat in a yoga-like position the other day to try to warm up my feet. Pathetic.  And I can see my breath when I go to the ladies' room. I swear I try to 'hold it' as long as I can because the idea of having to pee in that freezing bathroom terrifies me.    Tonight, after work, I went straight to the store to get thermal underwear, gloves, and a scarf. I can't find my gloves from last year - bummer. I had cut off the finger tips so I could type while wearing them.    In any case, I think I may never be able to live in a U.S. state that has a cold winter ever again. Australia has ruined me! I have been so pampered by the lovely warm weather here - Oz has undone 22 years of work! ;-)   Letter to My Daughter   An email I wrote to Miss Kristen today:  Young lady, for the record,  THIS  is a gelatinous whale!  I never want to hear you compare yourself to this gross thing again! You are beautiful!   urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/science/07/02/giant.find/index.html   love you! MC   (This is due to the fact that lil' Kristen has no idea that she is perfect and keeps mistakenly referring to her non-gelatinous ass as being a gelatinous whale. Bad girl!) ;-)  Note my new 'tough love' program of embarassing Kristen on my blog to get her to shape up her attitude! ;-)   Workin' it   Work has been insanely busy lately. I need to clone myself. Seriously. Too many websites, not enough time! I'll be flying up to Coffs Harbour on Monday morning for the  urlLink UniGames , so that should be a nice change to work out of the office.  Yes, I will be working! But all work outside the office is welcomed at the moment - anything has to be warmer! ;-)   Messages   Mum + Dad, I promise to ring you soon (no, really!)  And Auntie Kate, I am alive, and I will mail you soon! (no, really!)    Musical Recommendations    Everyone in Sydney NEEDS to get his/her butt down to the Metro on Sunday, July 6th, to see the amazing and angelic  urlLink Jason Mraz !!! I'll see you there! :-)   Everyone in Sydney NEEDS to get his/her butt down to Vic on the Park tonight (4th of July) to see theHEAD and their great support line-up. It's theHEAD's album launch and I have a copy of their album and it's QUITE YUMMY! Plus theHEAD have their own awesome additional players, including the very exciting Danny Heifetz (from Mr. Bungle, Secret Chiefs 3), and the hilarious and pink  urlLink SPOD .   Go forth and gig!   Back to Brrrrr!   You know what it's like when you just can't shake a chill? My apartment is 100x warmer than my office, yet I can't shake this chill I've had this last week, so I have resorted to using my hair dryer to warm me up and my blankets/sheets too. My regular old fan heater just ain't cutting it. P-A-T-H-E-T-I-C. What is wrong with me? Why am I finding this cold???  Anyhoo, back to the hair dryer...

        The Things I Do For Work...    urlLink    Yeah, so this photo is about 2 months old now, but it still cracks me up and I never talked about it here, so you're all gonna pay now! I mentioned in a May blog that I needed to learn to lie faster when getting asked by a boss what I'm doing on a Sunday....and this photo is a warning of what can happen when you can't think of a fib quickly enough...I ended up taking photos at this Rabbitohs game (that's Rugby League for all you yankees scratching your heads back home) .  I was supposed to get at least 9 photos that would be good enough for print in an ad in a magazine. If it was just stuff for the web, I wouldn't have been worried - hell, thanks to PaintShopPro and PhotoShop, I can look like I take much better photos than I actually do (for the web) - but when it comes to print quality, yikes...anyway, it was a long day of me begging people to let me take their photos AND getting them to sign release forms saying it was okay to use their photos online and in a print magazine while not disturbing them during the actual game. Bless those kind souls who took pity on me.  You can check out the  urlLink Rabbitoh Fan gallery , if you've got some time on your hands.  Special thanks to the older man with the Bunny and the brave man who kissed a stranger's  Bunny, just to impress me. You rock! Oh and if you're wondering why there's one pic in the gallery that looks odd, it's because I had to Photoshop a cup of beer out of the photo for the website and I did a really dodgy job.  ;-)  And yes, this photo is more proof that I look dumb in all hats - this Bunny Beanie probably would have been cute on any other person, but I just can't  not  look silly in hats. (Except maybe cowboy-type/Akubra hats...don't ask me why, maybe it's because my hair is more 'mane' than hair, but for some reason I think I can pull them off...of course this may just be my own opinion ;-)   urlLink  Uni Games     Oooh, I'm only about 2 weeks behind on this - wow! Yeah, so these were  urlLink 2 crazy days up in Coffs Harbour . I was so tired and sore from lugging around 2 digital cameras, 1 digital video camera, my laptop, cables, cords, batteries, notebooks, release forms, luggage etc. etc. It was fun, but exhausting.  I'm very impressed by how organised it all was though - I only wish I could had more time to check out Coffs. It seemed very pretty, but I didn't see much of it as I was just running from event to event.  There were lots of funny and friendly student athletes up there and I got some good quotes.  You should have a look at the  urlLink 70s Night Gallery  for a good laugh - there are some great get-ups in there. The funny thing was, I just wanted to take photos of the people there, but everyone kept wanting me to get in the photo too and I kept politely declining (or trying to) but some people just insisted...    So, what have I been up to lately? Same ol' stuff...keeping up with the ol' writing - working on a few articles, some short stories, and my novel which is nowhere closer to completion since I last mentioned it.  But I'm enjoying the actual process of writing, so that's what counts...at least I have to keep telling myself that as my progress is verrrrrrry slow. ;-)   Belated B-Days   Happy Belated Birthday to Ruth, whom I celebrated with on Wednesday @ the Four In Hand, and Happy Belated Birthday to  urlLink Bart , whom I celebrated with on Saturday @ the Townie.  To think, I've been going to the Town Hall Hotel in Newtown for nearly 4 years, and Sat. night was my first time sitting downstairs. I kept gaping, going, "Huh? They have a DJ? What? There's a dancefloor?"  And my god, I've never seen so many freaky-ass hair-dos all in one place.  Very exciting! ;-)   Indian Fetish   I just realised that the owners of my favourite new Indian restaurant ( The Clove, on Crown St - near corner of Oxford St  - in Paddington) must think I'm the biggest hussy because I keep going in there with a new guy...so far I've been with Jorge a few times, and recently I went with Rammstein and then with Gavin.  But I'm only a hussy for their yummy butter chicken, I swear....damn, I can almost taste it now....I'm hungry!  :-(  I do have more Lori Stories to tell, but I'm tired and ready for bed (okay, this is a big fat lie, I'm going to watch a bit of  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  and then I'm going to bed).  Nighty night!  p.s. Kristen, you really do have to write that book!  I can Photoshop incriminating photos of you, J-Lo, and Ben  Affleck, and I will personally fly all the way to Ohio to  smack you if I ever hear you say again that your butt is bigger than J-Lo's! ;-) Cluck! Cluck!

        Trying to climb up that ol' family tree...   So I moved 10,000 miles to get away from my family and now I'm trying to track down long lost relatives in Australia. Go figure! JUST KIDDING, GUYS! Okay, well, I'm not kidding about the tracking down relatives thing, but I was just joshing about moving all the way here to get away from you :-)  It's only taken nearly 4 years of nagging from dear Auntie Kate to really get me doing my research now. Over the years I have been collecting names and addresses of people with the last name Rahilly living in Oz. There are quite a few, but not  that  many. It's not an impossible number. But I haven't contacted any of them yet.   So hey, if your last name is Rahilly, and you live in Oz,  urlLink let me know  and we'll compare notes to see if we might be related. ;-)  During my first hardcore night of family tree research  I found a woman I am pretty darn sure is a relative - or it sounds likely at least. From what she's written, it seems like her grandfather and my great-granmother may have been siblings. I'm not sure where she lives, but she's also looking for her Australian Rahilly relatives, so if our stories work out right, then maybe we can help each other. Haven't heard back from her yet though - but here's hoping.   I also accidentally stumbled across a really cool idea for a story, based on the messages in the bulletin boards I was reading about Rahilly. Something that I read there really shocked me and I'm going to use it as the inspiration for a story...inspiration really does happen in the unlikeliest of places!   Impending Trip Home   Yes, yes, I'll be making my pilgrimage back to ye olde United States in about a month's time. Springfield or BUST! :-) As soon as I have details, I'll let you guys know. Well, I have to let my parents know first or they'll never let me hear the end of it! :-)

        urlLink    Cluck cluck!  So I've been freaking out all day because I tried to call Miss Kristen fairly regularly from 7am-1pm and I couldn't get through on either the mobile or the home phone. So, I'm sorry, but I have no news.  :(  I just want to know my little daughter made it through okay! Hang in there, Kristikeet, I will try to ring you tomorrow. I'm guessing that maybe the massive power outages that also affected Cleveland may have contributed to the cell phone probs and the network congestion (I kept getting busy signals and/or 'network congestion' messages.)  Cluck, cluck!   On the Home Front  So, the countdown is on...I can't believe it won't be long now till I see the fam. Please save some of that warm weather for me - hell, I'll even take hot and humid! Puh-lease?   On the 'Removed' Home Front  I've just mailed out several letters to potential long lost relatives, in hopes of getting more family tree info...here's hoping I sent them to some of the right people!   urlLink    Happy Belateds  Happy belated birthday to: Ray, Haylin, Heather, and Jorge! So many Leos! How do I put up with you all!  Oh, and happy birthday to another favourite Leo - Dr. N! You know who you are! :-)  Speaking of belated birthdays, here is a belated birthday pic of me from June. Yeah, I know that's pretty slack, but I still haven't put together my online galleries of Barcelona and Paris from last year, so two months behind on b-day pics? Pffffffft. That's nothing! I can do much better than that.   You got the write stuff, baby....  Yeah, that was lame, I know - anyhoo, I think I have class on Sunday. I think. I only think I do because though I registered for the class this week, I didn't hear back any confirmation yet, and the class is on Sunday. I didn't think of this until after 5pm. Doh. So I am going to hope for the best and turn up. And if I didn't make it into the class, oh well, I'll be up early and raring to go to write - somewhere!  Yes, I do realise it is somewhat sad to have to keep taking classes in order to keep myself motivated, but hey, whatever works, I say!   What's been goin' on?  The same ol' stuff, and some funny stuff. I been gigging, dancing at 80s parties, going to b-day parties, catching up with friends over dinner, the usual. Oh, and I might actually blog sometime about going to  urlLink Sexpo  - it was pretty funny, but there were a few surprises...

        Frickin' Groundhog Day  It's not just a movie, it's kinda my life this week. Guess who are outside my window AGAIN? It's the frickin' manhole-men. They're scraping and lifting crap and making lot of noise. I can see ass-cracks from the window. Not a pretty sight.  I got home from work around 10.15pm (yes, another Groundhog Day event) and there they were. I kept hoping as I rounded Broadway that they would not be here. What are they DOing? I'm going to try to sleep with headphones tonight as the bastards woke me up at 2am and 4am.    Relative Re-cap  Today I got two interesting emails. One was from a Rahilly woman that I don't think I'm related to, but the other one was from the woman I was trying to find, the mother/grandmother of the guys I spoke to/got voicemail from. The first woman says she would like to tell me about her Rahilly family and I'd be happy to share the little info I know of the other Rahilly families that lived in Ireland in the same area my Rahilly relatives are from - maybe I could help her out a bit. And as for the woman I was looking for, she sounds so nice! She said I was welcome to ask her anything I like and that if I'm ever in Queensland, I should come over and meet the extended fam! How nice is that? Gotta love the Aussie hospitality. She is fairly confident that her husband was indeed my great grandmother's nephew.  Very cool.    5 Minutes Late  So I am always running 5 minutes late. This is what I do. :) Tonight my plan was to leave work around 6.10 and go to Bondi Junction to pick up my plane tix and then go back to work to work. Well, all the ticket machines that accepted bills were out of order, so with the waiting in line and the slow train I was on, I didn't get to the travel agent until about 5 minutes after they'd closed. Doh! Oh well, will have to go on Saturday in between my other errands/appointments.  Saturday should be interesting - I have to finish my homework for my Sunday writing class too - so much for doing it early - Procrastination Queen I Am! :-)

        They're back!  What the hell is underneath the road outside my apartment that's so important that they need to make so much noise and work on it late at night? Is there gold under there or something? ;-) Tonight I'm going to try keeping a CD on repeat and see how that blocks things.   Web Savvy Relatives?  So I had my phone off at work today, but the father of the boy who rang me from Brisbane last night left a message. He was just confirming again that the woman I named in my letter was in fact his mother. He said he would fax the letter to her and that she would probably get back to me "via email because she's right into that stuff!" Hahahahaa! She's got to be in her 70s and she's right into the email. I love that! But he also mentioned the suburb she lives in up in Queensland and I think I sent a letter directly to her as well - in any case, all bases are covered there. This guy said his mum would have a lot more information for me. Very exciting!  Just got home from work, so I'm exhausted and googly-eyed. Can't believe that I'll be heading to Chicago/Springfield/Boston in less than two weeks! Crazy!

        Contact!  So I heard back from one of the people I sent a letter to on the weekend, and yes, it is a long-lost Australian relative - yay! Around 9pm tonight I was at work and I received a phone call that I almost didn't answer as I didn't recognise the number. Luckily I answered - it was the grandson of this one relative I was looking for, so I was on the right track! We only spoke for a couple minutes since I was at work and he was ringing my mobile (which is expensive) so he said he'd have his dad get back to me as he would be totally into the whole family tree thing.  So I'm very pleased and look forward to hearing from them and perhaps others, soon.    Me so tired  I got home from work tonight just before 11pm - sooooooo tired. I kept hoping the rain would stop so I could walk home umbrella-less, but that just didn't happen. Anyway, I did get a lot of work done, so I'm very glad about that.  We are going to be crazy busy for the next several weeks and I have a lot to cram in my remaining two weeks at work (before going to visit the fam in the U.S.) - so many projects happening, one in particular being the lovely site for  urlLink FBi Radio , on air from the 29th of August - woo-hoo!    Cranky Pants  I just hope I get more sleep than I did last night. I don't know who the hell they were or what the hell they were doing, but there were lots of men making lots of noise outside my building last night, just below my window. And they were making all this noise from 10pm until about 5am! GRRRR! They kept making all these scraping/hammering sounds and they were going down the manhole, doing lord knows what.  I could even hear what was being said on their walkie talkies!  Very important stuff like "Steve, do you need any coffee? Over!" and "Steve, what do you see down there?" and "Steve, white with 2 sugars? Over!"  "Copy that."   I just wanted to sleep, dammit. I kept thinking of  Ghost Busters II  and I was hoping they would get slimed ;-)  They're equipment is back again tonight (nooooooo!) but there's no sign of the boys yet, so maybe it's too wet for them to come out and play tonight. (Fingers crossed!)

        Cluck Cluck II!  I spoke with lil' Kristikeet on Saturday for a good hour - she's hanging in there like the little trooper that she is. The poor thing - to have a massive power outage AND a fire occur at the hospital you're in, the day you're having surgery - jaysus. I was like, "What else could possibly go wrong? Tornado? Locusts? Earthquake?" Thankfully our little Miss Kristen is at home now, recovering, slowly but surely. Take it easy, young lady! :-D    Writing the Novel  I had class today from 10am-4pm and I was actually on the list even though I hadn't received enrolment confirmation, so at least I wasn't a loser showing up for the class, which was, surprise, surprise, called "Writing the Novel."  There were 9 of us, and I have to say, none of us were feeling that perky at 10am. I personally was not really functioning. I mean, my friends know never to ring me before 11am (at least!) on a Sunday. It just isn't right. Anyway, overall it was a good class, though we definitely could have been given more time for some of the assignments. We literally had 5 minutes to plan the genre, theme, and plot ideas for a novel that we were essentially making up on the spot and then we only had 5 minutes for creating character charts for characters we were also making up on the spot.  What the???   I was going to use my current characters/novel-in-progress at the beginning, but it was actually easier to make new stuff up because I would have had too much to work with in 5 minutes using the old stuff. However, I will go back and apply the tricks and techniques we learned today to the stuff I have been working on these last couple years.  I was relatively pleased with what I came up with during the class - nothing amazing, but not bad considering I didn't sleep well last night. And I did actually work on a piece for my never-ending novel-in-progress during one assignment (in which we had 10 whole minutes!) so that was good.   As I was leaving the building to head back toward my 'hood, this guy in my class came up behind me and said, "You know, I really think you will be the first in the class to finish your novel!" And I laughed and said, "God, I hope not! I'll probably be like 99 when I finally finish it, so you better hope I'm not the first one!" And then he said told me I was the most "natural writer" in the class, which is total bullshit as  everyone  in that class could write well and there was some really amazing stuff that came out during the free-writing exercise. I was very impressed.   After the class I went and got my new usual soy chai and wrote for another 2 hours at Broadway. Yay! I'm going for quantity not quality at the moment - just getting myself back into the habit of regular writing, ignoring whether I am "inspired" or not.    So Taxing  Big thanks to Rammstein for being so patient with my stupid tax deduction questions. You're the best. :-)   Chicago, Chicago  I finally booked my hotel in Chicago for my one glorious and hopefully restful night. I just want a nice comfy bed - I'm going to need somewhere soft, big, and horizontal to rest my weary head after 19+ hours of travelling.    V.isa, Please!  So I'm going to practice meditating while at the I.mmi.gration Office tomorrow. I need to finally get my working v.isa aff.ixed in my passport so I can actually get back into Oz in September. It normally takes a good two hours to get anything done there, but I'm going to get there before they open so hopefully the line won't be as bad and I won't get into work too late.  I better bring my notebook - I'm sure there will be some inspiring characters down there!

I don't care - anything to increase my chances of getting that aisle seat  (fingers crossed!) It's 20 hours of flying time, so I'm not too proud to beg! ;-)   Boston Peeps  I will be in Boston on the 3rd and 4th of September - Wed + Thurs. Will ring you guys on Monday. I get in to Hartford/Spfld on Sunday night cause I have to stay over one night in Chicago.    Springfield Peeps  See you soon! :D

        Show me to my bed!  Sooooo, it's after 1.30am, and I'm at work. I swear I am going to leave soon. Don't forget, kiddies,  urlLink FBi Radio  goes on-air today from noon! Yay! And isn't their website lovely? ;-)  I went to a new dentist today and my lord, I have never experienced such a high-tech and instructional dental experience. Digital cameras were used to take 'x-rays' of my mouth, video of what's going on inside my mouth, a refresher course on the proper way to brush and floss, and they pointed out this R2-D2 looking laser thing they use to whiten teeth. Um, is this all knew or have I just been going to hickville Fred Flinstone dentists??? I also learned a lesson in distraction. I have a really tiny mouth and my gag-reflex is pretty sensitive, and when they were taking impressions of my top teeth, I couldn't help it, I started gagging and coughing and I was laying there thinking, "No! I cannot throw up! I must not throw up!" and the dentist was like, "Okay, now lift your right leg, no higher....no, a bit lower, now straighten it more, that's it..." And that helped a lot.  I did start gagging again, so I did the other leg, and that was better. Afterwards I was like, "So what's with the leg thing?" and he was like, "Oh, that's just to distract you from gagging. Cool, huh?" VERY!   So, less than 48 hours till I get on that aeroplane to the States! Have I begun to pack yet? Nope! Not a freaking chance in hell! Looks like someone won't be sleeping much tomorrow night, which is fine, as that  should , in theory, help me sleep on the plane!   Soon I'll be seeing my future husband,   urlLink Jason Mraz  in concert in Boston and I'll be going to see Bruce Springsteen with my Aunt in Connecticut. I hope she screams like a teenager! That would be funny! :-)

        Hello, U.S.A.   I have to make this fairly quick because I've got meatloafing AOL on my computer now to get online, so I know it will be meatloafing up my computer up for years to come and right now it makes my computer crash like every 5 minutes...:-(  So the flight from Sydney to L.A. was okay except for the fact that I wanted to amputate my ass - I'd forgotten how painful it is to just SIT for that long. I had a window seat (not cute, but at least it's much better than a middle!) and I was sitting next to this nice elderly Asian couple who live in Kentucky. I was like, " WHAT? They have Asian people in Kentucky!???" Amazing.  Anyway, the poor old wife sitting next to me, I think she may have had Tourettes or something because she kept doing this odd head/neck/face twitching thing like EVERY five minutes and she'd make this weird sound and then she'd stick her hands/arms up in the air as if to try to stop herself from doing it? It was like she'd have a little fit for 45 seconds, then it would stop. And then 5 minutes later, it would happen all over again. I just acted like I didn't notice anything. That poor woman, my god!  And she was the loudest yawner I've ever heard - she sounded like a cat hissing every time - the poor dear!  I didn't really sleep on the flight - maybe 15 minutes here or there, but I was okay. It was mostly my ass that was the problem. Of course,  I knew I was in trouble when I arrived in L.A. and while walking into Customs, the first thing I see is a big framed picture of the Head Monkey, George 'Dubya'  Bush, smiling his monkey smile at me, the American flag billowing in the background. As if that's the first thing I wanted to see when entering the country! I was already feeling nauseous from the 'joys of being a woman' on the 14 hour flight from Sydney - so I found this extra assaulting!  Anyhoo, I made it to Chicago okay and experienced my first king size bed (awesome!) and my first pathetic attempt at ordering room service (it was probably  the cheapest thing anyone's ordered for room service, ever, but  whatever.) The king size bed rocked, particularly as I knew I'd be sleeping on the same firm single bed I slept on from age 3 to age 18, for the next 3 weeks. Wheeee!   The next day the hotel shuttle took me to the airport to catch a flight to Hartford/Springfield. Of course I got into a fight with the elderly driving me. He asked me where I flew in from yesterday, so we started talking about Australia, politics, then George Bush. He asked me if Australians liked George Bush and I said I could only tell him what my friends thought and that my friends weren't fans of his. He was all shocked and asked if I liked George Bush and I said, "No, I'm not a fan of his at ALL" - the guy swerved the car into the next highway lane and looked at me in the mirror and said, "Um, I wish you hadn't told me that." I was like, "WHY? Are you not going to take me to the airport now???" Of course this guy had a Southern accent, so I should have realised there was an increased chance of him being a Dubya fan. So he asked me why I don't like Bush and I said something like, "Where do I begin?" And I mentioned something about Bush not even actually winning the Presidential election, yet still acting as President and the guy flipped out and was like, "HE DID TOO WIN!" yadda yadda. So we were discussing the Iraq war, and the whole U.N. thang and the mythical  weapons of mass destruction and he was getting all upset at me and kept saying, "I really wish we hadn't started talking about this!" over and over. Oh, the guy actually said he not only supported the war in Iraq, but that he thought George Bush did "what shoulda been done long ago!" OY! When we got to the airport, he looked all sad like a puppy dog and was like, "I REALLY wish we hadn't talked about that. That was ugly. I hope you don't hate me." I was like, "Um, sir, this is AMERICA, right? You are entitled to your opinion, I am entitled to mine! We don't have to agree - it is okay that we don't agree! The fact that we can discuss our opposing view points is great." And he just nodded sadly. JAYSUS! I referred him to "Stupid White Men" by my hero, Michael Moore, but I somehow doubt he'll be stopping by his local bookshop to pick that baby up. ;-)  So, being back in the U.S. is a little weird. I feel a bit like I am in a foreign country.  It's all surreal. Like I know I was just here a year ago, but I feel like I've been away for MUCH longer than that? It is strange hearing only American accents and the weird prices - $1.17, or $2.29 etc, I'm like, "what?" And I've forgotten how impatient some people are here too, but mostly people are just making me laugh so much. The commercials, the signs, the new products, it's all hilarious to me.   It's very good to see my aunts/uncles/cousins/grandparents, even though it's depressing that my adorable 10 year old cousin Jessie (a girl) is up to my chin now! I am so short! I really am the runt in the family - I must have gotten all the recessive 'height' genes  :(   The good news is, I have finally broken 100 pounds!!!! Yay! I'm like 103, around 47 kilos, if my parents' scale is right. I didn't think I'd ever stop being a 98 pound weakling! Okay, I'll shut up about this now - I can hear friends' telling me off in their heads for cheering about gaining weight ;-)  My dad is very insistent that I go in to talk to his co-workers this year because I saw my mother's co-workers last year. Good thing my dad isn't at all competitive! ;-)  Oh, and it gets better - my dad wants me to go say hello to his BARBERS! Um, I have never met these guys before! EVER! But he wants the barbers to meet me because he has told them about me. Do they think I don't exist?   I'm also supposed to meet some 50 year old Israeli guy who works in my mom's building because he is going to New Zealand next month and wants to talk to me about it. So, I'm really 'in demand' - hehe ;-)  My parents are taking me to Foxwoods Casino this Friday night, of course. I'm sure we would have gone gambling already had this not been the first week back at school for kids and too busy a week for my mother.  (She works at the School Department.)  I want to go see the Dr. Seuss Museum again, which is pretty much across the street from my mom's office but she says to be careful because there was a shooting in the grassy area outside the museum, in broad daylight, in the afternoon, about a month ago.  That's a bit freaky. We always had a bit of violence downtown at night every now and then, but it seems as though the people committing  crimes are getting a bit bolder!   I'm going in to Boston for about 2 days to see my beloved future husband  urlLink Jason Mraz  play a gig @ the Roxy and I'll catch up with some friends there, so that should be good. Can't wait!  I've been having a hard time getting online lately. As I mentioned before, AOL keeps crashing my computer and I'm only connecting at about 26bps, which is just so depressing.   Anyhoo, once I get back on a proper sleeping schedule, everything should be smooth sailing. I'm looking forward to seeing buds in Boston, going to eat at all my favourite places in Springfield/Boston, going to see Bruce Springsteen with my Aunt, going to the Big E (Eastern States Exposition - which basically means lots more yummy food) and going shopping at all my favourite thrift stores where all the clothes are super cheap and fit me perfectly ;-).  I'm also looking forward to taking my little grandmother out to lunch at her favourite place next week - I will be pretty much the only person in the restaurant under 75 and they all think I'm 14 and can't believe that I drove my grandmother there all by myself and want to ask "how do your feet reach the pedals?" :-)  And it will be great to see my grandfather too - I like to tell him my crazy stories to get him to laugh. :-)  I've been going through a bunch of old photos and old girlie school notes that I found from grade 5 and 6 and ohmygod was I such a little drama queen! My friends were too! I have so many notes to and from friends about guys that I liked that I knew weren't interested - looks like some things haven't changed THAT much except now I write emails instead of notes! Hehe - just kidding...kinda ;-)  And I think I'm actually much less of a drama queen now (which I know may shock a lot of you!) ;-)  Anyway, everything is surreal, but very entertaining so far!  I'm outtie!  p.s. Apologies for crappy photo quality - once I get my website 'fixed' - I'll post them there.

       p.s. I have a lot of blogging to catch up on, as always. I've been taking notes during my brief holiday with the fam/friends, but I won't be able to post the rest of the stories till I get back to Syd...so, don't worry, Auntie Kate, there will be Bruce Springsteen concert tales coming soon :-D

        San Francisco Treat   Well, here I am in San Francisco, typing this from Javier's adorable iBook in his fantastic apartment with one amazing view. If I didn't love him so much, I'd have to be jealous ;-)  I am zonked. Pulled an all-nighter last night - didn't go to bed at all, and we left a little after 4am to get to the airport in time for my 6am flight.  (I hope my parents aren't cursing me right now - thanks for the lift guys!)   Okay, WHAT is going on with my ass? My ass was killing me even during the 2 hour flight to Chicago! What the hell??? And my ass was dying on the flight from Chicago to San Fran. It hurt like this on the flight over from Syd too but I don't remember it being this bad before. On the way over here, I did not get my aisle seat, but honestly, I didn't even try as I heard the flight agent telling everyone that the flight was packed and I remembered my travel agent mentioning I got the LAST seat on the flight. However, I HAVE to fight for an emergency exit or an aisle seat this time. I have to at least try! As long as I can walk around every hour or so, my ass can make it.  The guy sitting next to me today probably wanted to kill me - I kept fidgeting because I could not find a comfortable position where my ass didn't feel like it was being squeezed to death. I wonder if I have a pinched nerve or something. But it only hurts on the plane! Not when I'm sitting elsewhere. Weird.   Okay, one more thing: airport security. Right, so I understand that I have to take out my laptop every time I go through security at an airport. I understand I have to take off my boots every time too. And my jacket/sweatshirt. It's a bit of a hassle, but hey, if it's going to help avoid people bringing crazy stuff on a plane that could hurt others, fine.  However, I think airports need to just hire some smarter people.  I know there are some very intelligent and competent airport workers out there - but none of them seem to want to talk to me.  I only get the weird ones. As I was getting ready to get in line to go through security/x-rays, I already had my laptop out. The odd woman at the beginning of the line asked to see my boarding pass and passport. She saw the Hartford to Chicago pass and when she saw Chicago to San Fran, a sort of odd shiver went through her.  She looked at me and said in a monotone voice: "You know, Rice-A-Roni is the San Francisco Treat."  I nodded and said, "Errr, yeah...that's what I hear." Then she proceeded to sing the "Rice-A-Roni...the San Francisco Treat" song - in her tone deaf/monotone voice.  I don't think there's ever an appropriate time to torture people with this, but I'm pretty sure that 5.30am is definitely NOT the time to do this. Then she starts telling me that she only buys the flavoured kinds of Rice-A-Roni and starts going on about how the un-flavoured kinds suck and that she'd have to put other spices in it or pour ketchup all over it etc. You could tell that this was something that really bothered her.  Of course, people behind me are getting pissed off because they want to go through security, but this woman starts telling me her favourite kind of flavours of Rice-A-Roni.  I could tell from the get-go that this girl was a bit on the 'the lights are on, but nobody's home' side.  Lord help us - this is part of our 'line of airport defense?'  Unless someone tries to smuggle something illegal in a Rice-A-Roni box, I don't think this woman would notice ;-)

        Home Sweet Home   So, I'm back in my  other  home now, Sydney.  I'd just like to thank the weather-gods for the lovely WARM/hot weather these last couple days. I seriously feel like I've been gone for like 6 months. The 3 weeks at home just FLEW by. I definitely did not have enough time to see everyone and do everything. :( But when I got back here, I felt like 6 months had passed instead of just 3 weeks. WEIRD.  One question I kept getting by friends and family was whether or not I have a boyfriend now. I disappointed everyone as usual when I said, "NUP!" and I kept saying, "Um, yeah, it's safe to say that I'm not staying in Australia for my love life. I'm living in the freaking gay capital of the world." They were like, "Really? Is it really the gay capital of the world? Are you sure you're not just being overly dramatic?"  Well now I have proof!  urlLink Australia 'world's gayest country'   See? I TOLD ya so! ;-)  Anyway, just goes to show that I must really like Sydney as it's not the hot and available straight men that are keeping me around ;-)

        *YAWN* 1am   Just got home from work...wheeeee, I am SO glad to be sitting in my jammies. Have you ever worked on a project, where the longer you spent on it, the more confused you got? Well, that's what tonight was all about. I thought I was losing my mind...and I probably was, but now that I'm home, the sanity is starting to kick back in. It feels nice!  To stay sane, I used that hilarious Dubya link from yesterday as inspiration..we were going through all sorts of crazy site stuff and it got to the point where we just had to concentrate on  the  most important bits and so if we came across something non-crucial we'd quote Dubya and be like, "Do we care? WHATEVER!"  As long as I don't have nightmares about databases, I should sleep well tonight!

        ARRRRRGGGHHH   It is 11pm. I am at work. A file I was working on just crashed. The program said it had saved the file before the 'unrecoverable error' occurred. The program lied.  :p   :-(  Anyhoo, I'm taking that as a sign to go home! But to cheer me up before I go, I'll have another look at my favourite  urlLink Head Monkey,  George (Dubya is for Wanker) . Turn your volume up, gather 'round your friends, family, and co-workers, hell, grab strangers off the street and watch and listen to the whole thing!  (Thanks to Jer for the link!)  Nighty night!

        Slumber Party!   Just a note to any fam or friends who might try to ring me this weekend from the States - don't bother trying my home phone because I won't be there! I'll be spending the weekend 'out west' with Claudine and Miss Mia. Bring on the rented movies, yummy food, gossip, dancing, story telling, facials, make-up etc. Claudine has begged me to let her do my make-up...she mentioned 'eye-lash curler' so I'm slightly frightened. All I wear is lipstick, so it should be an educational weekend in that respect!  Ooooh, we should get some raw cookie dough a la Kristikeet & Lorikeet! :D  Big belated thanks to Brian who is the sweetest thing ever and mailed me a HUGE bag of Hershey's chocolate. Bless you! :D

Congrats, Dad, you are finally as old as Patrick Swayze ;-)   p.s. Would it be rude to be all excited that the Marlins beat the Yankees in the World Series on my dad's birthday when my dad is a huge Yankee's fan? Yeah, I guess it would. Okay, I won't say anything about being excited then ;-)

        Random Updates    Celebrity crush of the week:  Johnny Depp...again. I went to see  Pirates of the Caribbean  last week with Damian and even with gold capped teeth, dreads, dorky beard braids, and too much eye shadow, Johnny Depp was still a sexy thing to watch on the screen. Would have never thought of a flamboyant pirate myself - who knew it would be so funny and keep the movie so entertaining?   Ongoing musical crush:   urlLink Jason Mraz . Yes, I'm sure everyone is sick of hearing me talk about him (or type about him) - but I'm still digging his music and his voice as much as ever - I can't believe I'm not over the CD by now, with the amount of times of listened to it.  So beautiful. I suppose, considering I keep referring to him as my future husband, it is a good sign I am not sick of him yet! ;-)  And can I say that Jason Mraz has lovely fans? I am still getting tons of emails from fans who read my mammoth sized  urlLink  Jason Mraz article  and they're all so nice and kind!  And I just can't believe anyone read the whole thing!   I Gots the Blues...in a good way   On Sunday night I caught up with my friend Michella. We went to go see her husband's blues band play at The Empire Hotel in Annandale. So, I was coming back from the bar with my lemonade and this man stops me and asks if he can read my shirt. I was wearing one of my cute new shirts - this one says, "I'm out of bed, what more do you want?"  It's the sort of shirt I kinda planned on wearing to work every Monday morning @ work as in, "It's Monday, it's before 10am, please don't talk to me!"  Anyway, I stopped so the guy could read it and he started laughing. Then, his friend next to him, who was this older Italian dude said, "I don't read the English very well, can you read it to me?" so I did and he laughed. Then he asked, "So, are you Canadian or American?" Told him I was a Yankee, he asked where, so I said, "Near Boston" and he said, "Oh, I have family there! They love it! And, by the way, do you know you are very pretty???" Hahahahahaha.  I just love old drunk Italian men at pubs. I just gave a quick "thanks!" and skidaddled my way back to Michella who was probably thinking, "I cannot leave her alone for one moment!"  Later on, after the boys played, Michella's husband and their bass player came back to the table and they were kind of looking at me. Finally the husband said, "Lori, we're not looking at your t.its, we're just reading your shirt, I swear." Okay, memo to self: "The 'I'm out of bed' shirt is probably not the best shirt to wear at pubs" ;-)    I Love Me Some 'Queer Eye'   I really am only watching one television show now (since  24 ,  The Practice , and  Sex & the City  are not on at the moment.) So of course I am watching and loving  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy . I have about 50000 gay friends. None of my friends are anything like the Fab Five. If they were, they might be more helpful to me - they might come over to clean and re-do my apartment, for instance. ;-) Kidding, kidding.   My favourite part of last night's show... (remember, we're behind here) and allow me some creative Lori license, so it was something to the effect of:   Fashion Guy:  So who are your fashion idols?  Hot Guy:  I don't know. Tim McGraw? Alan Jackson?  Fashion Guy:  Riiiiiight. So....are these televangelists?  Hot Guy:  (laughing) No. They're country singers.  Fashion Guy:  Right. What about Keanu Reeves?  Hot Guy:  A lot of people say I look like Keanu Reeves.  Grooming Guy:  (glowing) Me too! People tell me I look like Keanu too!  Fashion Guy:   People tell me I look like Ellen DeGeneres.   hahahahahahaha! I laughed so hard I started crying. It was just so random - here the other guys are bragging about being compared to Keanu and the Fashion Dude announces that people tell him he looks like Ellen.  Love it!   Has anyone done any work at work last week or this week?   No, seriously. I don't think anyone I know has. Everyone has been doing the hilariously addictive  urlLink Mini-Pops quiz .  Everyone I know has been calling me or emailing me to ask me the answers. Hehe. I can't remember how many I actually got on my own and then with a friend - in the end there were some we were just never going to get, so I cheated and looked up the snwers so I could get on with my life. However, I am proud to say that I worked on the quiz  after-hours ,  unlike  some  people I know, not that I'm naming names, you all know who you are! Actually, a friend just emailed me to say that everyone at his work was obsessed with it and that the office was quiet until one man yelled out, "I got it! It's Mork & Mindy!" and people burst out into applause! Nice! And much appreciation to the  urlLink cool dude  who actually made all those wonderful graphics.

        Oldies Say the Darndest Things    So, today for lunch, Abby and I made the pilgrimage to our favourite little hole-in-the-wall cafe on Crown Street. We're walking along, and we cut through this tiny park. There's an old woman sitting on a bench, smoking. She calls out to us and at first I think she says, "What planet are you from?" but really she said, "What land are you from?" I immediately get that apprehension of awkward whitey-ness. You know, the nervousness you get when you think you're being asked a sort of trick question and you are worried how to answer because answer (a) will piss off the person asking the question and answer (b) will sort of confirm in the person's mind that not only are you an ass, you are aware that you're an ass. Or something like that. Anyhoo, I got the impression that this question of "What land do you come from?" would lead into a discussion of how the land of Australia was stolen away from the Aborigines and I'm pretty sure there's nothing I could say about this topic to this woman without sounding like an ass. Abby whispers to me, "Say USA."  Yes, she's right, anything but Australia is probably a better answer.   "Um, USA?" I say. The woman looks at me and says, "USA, huh? Well that would explain your buck teeth then, you dog!" She said this as if she would have liked to spit at my feet, but her mouth was probably too try to muster any moisture.   My reaction was to start laughing. I was shocked, but I was laughing my ass off. Abby was stunned too and was like, "GEEZ! What's up her ass???" I kept repeating, "Well that would explain your buck teeth then, you dawwwg!" because it was cracking me up.  Anyway, I did not say anything back to this woman, I just continued walking, and laughing.   Should I have informed her that it is England that is stereotypically known for producing bad teeth, not the US? Maybe I could loan her a copy of Austin Powers.  I admit, I am a bit intrigued by this woman. I am curious if she sits on that bench all day coming up with different insulting zingers, or if she has a few that she just recycles? Would she have been nicer to me if I said I was from Canada, EH? All I know is, if my orthodontist had heard her telling me I have buck teeth, he would have kicked her ass! ;-)  I told a few friends about this incident today and the two best responses were from Gavin and Kristen. Gavin said, "Gee, Lori, I thought you knew by now that that sort of talk is how we welcome our overseas travellers!" hehehe. And Kristen gave THE best and most hilarious response which she may or may not want me to repeat here, so I won't, just in case. But you'll have to trust me that it was a super response. Of course Kristen offerred to come over and put the 'smack-down' on this lady - such a loyal daughter! Cluck! Cluck!  Sweet dreams! -L-DOGG ;-)

        Piatas, baby!   God I love  urlLink Dave Barry . He is my hero.  Check out his wonderful  urlLink Art of piata bashing  piece. I laughed so hard I nearly snorted...and it made me think back fondly to the time my cousins had a piata for someone's birthday and some male cousins were alluding to the fact that I was a) weak b) a girl and c) a weak girl and that I'd never put a dent on the piata. I was like, "oh YEAH? We'll see about that!" And I went nuts with the whacking. Not only did I crack the piata open, it actually went flying across the room. And even more impressive, I must have had a burst of adrenaline when I was swinging because I put a hole in the ceiling. Ooopsies. I was annoyed though because by the time I got the blindfold off, my other cousins had already stuffed most of the candy into their pockets. Bastards. Not that I'm bitter or anything. *flexing big bulging butterfly biceps* :D

        Bye Bye Bush   So, this is a bit overdue, but I forgot to expess my relief that Dubya has left the country. Thank goodness. I spoke to my father last night and he said that he was worried he'd see me on TV protesting against Bush - it was very tempting, I have to admit. So did Dubya bring anymore cowboy boots for Johnny? I didn't read anything about souvenirs from the States. If lil' Johnny thinks he can pull of any cowboys boots for one hot second, he's got another thing coming! Meanwhile, I have been proudly wearing my 'Dubya' (Zero Tolerance for Zero Intelligence) t-shirt.    Bookworm Heaven   I am in bookworm heaven right now. I am slightly alarmed at my book induced ADD at the moment, but I'm still happy. Right now I'm reading  A Few Short Notes on Tropical Butterflies  by John Murray,  How the Mind Works  by Steven Pinker,  Small World: Uncovering Nature's Hidden Networks  by Mark Buchanan, and  Dude, Where's My Country?  by Michael Moore. I've had to put the two other books I was reading on hold for the time being. I am  loving  all four of the above mentioned books and I am finding it very fun and easy to go back and forth and read a chapter of one here, a chapter of another there. And in between reading them, I do some writing exercises. It's been a very inspiring weekend.

        Music festivals, anyone?    Sat - Alive Festival - Wollongong  I'll be spending all day Saturday in Wollongong at the  urlLink Alive Festival . It's free + all ages, featuring 28 Days, After The Fall, and Countersunk, between 1-5pm, so come on down if you can...should be fun...I'm looking forward to seeing the bands, taking photos, etc.    Sun - Newtown Festival - Newtown (doh)  Ah, the good ol' Newtown Festival is here once again! Can't wait to see Craiggles, Sarah Blasko, and a ton of friends that are going to be lurking around at various points during the day...  So I was going to type up a few funny incidents I haven't had time to blog about yet, but my bed is calling me. I'm beat...and since I have to be ready to go at like 9am tomorrow (on a Saturday, sob!) I better get to bed....night!

        Happy Anniversary to Me   Today marks the 4 year anniversary of me living in Australia. FOUR FREAKIN' YEARS. I cannot believe it. It's all gone by so quickly. It's 6 am and I just got home a little while ago from a night out with Chad, Claudine, Amanda, and other gang members. Okay, I was going to write a blog, but now I can't keep my eyes open...good night/good morning whatever!

        I Can't Think of a Title That Won't Sound Idiotic   A good friend of mine just found out tonight that her father was killed.  And I am still amazed that there is nothing to say to someone who's just lost a loved one that doesn't make you sound like a complete asshole.  When something like this happens it's a whole lot of, "Oh my god, I'm so so sorry, I don't know what to say" and the person who is grieving says a lot of "That's okay, thank you."  Sometimes the person who has lost someone actually ends up consoling the person who is trying to console  them , in a "That's okay, don't worry, you don't have to say anything!" sort of way.  There are never going to be any words to make anyone feel all better, not right then, at least.  Not when it's just happened.  And it's so bizarre to think that when someone you love dies, you can't just grieve on your own, you have to plan wakes and funerals and arrangements and cars and readings and gifts and flowers and about a million other little details, not to mention the pain of actually  showing up  and trying not to break down and to listen to person after person tell you how sorry they are for your loss. And how sorry they are they don't know what else to say. And you reassure them that they don't have to say anything.   I think it's really more of a presence that helps. Just knowing that people are there to help you, support you, distract you, hold you, when you are ready.    I thought a lot about my grandfather and my grandmother tonight - the ones who have passed away.  One passed away completely by surprise. The other death we knew was coming. But both losses were completely agonising in their own ways.  I still miss Dziadziu and Grandma heaps, but enough time has passed for the family to heal.  You never forget, but you heal (hopefully). But when it first happens, it's terrifying because then and there, you can't imagine a time where you won't feel completely gutted.   I chatted to my friend for quite a while tonight - god, I just can't imagine having to ring your friends and tell them that your father was killed. It all seems so surreal.  We hear it happening to other people all the time, but we don't expect it to happen to  us  or our friends/family.  All my thoughts and prayers go out to B and her family tonight. I hope they make it through this the best that they can.  These little mortality kicks in the ass.  We ride along, all comfortable, acting like everything's going to always be there. Or, at least I do. I am a big procrastinator. I put lots of things off. I always think, "Doesn't matter, I can do it next week."  But maybe I can't. Or won't. Silly really. One of the reasons why I am obsessed with butterflies and wear so many butterfly things is to remind myself that life is fleeting, fragile, changing, beautiful.  We're not going to be around forever.  Butterflies remind me that life is impermanent. So if I want to do something, I should do it. If I want to tell someone something, I should do it. Today.  Now.    After talking to my friend I had this really overwhelming urge to call my parents and tell them that I love them.  So I did.

        Not quite Rugby...   So, tonight was the Rugby World Cup - Australia vs. England. Australians take their Rugby very seriously. So do the Brits. Lots of testosterone, lots of beer at the pub, team colours, big screen TVs tuned into the game, general craziness. And what did I do? I went to see ballet at the Opera House with Glenn. He's leaving Australia soon and I promised him I'd go see something at the Opera House with him before he left.   So we were laughing as we made our way to the Opera House, all dressed up in black, while everyone else on the bus was in green and gold or red and white.  We looked like the things in those children's books that didn't "belong" in the picture.  Anyway, the ballet was excellent. (We saw the Bella Trilogy.) I don't think I've been to a ballet since I was in high school. Glenn fell asleep during the first two performances, but he was wide awake for the last one. I really enjoyed the first two, but the last one just rocked. (Molto Vivace) It was beautiful and hilarious, with amazing set design, fun costumes, cute moves, lovely Handel music, great humour.   As we were getting up from our seats in the theatre, a little old woman walked by and yelled, "England and Australia are tied at 14!" As we were waiting for our bus we heards lots of cheering and screaming and were like, "CRAP! What is going on??? Who's scoring!???" England won it in the end. Bastards! ;-)  I just bought another book today even though I'm still getting through about 6 others...sigh...my book ADD is out of control...but I love my recent purchase - Amy Tan's  The Opposite of Fate . I was very close to getting Toni Morrison's  Love  or this book called  Seven Degrees of Ambiguity  by Aussie author Elliot Perlman. They both look wonderful, but Amy's won me over today.

        HOT! HOT! HOT!   I know, I know, I keep saying how much I love hot weather, so I really shouldn't complain, but I'm more of a low 30s (celsius)/80s (farenheit) sorta gal. ;-) Gorgeous day today -   clear blue skies and hot in the shade...it's currently 6pm and it's 39 degrees C, or 102.2 degrees F. It is meatloafing HOT! :-D    This morning I went to Rockingham to see dolphins swimming in the wild and it was awesome. We saw heaps - unfortunately my digital camera is really not meant to take pics of moving targets! And my camera has also been misbehaving and it won't always take pics when I want it to - I have to turn if off and on again - I've got a method that works fairly well.  So while my camera is not really meant for action shots, I think a few pics came out ok. I am bummed because all the tours that let you swim with the dolphins are booked until like Jan 13th (and i'm only here until the 31st of Dec) so I had to do the viewing only tour. We were right next to the swimming tour and I was so jealous that they got to swim with the dolphins, but now I know if I ever come back here, I have to book that tour before my plane ticket! ;-) The viewing only tour was still excellent - so relaxing and beautiful. The little girl in me is VERY happy. I started studying dolphins when I was about 8 or 9 and did science projects on how they communicate etc. Before I was obsessed with butterflies, I was obsessed with dolphins and I painted my bedroom in Springfield a pale blue (to supposedly be oceany) and my room is full of dolphin stuff, shells, starfish, sand dollars, etc. And up until I was 19, I was planning to be a marine biologist and a writer.  The writer thing is still happening, but even though I don't want to be a marine biologist anymore (not right now, anyway!) , after seeing the dolphins swimming in the natural homes (and not at Sea World - yay!), it just reminded me why I was so obsessed with them. They're so beautiful, playful, intelligent. I want to study them again - if only in my spare time. So yeah, the morning cruise was fantastic - we saw heaps of dolphins, including a mama dolphin and her calf, teenage dolphins trying to mate (the skipper said that they were too young, but we're trying to have a go anyway - hmmmm, perhaps they have been watching too many Hollywood films or television - even dolphins are having sex earlier these days! Is it peer pressure? ;-) The beaches at Rockhingham are gorgeous - the clearest and prettiest water ever + I would LOVE to go back to Dolphin Bay one day and try swimming there as well -  absolutely breathtaking!  Oh, and the mussels our guide made for us were FABULOUS! The tastiest mussels I've ever had! It was hilarious to watch the little kids competing afterwards, to see who could throw their mussel shell the farthest - and it was cool to be able to throw things out the boat into the ocean, knowing we weren't polluting it ;-)  Oh, and that's another thing why I really dig these Rockingham Dolphin tours - they do not feed the dolphins and it's all very respectful of the dolphins. We're just their to visit. The dolphin swimmers all stuck together in big circles, so they weren't getting carried away, all noisy and all over the place. So yeah, no dolphin bribery - you just turn up where the dolphins normally are, and hope for the best ;-)   I just got back from Subiaco, which is this really cool suburb of Perth...not much was open as it's Boxing Day, but I found a chemist (my allergies are killing me and so I found some new stuff to try for hayfever etc) and the markets were still open and what did I buy? Two bags! I either have backpacks which are too big for just going to the park to do some reading/writing or purses which are too small  - so I got these really cute and cheap bags that are just the right size for me to carry a book, my journal, wallet, sunglasses, keys, etc. My 'writing bags' ;-) The price was definitely right! I kinda ruined my last small backpack at the Homebake festival - it got stepped on and beer poured on it, so I saw these and was like "woo-hoo!" I was going to go to Kings Park after Subiaco - it is supposed to have amazing views of the city/river and I didn't get to go last year, but as I  mentioned, it's currently 39/102 degrees here and I was dying in Subiaco and just got gelato instead of hiking to the Park! When I was walking down the street, in the sun, I kept imagining that I was actually walking on the surface of the sun.   Silly me, for some reason, I was obsessed with finding the Merchant Tea House - I was pretty sure it would not be open, but I just wanted to see where it was in Subiaco and I would get an iced tea or coffee if it was open. Don't ask me why I did not look at the actual address of it - I just looked at the guidebook map which said the corner of these two streets. Well, I just could not find it. I was sweating like a mofo and I was just getting annoyed with myself - I kept walking past the streets before and after the one I was looking for, but could not find the one I wanted! I was like, "is it in another dimension??? Do I have to be a wizard and not a muggle to see it? Is it like the Leaky Cauldron? Am I just a dork?" Finally I checked my book to see if there was an address. There was. So I went to it, STILL did not see the corner street on the map, and just started laughing when I saw that it was totally NOT the Merchant Tea House anymore. It was a closed photo place. I checked the year of my Western Australia Lonely Planet, which I recently bought. 1992. WHAT??? How the hell did I not check that? I was just making fun of Steve in Sydney last week for carrying around a travel book that was a decade old....ooops! Oh well, I was at least able to stop thinking about the stupid tea place and just treated myself to orange and blueberry gelato (2 separate kinds, it's not a new flavour combo.)  Tomorrow I leave for the 4-day Monkey Mia tour. It's the tour I wanted to do last year, but I ran out of time.  Because I'd booked things on certain days and the tour only left on certain days, I couldn't go, so I'm making up for it this year!  Happy Boxing Day!

       p.s. People in Perth are so nice! I already know this, but case in point...basically my hostel was supposed to be closed between 11am-4pm today, just for Xmas, and my flight got in after 10am, so I didn't know if I could check in in time, so the hostel employee emailed me the code to the building and left my key behind a secret spot in the entrance - how sweet is that? Very trusting! They said to just pay for my room when the office hours opened later. As it turned out, I got there in just the nick of time and was able to pay upfront, but my key was already waiting for me in the hiding place. Two thumbs up!!! And more thumbs for the manager who gave me several pieces of Cadbury chocolate! ;-)  So far I am the only one in my dorm room - hope it lasts! ;-)

        MERRY XMAS FROM PERTH   Just a really quick quickie - Perth is sunny and hot - I have just been walking around the city centre (it's a ghost town on Christmas, as I expected) and I ended up walking and reading along the Swan River...very nice and relaxing. I'm going to head to the beach later this arvo and probably stay to catch the sunset...going a bit later to avoid the harshest sun rays - I applied sunscreen like 5000x last year and still got burnt, so I'm trying to at least avoid the worst part of the day, sun-wise.  I am also just trying to stay awake. I did not go to bed last night, for fear that I'd sleep through my alarm, so I'm a zombie now!   The elevator in my building was broken when I went to call it to head down to my taxi which picked me up at 6.30am today. Thank goodness I wasn't IN the elevator when it broke down!!! That would be such a thing that would happen to me, but yay, it didn't! ;-)   I'm staying at a different hostel than last year - it is also fairly run down but it's much more quiet than the last one, only 4 people to a dorm room (yay!), the bathrooms/showers are so much closer to the actual rooms, and the place doesn't smell bad like the last one did. The only drawback is that office hours are only 8am-8pm, and that includes the internet cafe. *pout*  It's okay though because I could always just walk down the street to the last hostel and use their internet access - they're open 24 hours. Not that I intend to be online much, I really enjoy NOT checking the internet/email when I'm on holiday, but since I won't be able to blog while I'm on my  4 day tour, I figured I might as well post something. Besides, I have to check out what music gigs are happening in Perth tonight!  Mwah!

        MERRY CHRISTMAS!   Merry Christmas, gang! Thanks heaps to my family for sending my wonderful Xmas care package! I love everything my parents sent me (they rock!!!) and big thanks to Auntie Kate for the lovely butterfly necklace (I wore it tonight to my Xmas Eve party!) and the pic/frame.  I leave on Christmas Day for Perth - I'll be checking email at the beginning and end of my trip, but there will be 4 days in there that I will be on a tour, so probably won't be able to get online then.   On Boxing Day I'll be going to Rockhingham, which is an hour south of Perth, for what will hopefully be my first viewing of dolphins in the wild.....it's a childhood dream that I am hoping will happen this time around!  Merry Christmas to everyone! I you want to email me, the best address would be:  urlLink butterflynet@ekno.com   Huge thanks to Schmoopie + Anthony for the Christmas Card, I will ring you guys in the New Year, when I get back to Syd!!! Happy holidays, guys!  And thanks to Claud, Fleur, Diane, Lisa, Rachael, etc, for their cards/gifts too! Mwah!  Merry Christmas to Jav - hope you have a wonderful time partying in Springfield ;-) Let me know how long you will be there! (k) x 10000000!  Happy Wedding to Tania & Chris!!!  Merry Christmas to Kristikeet and her lovely mum (not me, her other mum!) - I will call you when I get back! Mwah! Cluck! Cluck!  Merry Christmas to the Sheas, Laczeks, McGuires, Colsons, Cullens!  Love you all! B-fly  p.s. A few of you have reminded me not to get myself  urlLink trapped in a bathroom on a moving boat  again this year - as if I need reminding! Trust me, I never want to do that again!

        I HEART WA!   Wow. Just got back from my 4 Day Tour to Monkey Mia and I just can't get over what an amazing time I had. Our tour guide was wonderful and hilarious and the people on the tour were a lovely bunch. It was a pleasure to hang out with them all these last 4 days. As our bus  drove back into Perth today, it was a shock to the system to see the city. It was a strange sight and my first reaction was, "Man, can't we just go back to where we were?" Who knew that Lori, Little Miss Cityslicker, would adjust so quickly to the country/small town living?   I am too tired to write too much tonight. I have to go put my Nurofen Gel on my poor sore legs now - my legs are sore from the rock climbing we did two days ago (I am in crap shape!)  and I know they'll be feeling the sand dune climbing we did today. I really need to start exercising - I can't expect to be a lazy ass and then not have my muscles rebel when I actually use them -  but yeah - the short  story (which is rare from me) is that I had a brilliant trip and I am so disappointed I don't have more time in Western Australia. I really want to go do the  top  northwest and the bottom southwest of WA! If only I could find someone to sponsor these trips. ;-)  Tomorrow is my last day in WA and then I'm back on a plane to Sydney....I arrive at 7am  on New Year's Day - so I'll be on a plane on New Year's Eve...so no parties for me, but the plane ticket was MUCH cheaper, so it makes sense...maybe they'll give us champagne on the plane! A girl can  dream...  I am now pining away for the small towns/country/farm stay - who knew!??

        HAPPY NEW YEAR! *COUGH COUGH*   Okay, you know, I have to say that 2004 isn't exactly starting out as I was hoping! The end of 2003 was perfect  - relaxing, beautiful, carefree, fun, and exciting. Five days in to 2004 and I've been to see three doctors. :-(  I felt great on New Year's Eve until our plane took off and my ears got really uncomfortable and blocked. And then on New Year's Day, in the evening, I had what 2 out of the 3 doctors is convinced was an asthma attack. It was pretty scary as it was at night, so couldn't go to the doctor and I made myself stay awake all night cause I was worried I might stop breathing or whatever. The first doctor prescribed me an inhaler straight away and looked in my ears and said I had wax in them...so he cleaned out the wax, but I told him my left ear was still blocked and he was like, "Yeah, there's probably water in there" and sent me on my way without saying much about the asthma thing - hello, how can you tell someone they have asthma and not explain anything about it???   So stupid me gets on the internet on Friday to read about asthma - I mostly succeeded in freaking myself out, which is not the best thing when you are already finding it hard to breathe. I did not go to work today as I was still feeling lousy and I decided to go back to the doctor (another one) as my ear is still blocked and I'm still feeling shitty and very  congested. I have a hacking cough and am all phleghmy, but I read on some medical website that a chesty mucousy cough indicates the end of the asthma attack, so that sounded hopeful. But then the doctor told me that I have an upper respiratory infection in addition to water trapped in my middle ear. It was at this point that I wondered if I should still have kids one day as I'm not sure it's fair to pass on my pathetic immune system to my children! ;-)   The first doctor I saw today wants me to use this nasal spray to try to get the water in my middle ear to drain out and said it may take another couple weeks to drain and if not, to come back in. He said to keep taking the asthma inhaler throughout the upper respiratory infection (as I'm more prone to getting another attack while I have this)  and to keep taking it from here on in, 2x a day.   After that I went to see my new friend Kevin, who is also a doctor, and he took the time out to talk to be about asthma etc. and said I should not be so sure it was definitely asthma - it is possible I could have just had an allergic reaction. So who knows - but he gave me some suggestions and everyone is in agreement it is a good idea to keep using the inhaler for now, at least.  Perhaps when I get some medical insurance I can go see an allergy/asthma specialist! Anyway, it was nice to have a doctor take time out to actually talk to me about this stuff, unlike the first doctor in particular, who told me jack sh*t and just handed me a prescription!    Hopefully I can go to work tomorrow, but I'm super tired and if I go in, I will probably take a taxi as I get out of breath just talking, nevermind walking to work. I swear, if the elevator is broken, I am going staight home again! ;-)   I got an email from Naomi - a super nice Japanese girl from my Monkey Mia tour. She sent so many great photos of the Monkey Mia group - I got all nostalgic - back when I was having heaps of fun in WA, and breathing oh so easily!  I also got an email from this very cool German girl from my Perth hostel who I might catch up with next week.   Two other people fom my Monkey Mia tour will be coming to Syd in the next couple weeks too, so we can hopefully catch up and get all nostalgic once again.   Oh, and if anyone out there has ever been through the whole, "Is this asthma? Is it an allergic reaction? What the hell is going on?" thing - please feel free to  urlLink lori@butterflynet.tv let me know if you have any suggestions!

        M.ardi G.ras Update + Summer Don't Go, Please!   Okay, so just a quick update on the National Nine News footage of me carrying the "P.REGNANT L.ESBIANS" sign....several friends did see me...here's what one of them said went down on the news:  ---------  Email from Tam:   "It was so funny - they just showed different footage, and the story was like 'there was everything including politicians, raunchy costumes, and pregnant lesbians' at which point they showed you carrying the sign proudly! :) They actually singled you out as one of the features of the parade!  You looked like you were really proud, with head held high, carrying the sign!  It was priceless!"  ----------  Oh yes, priceless! I was dying of laughter when I got this email from Tam. Too funny.  I am so going to have to try to get a copy of this from Channel 9. Even though I was only on for a 10th of a second, it's just too funny to pass up. It's definitely something entertaining to show the grandkids one day ;-)  Ok and I know it was pretty damn hot today, but it made me happy because I was worried we were going to go into Autumn way too quickly. This past weekend was rainy and cooler and crappy and I was bummed...but it is now after 6pm and it's just over 39 degrees C or 102 degrees F. Should make for quite a sweaty Pilates class tonight - there's no air-con in the school where I am taking the class.  It's only supposed to be in the 70s the rest of the week...I know that's lovely, but I think I'm a low 80s sorta gal!  Oh yes, that's right...I am taking a pilates class and a belly dancing class now...this will be 6th pilates class tonight and my 5th belly dancing class on Thursday...tales of how un-coordinated and inflexible I am coming soon...I may suck but at least I am having fun!

        urlLink    M.ardi G.ras 2004: Is this a sign or what?   One of the most surreal and hilarious nights of my life occurred last night.  I had signed up to march in the Sydney G.ay and L.esbian M.ardi G.ras Parade because a) I thought it would be fun and funny, b) I have stood as close as you can to the parade and the only way to get a better view is to actually be IN the parade, and c) I have so many gay friends, I figured it was about time I show some support and get all dolled up in the process.  I knew it was going to be a rough night when it poured most of the day and didn't seem to be letting up any time soon. I was supposed to meet up with my marching group around 5pm because I was wearing my own costume but I had friends who were going to get there around 3pm because they had to put on their superhero costumes that the crew had made...so at 3pm I was calling them like, "Um, are we allowed to bring umbrellas? Mine has butterflies on it!"  (Thanks, Dad!) Yes, the theme this year was the butterfly, imagine that. I was all prepared for M.ardi G.ras in the b-fly department.   So at 5pm I turn up at the meeting spot, which was at a police station in Sury Hills. I am the only dressed up person there. So it's just me and the cops. Lovely. I felt a tad conspicuous, obviously, and I was trying to look confident, giving off a 'No, I am not a h.ooker, thank you, I am just here for the M.ardi G.ras!" vibe. At least I hope I was.  I started text messaging my friends to make sure I was in the right spot. I was. I was just the only one there. About 20 minutes later I see this cute pair of boys across the street with pink dyed hair, wearing undies decorated with pink and purple feathers, and purple slippers. I waved for them to come over as I was feeling quite silly in my pink spandex outfit amongst all the police officers.  So the boys came over and they were indeed marching in my group, yay! Then my friends arrived looking cute and hilarious in their Superhero costumes (we were marching for equal rights for superannuation) and we took some photos.  They gave everyone ponchos to keep us dry, but the hoods kept flying off and it seemed a bit anti-climactic to have gotten all dressed up only to put on the plastic ponchos - they were clear, but still....  2 and a half hours later, we were actually getting ready to line-up...there were all these signs we were supposed to carry and there was this one sign that no one would go near. 20 minutes later one of the group leaders came up to me and was like, "Would you please do me a big favour and carry a sign?" I said sure....and of course, it was the sign that nobody wanted....the "P.REGNANT L.ESBIANS" sign....of course that is the sign I would get to carry - the one that would give me the most interesting looks. This woman came up to me and said, "Oh honey! Good for you, I marched in the parade last year when I was 8 months pregnant, so good on ya!" Hahahahahaha!   Yeah. Cause I look so p.regnant and all.....I know I ate before the parade, but seriously, unless I was giving birth to a grape or something....there's no way I was looking preggers ;-)   Anyhoo, so yes, I decided it was time to take one for the team and I agreed to carry the sign in the parade. The cute pink haired g.ay boys came up to me all puzzled and were like, "Um, are you actually p.regnant?" I said no. Then they were like, "Um, are you even a l.esbian?" And I said no again. They were laughing, "Talk about false advertising!"  Hahahahaha! Ain't that the truth!   Then a friend and I were asked to help hold the g.ay and l.esbian flag, along with about 12 other people - it was huge and heavy from the rain. So I had my hands/arms full!  We decided to be brave and put down the umbrellas and ponchos and walk in the rain and bear the downpour and the winds. Not that I could have carried an umbrella anyway. I could have used two hands just to hold the sign that kept getting blown around, I got quite the tricep/shoulder works outs from holding the flag and the sign together.   So, the whole experience was hilarious. The crowd was amazing. So psyched and supportive! You'd have thought we were all celebrities the way they were cheering and yelling. I was just relieved that people were there at all. The weather was so crap I was worried no one would come. Obviously there were less people, than usual but there were still heaps of peeps there yelling and waving and taking photos.  It was a great vibe - the crowd definitely rocked, as did all the cool people and great costumes! What was extra hilarious was that people kept yelling out to me and cheering me on..."Go p.regnant l.esbian! WOOOOOOOOOOO! You go, girl!"  and "Yay! P.regnant L.esbian - AHHHHHHHH!"   I kept cracking up! The more people yelled at me, the higher I raised the sign. I had no idea that p.regnant l.esbians would be such a crowd pleaser. It's good to know they have support. You go, girls!  So, we were all proud of ourselves for marching in the cold and the rain - we were shivering and soaked through but when we reached the end, (ahhh, wet spandex!) I was like, "Awwww, that's it?" It was heaps of fun even though my left arm/shoulder hate me today.  :-)   Even funnier is that apparently I made it on the national news this evening, on Channel 9, with my infamous sign. My friend Tam saw it, on the 6 o'clock news, but I missed it.  I'm wondering if anyone else saw...I can imagine pals from Perth to Melbourne going, "Huh...so she did give up on those Sydney boys after all!" ;-)  Anyhoo, mom and dad, just in case you happen to see some photos or video footage, let me clear the record...a) I am not preggers and b) I have not given up on straight men in Sydney yet! ;-)  Happy M.ardi G.ras everyone!   p.s. I covered the face of Superman in there cause I haven't asked him yet if I can put the photo of him on my blog...I think he'll be happy to be in it, but just in case ;-)

        Who Wants to Carry Me To Work Tomorrow?   Wow. Tonight was my last pilates class and the teacher kicked our collective asses...and triceps, and thighs, and hips, and stomach, and you name it. I thanked her for the great class and that I would probably be cursing her tomorrow, but that it's been a very good course.  My whole body feels like a rubber band that's been stretched too much. I was 'feeling the burn' for most of the hour and a half...we had more repititions and harder moves than ever and I didn't think I was going to be able to finish them all, but I refused to give up - yay!  I just hope I can move in time for belly dancing on Thursday. :-)  Nah, seriously, I really hope I can keep up the pilates at home - it's been so good for me.   My last belly dancing class is this week, but I've decided to start going to my teacher's Tuesday class starting next week - even though I'm still pretty terrible, I dig the fact that my teacher is 'the very best.' She's the current national bellydancing champ of Australia! So even if I'm not particulalry good, my teacher is amazing. Watching her dance is inspirational.  The class is a lot of fun and very challenging, so I want to keep it up. And it's nice to know I'm still not afraid to make a fool of myself in public. :-) And now I can now do the baby beginnings of a baby belly roll. I am so excited. Of course you practically need a magnifying glass to see the baby belly roll, but it's there, dammit! ;-)   Sweet Dreams?  Even though 'Sweet Dreams' is my karaoke standard, it certainly isn't what I've been having lately. I've been having more and more nightmares, pretty much every night, many involving some strange man/men chasing me and trying to hurt/kill me and I wake up freaked out and out of breath, hard pounding, etc. I've woken up at *exactly* 4am the last two nights in a row. It's freaking annoying!   You know, I watch the end of 'Bend It Like Beckham' every night just before bed, specifically to try to get my mind focused on the hot Irish coach Joe - in hopes of having a sexy dream starring him - but do I have that? NOPE! It's so not fair!  :-(   If anyone has any suggestions for good bedtime rest and relaxation, please  urlLink let me know .

        The Soup Klutzy   Well Klutzo has struck again. I have just re-won the award for 'Most Ridiculous Person I Know.'  Luckily I do not appear to be a danger to society - only to myself...  So it seemed like a simple plan...all I was going to do was have a bowl of soup for dinner. I even had an 'easy to open' can of soup where you just pull the top off using the tab - no 'dangerous' manual can openers for Klutzo!!! So I'm pulling the top off the can, only it's stuck. So I pull harder and...yes, predictably, the soup goes everywhere I don't want it to go. The soup goes in my hair, all over my top and jeans, on my arms, on my shoes, on the floor, on the walls, and... all over my toilet. Yes, I was opening this can of soup over the sink in the bathroom because my kitchen sink is full of dishes I'm trying to pretend don't need to be washed. Funnily enough, the soup went everywhere except in the sink I was using for potential soup spillage.  But Klutzo does not let the fun stop stop there! Oh no. In the process of yanking offf the soup can top, Klutzo manages to cut her thumb on the lid! Way to go, Klutzo! And no pansy little graze for Klutzo - no, nothing but a deeper cut to really get that blood flowing!   I thought rinsing my hand under cold water would make it feel better, but no, I have not sworn that loudly in ages. Ooops.  After applying several tissue tourniquets, I finally found a band-aid.  Then Neurotic Klutzo kicked in and I started thinking about the last time I had a tetanus shot...I actually asked Heather if I should consider a tetanus shot and she was like, "only if the can was rusty" and I joked, "But the rusty cans are half off at Coles!" Kidding, kidding. There was no rust.   So, after all the hoopla, I had sort of lost my appetite, likely due to the blood, but I figured I should at least try the soup, since I had gone through so much to open the freaking can. And no, for the record, I did not get any blood IN the soup - just on the lid which flew off and hit the bathroom wall.  Of course, to add insult to injury, the soup was not even that good! It was this new Thai Green Curry soup and it was not worth all the trouble of opening it. I should have gotten my favourite 'gourmet' Thai Green Curry soup. It's more expensive, but it's yummy and it comes in a plastic container, so it would be much harder (but not impossible)  for me to injure myself ;-)   So yeah, I'm ridiculous. I'm the only person I know who could draw blood and ponder getting a tetanus shot while trying to make soup.   And for the record...in case you were wondering...Thai Green Curry soup in the hair is NOT a good look! :-)  Ewwww...I just found Thai Green Curry soup on my toothbrush.....that's so not minty fresh!  Sadly, the soup incident was the most eventful part of the weekend. I spent a good chunk of the weekend working, counting votes and updating the Y.outhRock website/photogalleries etc.  Very tame, and no blood involved.   Oh and if anyone was planning to call me on my home phone this week, don't bother. My phone has officially died (at least I think it's for real this time) and I won't have time to buy a new one until next weekend. :-(  Signing off,  The Soup Klutzy

        Just a quickie to confirm I have not actually fallen off the planet   So excited for yet another long weekend. Australia rules! :-)   Going to see Radiohead tonight - yay! I've always wanted to see them live and finally it's gonna happen! I really really hope they play "Let Down" - I think that's my favourite Radiohead song, though it's hard to choose.   Tomorrow I'm going to see "Lost In Translation" - finally. Just when I thought I was the only one I knew who hadn't seen it yet, a friend confessed he had missed it as well, so we're gonna go before the movie stops playing.  Tomorrrow night it's another Big Blue party - a night of dancing to raise money for the Make a Wish Foundation - should be good.   After that - just catching up with friends - I hope to catch up on sleep, writing, and the little domestic issues I've been neglecting like tidying up the apartment and doing laundry.   Well, this has been quite a boring blog. But at least my family will know I am still alive!  Smooches! me

        All Hail to the King   So I was waiting for a fried egg, cheese, and BBQ sauce sandwich at the corner shop on Monday and the place was packed. There was a dad in there with his three kids, who were 10, 8, and 6. They were all having brekkie and were so funny to watch. They all wanted a bit of each other's food and were making deals with each other, i.e. "If you give me 2 more strawberries from your fruit salad, I'll let you have as many bites as you want from my bacon & egg sandwich!"  So cute!  Anyway, the father starts telling this guy at works at the shop that it's the 50th anniversary of Elvis' hit "That's Alright" (or something like that) and starts belting it out, VERY loudly. Everyone in the shop was looking amused or alarmed. It might have been a bit too early in the morning for that much Elvis.   Steve, a guy who works at the shop was like, "Hey, Elvis, Lori is a Yankee! Lori, how was that Elvis impersonation, any good?" and I diplomatically said, "Yup, not bad! Not bad at all!"  I turn around to pay for my sandwich and the Elvis singer comes up behind me and hands me his card. He says, "I'm an Elvis impersonator! I do this for a living!" And sure enough, his card has a photo of him all dolled up as Elvis and says, "The Elvis Experience." Dear lord. I was a bit worried as while I thought he was "not bad" as a dad singing Elvis, I'm not sure how good he is if he's supposed to be an Elvis impersonator. But he obviously loves it and that's the main thing!   I kept his card. It's too funny.  I tried to imagine the kids at school chatting to other kids.   Kid 1: "My dad is a plumber!" Kid 2: "My dad is a mechanic!" Kid 3: "My dad is a doctor!" Kid 4: "My dad is an Elvis impersonator!"  ;-)

        Chillin' in the Gong...   Spent most of today down in Wollongong taking photos for the Uni Games. It was just one of those days....the train was late and stopped several times along the way, so it took a little over two hours to get there.   I'd memorised the sports schedule on the way down and had my itinerary all set up. Unfortunately two of the sports were finished by the time I arrived at 1.30 (even though they were supposed to go until 5pm) so I was only able to cover Badminton, Water polo, and Ultimate Frisbee. I took about 300 photos but alas, digital cameras aren't really meant for action shots so I got a ton of blurry shots. Ooops.   Ah well, what can you do. I'm just happy that I spent so much time in the presence of flying objects and did not get hit in the head once! Yay! Usually flying objects gravitate towards my head, so I got off lucky.   I did some writing on the way back home on the train and this little old man told me he was sure I was going to be a famous writer one day. Oh, if only ;-)

        The Tampon Tale   I meant to blog about this a while ago, but what else is new? ;-)  So, Jorge's parents came to visit him not too long ago and Jorge's mum wanted to know if she could bring me anything. Because I'm a dork, I forgot to say, HERSHEY'S CHOCOLATE!!! Instead, I said, "Tampons!"   Jorge was like, "You want my mother to bring you tampons?" And I said, "Yup!"  So he told me to email him the details. Good lord, and what details they were. Basically, though I have happily adjusted to Australia, a country that has plenty of brands to choose from (as opposed to America, which has 1,232,499 brands of everything to choose from), the one thing that I have to import from America is tampons. I like me some plastic applicators. I do feel bad that I'm destroying the environment, but I do feel that I can be a much pleasant person to the world if I have my plastic applicators. (Note: the tampons here either have NO applicators or cardboard only. Australian women therefore impress me. They're tough!)  Anyhoo, I was hoping for a mixed pack of tampons from the U.S. A pack contains 32 tampons. But Jorge's mother, the brave women she is, she decided to bring me 4 box packs. So that's 128 tampons. So of course, because she is carrying 128 tampons, Jorge's mum gets stopped at L.A. to have her bag searched. Apparently the airport worker searching her bag was a friendly southern black woman. She chit-chatted with Jorge's mum about Australia and how she was only going for 11 days. And then she checked her bag and when she saw all the tampons was like, "Sweet Jesus!" How many tampons do you think you're going to need in 11 days!????"  And Jorge's mum was like, "All of them!"  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! So this woman must think Jorge's mother's got some weird medical condition or something.  Needless to say, I thanked his mother many times for enduring the embarrassment at the airport on my behalf.   So, I ofcourse think this is hilarious, but when I told a friend of mine about it she was like, "Do you know what I think the funniest bit is? That you asked your FRIEND'S MOTHER to bring you tampons!"  I was like, "What?!!! It's a sister-hood thing! Why get embarrassed about tampons? It's not like I asked Jorge's DAD to get me some!"  Besides, I feel that Jorge's mum and I have come full circle. The first time we ever met was at our graduation at Boston Uni and the poor dear started her period and asked me for some tampons. This was the day we met. And did this seem weird? Not at all. I'm telling you, it's a bonding thing amongst women. We all understand.  Okay, that's all for now.  Queer Eye  is starting soon and nothing gets in the way of me and the Fab Five! :-)

        Living Dangerously   Usually I have a great memory for books, authors, CDs, bands....but not today. Even though I spent a half hour laughing my ass off at the bookstore while reading some new book about all sorts of unassuming dangers in life, I can't quite remember the name. Ooops. Anyway, the book highlighted everything from books to TVs to bras, being left-handed, sunscreen, holy water, tables, going on vacation, going to the beauty salon etc being dangerous - telling about injuries and deaths occurring from each "hazard." Basically everything is potentially dangerous and we might as well never leave the house again....oh wait, but THAT's dangerous too! ;-) It was all very tongue-in-cheek - I will have to go back and find out the name. My favourite "danger" though is: Baby Faced Men! DUM DUM DUM! *playing  Jaws  soundtrack*    When I saw the chapter on Baby Faced Men I was like, "uh-oh! But I LOVE baby faced men!" Anyway, according to the book, men who are baby faced or have slightly feminine features (take, Jude Law, for instance) may have an increased tendency to prove themselves as not being so angelic, wholesome, or tame as maybe people like to assume they are. The book says that they may involve themselves in all sorts of unsavory activities and behaviours to show that they can be bad boys, too.   Bummer.  So does that mean that boys that look like bad boys feel compelled to act like good boys? ;-)  Anyway, I don't know what kind of stats we're talking about here, but it IS interesting to think about. It would be funny to go up to baby faced guys and be like, "So, are you a hoodlum, or what?" ;-)  Been doing a LOT of reading lately, as usual...just finished  The Art of Happiness  by Dr. Howard Cutler and the Dalai Lama and  Codes of Love  by Mark Bryan. They really go well with other books I've read recently, particularly  Resilience  by Anne Deveson,  They F*ck You Up  by Oliver James and  The House of Spirits  by Isabel Allende. Non-fiction and fiction all relating to how we've gotten to be who we are and taking responsibility for who we are and what we do now. Yeah, I know, I sound like an Oprah special waiting to happen, but hey. ;-)  Anyway, I don't think I can give up baby faced boys just yet, but I will promise to look out for any criminal or socio-pathic tendencies ;-)

        urlLink    Shopping, Snoozing and Happy Belated Birthday to Me!   So it's a rainy Saturday afternoon, Heather is currently napping on my couch, and I'm about to go do some writing until we head out for dinner at my fave Mexican place, Cafe Pacifico. Mmmmm. Can't wait. I had pseudo-Mexican for lunch (Chilli con carne) but I'm looking forward to the real deal....I'm salivating already....  We went to the Glebe Markets this morning - Heather was ever so impressed that I got out of bed on my own, on a Saturday, at 9am. Even though there were lots of cute butterfly things taunting me at the markets, I showed a lot of restraint and did not actually buy anything. Besides, it's the end of the month, and I'm strapped for cash, as usual, so I have to be good!   urlLink   I know these pics are late, but I've finally uploaded a few photos from my birthday party last month.&nbsp; The first one Gavin took without my knowing, ooops! The second one is of me, Claude and Johnny. The last is of me, Owen, and Mer. Hilarious Retro madness! Never forget that "Walk Like An Egyptian" really is a great song for dancing!    urlLink    I've just been playing Heather some music I'm hoping she'll get into, namely the lovely  urlLink Gelbison  and my amazing future husband,  urlLink Jason Mraz . ;-)   A billion squillion thank-yous to my hero, Stevealicious, for sending me many live Jason Mraz CDs AND a Jason Mraz DVD. Yay! It's like Jason is performing for me in the comfort of my own bedroom every night!

        Death to L.J.H.oo.ker    I have this love/hate relationship with my real estate agents. I love to hate them. ;-)&nbsp; So, I pulled a Stupid Lori Trick today. All was going ok, I actually got up after only hitting the snooze button like 4 times (instead of 10!) and grabbed my purse and ran out the door and just as I was pulling my apartment door shut (and locked) I realised that I did not have my keys. Doh!   And the friend who had my spare keys for the last year just gave them back to me last week because she's moving further away and will no longer be my key keeper.&nbsp; So my spare keys were also  in  my apartment along with my main keys.&nbsp; Doh.   And for some stupid reason I had taken home my  other  spare house keys, which were also, useless to me,  in  my apartment.&nbsp; Doh.   I have never actually done this before - I have never left my apartment without my keys before, in 5 years. Which is pretty surprising, considering what a preoccupied flake I can be.&nbsp; Sure, I did  urlLink accidentally drop my keys down the elevator shaft of my building  a couple years ago, but that could happen to any good klutz! ;-)   To make things extra exciting, my real estate agents are notoriously unreliable, ridiculous, and stupid. It's always a hassle to get them to do anything, including returning a call.&nbsp; And even more exciting is that Heather arrives from Melbourne tonight and was expecting to stay with me, so it was not fun to send her a message this morning going, "Um, don't panic, but I'm currently locked out of my apartment and the real estate agent won't call me back...."   Of course, I couldn't even remember who my main agent was now. It changes all the time. Stupid Melissa is gone, but that does not mean anything. So I got in touch with my main agent, Alex, and he was like, "No problem, let me just make sure we actually have your key here, and I'll call you right back!"   6 hours later, I had still not heard from Alex. I had left 3 messages on his work voicemail and 2 messages on his mobile. Nada! The receptionist wanted to kill me, I'm sure. Every time I kept trying to explain what happened and ask if someone else could just have a quick check on my keys she cut me off and put me through to Alex's voicemail.   At 4.30pm, I gave up and decided to just go over there and try to talk to  someone  in person, thinking I'd be harder to ignore that way.   So I turn up and Alex is gone getting coffee for the office.&nbsp; He comes in the office, hears I'm waiting for him and is all smiley with me when I announce that I am the tenant who has been stalking him all day, since I am locked out of my apartment. He was all, "Oh yeah, I tried to call you several times, but it said you were out of range." I was like, "Really...yeah, cause I was just in Surry Hills all day, you know,  in the city  and then he goes, "I also sent you a text message - did you get that?" Of course I didn't because the bastard  so  did not send me one and he  so  did not call me either.&nbsp; My phone never says I am "out of range" even when I am - it just goes to voicemail. I'm not a "fresh off the boat" American, so obviously Alex didn't know who he was dealing with.&nbsp; He then tried to start flirting and joking with me going, "Oh, it's not that cold today, you could have slept outside!" Ha. Ha. Ha.&nbsp; He was cute, but cute wasn't going to cut it!&nbsp; Idiot! ;-) I decided to keep my snotty comments to myself and instead was sweet as sunshine to my agent. If I ever lock myself out again, I don't really want to make it even harder for myself to get him to actually return my call! :-)   And the best part is, my real estate agent  did not ask me for any ID . I love it! So basically anyone could have pretended to be me and get copies of my keys from this guy!&nbsp; I was like, "Um, don't you need to see some ID?" and he goes, "No, I trust you!" And I was like, "No,  really , check my ID!" so he looked at it and handed it back to me. I said, "Don't I need to leave it here when I take the keys?" and he goes, "Nah, that's alright" and smiles at me.  Dumbass!   I went down the road to make a copy of my keys and I got the sweetest keycutter. He was young and cute and kept winking at me and he actually cared enough to point out that two keys were nearly identical and he offerred to put a cut in one of them so I could tell them apart. What a doll!   So, in typical Lori form, I worried all day about something that turned out just fine in the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I'm going to find out if I can get my keys surgically attached to my body ;-)

        Butterfly Backpackers Fully Booked    Well, once again, my Butterfly Backpackers is open for business...Heather arrives tomorrow and then Kristen arrives on Sunday. This means that there will be a ton of story-telling, chocolate, and  Sex & the City  DVDs.&nbsp; I am very excited to seeing Buttercup and Kristikeet and all the girlie bonding that goes along with it. Kristen is bringing me a shitload of Hershey's chocolate. This makes me very happy. :-)   So I had a very lovely weekend...spent Friday night celebrating Ruth's birthday at the Lord Dudley Hotel in Woollahra and then Carlos and I headed back to the City...it's funny because I was thinking I'd be home in bed by about 12.30am but did not get to bed until about 6am as we went to eat, then went to Stonewall, the Colombian, and back to Stonewall for more dancing. We were thoroughly entertained by the bizarre collection of people at Stonewall. Comedy everywhere! Lots of drag queens-in-training who have a lot of work to do (hint: it's not a good look to have to hike up your pretend cleavage every 5 seconds!) and guys who were sadly dirty dancing with themselves up against a wall.&nbsp; I witnessed the first guy at Stonewall to ever take his shirt off and have patrons actually throw it back  at  him, asking him to put it back on! Heh!   I also got to catch up with Jorge, Kuan, Kevin, and Hussain on the weekend, which was fun except that it was hard to leave the hotel we were at because it was so freaking cold outside. Yes, I know, I am a total wuss.&nbsp; I am no longer a true New England Girl.&nbsp; 22 years of Massachusetts winters are all gone. I've totally gotten used to Sydney winters, and I now find them cold even though they're pathetic compared to what I grew up with.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        She's baaaaaaaa-ack! (Well, almost!)   Welp, Heather has left Sydney and Kristen is just about to arrive. Leaving for the airport soon to get Miss Kristikeet and bring her back to my 1 star motel. :-) Can't believe she was just here 5 months ago - seems a lot longer than that! I'm so glad my 'central-heating' is working again, I was worried that I might get demoted to negative 0.5 star if my boarder shivered all night long! ;-)  So, the freak magnets will be together again within the hour - woo-HOO!  I'm off!!!
