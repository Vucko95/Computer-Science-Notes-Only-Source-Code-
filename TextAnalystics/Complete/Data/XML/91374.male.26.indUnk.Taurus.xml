       Neato thing:  urlLink Search Google Service . With a keystroke combo, you can search selected text in Google; it opens your default browser. Doesn't work in Microsoft apps, but just fine for all Cocoa and some Carbon apps.

       "Uses your 3D hardware for no apparent reason!"
 
I like the way this guy thinks, and I find myself opening  urlLink GLTerm  as often as Terminal for the same tasks. I won't argue the relative merits other than to say that I do fine GLTerm to be much faster but I prefer Andale Mono in Terminal. I think you should try them both out for yourself. GLTerm is shareware, 10 bucks I think.
 
Also, I've discovered a Firewire 2x DVD-R, 1x DVD-RW, and CD-RW for $500USD!! One of these days...

        urlLink Apple's list of OS X software  is pretty darn handy. 
 
I struggle with keeping the AppleScript menulet in the menu bar. It disappears sporadically after a restart. 
 
My toes are cold. Mm.

       Whoa. Blogger struggles with Opera 6 on Win2K. This &lt;textarea&gt; is really small and crammed into the upper left-hand corner of the total available space it ought to be using. Odd.
 
I can't believe myself sometimes. I posted a little while back about commonly used apps under OS X I really like and find interesting and I neglected to mention  Fink . Fink is a Unix-based software porting and packaging engine modeled on Debian GNU/Linux's "apt" package system. Version 0.3.2a just got released recently, with new features and bugfixes, as well as new updated software packages. If you're used to Unix, or want to indulge the anti-social geeky side of your iPersona, check it out.

       For a company that prides itself on an intuitive interface, placing the setting that switches between a standard and a military 24 hour clock under "International" is pretty unintuitive. Especially when that option was under Date & Time in Classic. Grr. 
 
But I quibble. My transition has been rather smooth. Or rather, forced migration. I'm starting to see support and development drop for Classic applications. (Opera's recent release of the  final  version for Classic sounds pretty ominous). 
 
And I'd be all right switching over, except stinky things like this keep popping up: I can't watch my Rushmore DVD on my  urlLink Lombard  because the OS X DVD player doesn't like my old, creaky machine. A development ploy to force me to get a G4 eventually? I wouldn't be surprised if more and more applications will have these kinds of limitations. 
 
But, as my Amazing Internet Machine, it's faaaaaantastic. I agree with Dan that Fire is awesome. Too bad no one talks to me online anymore except Big Brains Jenson.

       Along with dan, I'm posting some of my more used apps under OSX:
 
 urlLink Eudora  is a pretty good alternative to Entourage but it's still in beta.
 
The  urlLink E  language works under OSX now.
 
 urlLink Castle Wolfenstein multiplayer beta2 . This is the bone thrown at us while Windows users get to play the full version.
 
 urlLink Snak:  a pretty damn good irc client.
 
 urlLink HP48:  HP released the ROM to this modern class to the public, and an emulator is available under the GPL
 
 urlLink Omniweb : a good alternative to Internet Exploder
 
 urlLink Quake 3  Both Arena and Team Arena have been played a lot lately. 
 
 urlLink MacMAME  has been giving me lots of trouble but I'm sure things will be fixed soon enough

       Mr. Moniz here,
 
I thought I might mention some apps I've discovered since switching over to OS X that I've been thoroughly enjoying (I'll leave my migration rant for another time).
 
Most recently,  urlLink breve  is a neato-keen donationware Cocoa simulation lab for alife, genetic algorithms, and the like which makes ample and very nice use of OpenGL. It's fully hackable with it's built-in object-oriented simulation language, "steve" (no relation to Mr. Jenson), which takes most of it's cues from Objective C. There's also a plug-in API which you can download if you want to hack breve plug-ins in Objective C itself (with Apple's OS X Developer Tools).
 
And now, in no particular order...
 
 urlLink F-Script  is a neato-keen freeware open source Cocoa scripting environment for OS X that takes it's cues from Smalltalk and array-oriented languages such as APL. It allows you to dynamically design apps using Cocoa objects but through a Smalltalk/APL hybrid scripting language (although, truth be told, it's mostly Smalltalk-ish with bits of APL essence thrown in where it helps out, and since there's no real APL character set nastiness one could even say it's more like bits of  urlLink J  essence). Check out the new FScripter tool as well.
 
 urlLink TeXShop  is a Cocoa TeX/LaTeX editor and previewer that makes use of teTeX and the Quartz DisplayPDF layer to go directly to PDF.
 
 urlLink Fire  is a freeware open source Cocoa multiprotocol client for many instant messaging services including AIM, MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, ICQ, and Jabber.
 
And, finally, for no particular reason,
 
 urlLink Graph-O-Matic  is a shareware Cocoa 2D and 3D graphing calculator by the maker of breve with extensive OpenGL support.

       My biggest complaint about OSX is how often I find myself rebooting: Everytime I play a quick game on MacMAME, I lose my mouse cursor and have to reboot. Also, everytime I play an OpenGL game (like Wolfenstein or Quake3),I have to reboot if I wish to play another OpenGL game else I get an error: "Cannot initialize OpenGL".
 
Mail.app really seems to hate my IMAP server but I get the impression that Mail.app is rapidly changing. Mail.app's IMAP support is pretty young. 
 
XEmacs refuses to read my source as anything but read-only so I use Project Builder's code editor for everything. PB is actually pretty pleasant
and much, much faster than JBuilder ever was for the feature-set I need. I guess that it'll be 3-6 months until a full port of XEmacs 21 is ready
for Aqua.

        urlLink Blosxom  
[pronounced "blossom" or "blogsome"]
is a lightweight (to say the least -- it's &lt;30 lines of code) 
Weblog-in-a-jiffy Perl CGI script for (but in no way limited to) Mac OS X.  
Blosxom simply nabs text documents (written in your text editor of choice)
from a particular directory and displays them (in reverse chronological 
order) as a Weblog.  Simplistic --  but a potentially useful spot of fun 
nevertheless.
 
The idea for Blosxom, while rattling about in my head for some time now,
came to the fore in response to George's 
 urlLink query  regarding the existence of any weblog tool that takes makes use of some of the built-in yummy goodness of OS X.
 
Blosxom version 0+1i is available for  urlLink download  now.  See Blosxom run  urlLink with  or  urlLink without  style.
 
What prescience!  As I write this up, George has  urlLink more to say  on the subject.  George, I guess I hit at least two of the four: Apache Web server, Perl scripting (so it's not AppleScript, oh well).  I might even pose that simple text files are quite the content management system for the vast majority of computer users.  I guess that just leaves XML-RPC and SOAP...

       Once you've got MySQL and php installed you're ready to install  urlLink phpNuke , which is why I bothered mucking about with any of this in the first place. I quickly learned something about phpNuke though: its installation instructions suck. For a *nix newbie they're downright obtuse. Fortunatelly the installation instructions for  urlLink Geeklog  are extremely clear, very step-by-step, and pretty much identical to what you need to do to get phpNuke installed
 
My advice if you're planning to install phpNuke under X: download both  urlLink phpNuke  and  urlLink Geeklog . Use the instructions from Geeklog to install phpNuke. Wash, rinse, repeat.

       Another tool that works extremely nicely with the apps George has listed below is  urlLink MySQL . Mark Liyanage (a remarkably knowledgeable fellow) has written an excellent  urlLink MySQL Installation tutorial . He also has  urlLink installation instructions  for  urlLink php . Once I'd found these docs, it took me all of about 2 hours to install both apps.

       one thing that's got me thinking is how most of the blogging tools and news aggregators out there are reinventing the wheel (or at least reimplementing it). when you look at what we have available on every  urlLink Mac OS X  installation (a  urlLink real web server , choice of  urlLink popular , interoperable  urlLink scripting  frameworks, support for  urlLink XML-RPC  and  urlLink SOAP ) it's interesting that you've got three of the "Big Four Building Blocks of Blogging" built right in. the fourth building block -- content management -- is a tricky one since nothing built-into the OS fits the bill ( urlLink Cocoon  might be  a way to go ). but in the spirit of "Navajo blogging tools" (ie, using all parts of the OS), i can't help wanting to use the blocks that i've already got to do the job.

       Now that's better!  Thank heavens for Unsanity's  urlLink WindowShade X .  While the  urlLink transparancy effect  is a little goofy (I'd actually like it to ignore my clicks until I raise it again), it's somewhat nifty to have my mail floating about, readable but unobtrusive, on the desktop.  I'd quite forgotten how much I used OS &lt; X's window shades.

       here's an update on my quest for an RSS client for  urlLink Mac OS X . 
 
thanks to  urlLink Morbus Iff , i managed to get  urlLink AmphetaDesk  installed and running on Mac OS X. the most difficult part was installing all the prerequisite  urlLink Perl crap , which doesn't go as smoothly on Mac OS X as it does on, say,  urlLink Linux . that's doubly-true if you're Perl-ignorant (hell, Perl-hostile) like me. nevertheless, once all of the plumbing's in place, AmphetaDesk itself is a snap to run. 
 
i whipped up a six-line AppleScript that launches AmphetaDesk from the Script Menu (mmm...scripting Terminal.app), and it takes about 30 seconds poll the 24 feeds i currently have listed (by the way  urlLink FA:OSX  generates a  huge  feed -- i'm seeing every post to the site since Feb 18). AD generates a fairly snappy single web page with your stories grouped by source, and sorted by recency. administration and usage is browser-based so things will be very familiar to  urlLink Radio UserLand  vets. for example, adding and removing sources works much as it does in Radio's news aggregator -- you enter a URL into a form field to add a source; you remove sources from your list by unchecking their checkboxes and submitting the form. of course, since the UI is HTML-based and the incoming RSS feeds are ground through templates, you can customize the look of your news page to meet your needs. one other nifty nicety: you can toggle whether or not clicking on a story opens the URL in a new window. 
 
i'm going to be adding more feeds until AD either a) breaks, or b) i run out of feeds. another issue (for me, anyway) is that i can't see any quick way to set AD to poll the sources at regular intervals -- so far, i've been hiccuping AD to achieve the same effect. but my overall report would be: so far, so good.

       Far from the Cocoa/Carbon religious wars, here a few random command-line things I've picked up recently.
 
 Typing "AppleSystemProfiler" dumps, well, Apple System Profiler data to the console. (If only it had a gratuitous XML output option...) A clever Mac tech I know at an Apple reseller uses this in single-user mode (Cmd-S on startup) to verify RAM upgrades on new systems without getting sucked into Apple's automatic registration app.  If that's just too many letters for you to type, take advantage of command completion:  A (tab) S (tab) (return) 
 Typing ">console" as a username at the login window takes you straight to a full-screen login shell, if for some reason you need to avoid Aqua but don't want to reboot for single-user mode.
 Added to ~/Library/init/tcsh/aliases.mine:  alias here open `pwd` . So now I type "here" in the shell and I get a finder window for the very directory I'm in. Kind of the inverse of the Applescript widget I linked to a few days ago.
 
Also, I want to plug  urlLink LaunchBar  again, since there's a new beta up. This is an elegant, super-intelligent, unobtrusive, way deep, incredibly useful tool. Its keyboard-driven philosophy isn't for everybody, but what is? For me, it obviates the need for all kinds of Dock enhancements, launchers, hotkey utilities, and retro-hacks. I liked it so much I bought it twice.

       from the "My God, What Have I Done?" department, i officially bow out of the PEF/CFM v Mach-O/dyld jihad. 
 
uncle. 
 
it's actually an interesting intellectual exercise for  urlLink Mac OS X  developers: is Apple right when it  urlLink steers  developers towards Mach-O, or is this just another example of the NeXT "reverse takeover"? 
 
 if you care to dig deeper, have a gander at  urlLink this doc  from the  urlLink ADC  for Apple's point of view on the matter.

       so far my search for an RSS client for  urlLink Everybody's Favorite OS  has yielded four suggestions: all for  urlLink AmphetaDesk   (thanks to  urlLink Rogers ,  urlLink Rick , Bill, and Gordon) . the  urlLink one report i've seen  of a Mac OS X installation wasn't completely glowing (the author  urlLink preferred PluckyX ), but i'm going to give it a whirl. perhaps later this evening.

       So, it's been a week, so I decided to install 10.1.3, and it worked fine. Of course, I backed up everything with Retrospect first, but I had no problems. I also haven't found any advantages either, but maybe I will later. The length of the list of things that people reported at Macintouch is still scary, but at least the new complaints have died down a bit....

       i too am in the market for an RSS client for  urlLink Mac OS X . so far,  urlLink Radio UserLand  seems to be the most complete (oh, yeah, it also comes with a blogging tool built on an extensible content management system and  an  urlLink Apache -based   (thanks  urlLink Jim )  web server), but i suffer from an inability to pay for software when the free stuff is  so  close to doing what i want it to do. 
 
i took one look at  urlLink Plucky  and pitched it into the trash -- it's a  urlLink CFM/PEF binary  that'll suffer from performance issues  until such time as  urlLink REALbasic  can spit out Mac OS X-only  urlLink Carbon  apps (ie, Mach-O binaries) like  urlLink CodeWarrior  or  urlLink Project Builder  can.   (what i meant to say is REALbasic rules all -- happy  urlLink Chris ?)  
 
using  urlLink Fink , i installed  urlLink Python  solely for the purpose of using  urlLink Peerkat  (written by our very own  urlLink Rael Dornfest ) but, so far, i have proved too stupid to add my own feeds to the beast -- it's only polling O'Reilly stuff. 
 
i also discovered an  urlLink AppleScript Studio  application in the  urlLink Mutsu AppleScript Studio Repository on SourceForge  called  urlLink RSSX . it doesn't work for me at all, but it's open source (under the BSD license). i'll be digging through the source -- maybe i can learn something. 
 
so, the upshot seems to be that the most complete solution out there is commercial. it's damned frustrating.

       As a long time Unix user who has just taken the OS X plunge (and absolutely loving it), I was quite delighted to discover the "open" application that launches file type viewers from the terminal.  I no longer have to remember that "acroread" is for PDFs, and "xmms" is for MP3s, I just "open" the files and the correct viewer is launched!

        urlLink Plucky  is the most promising RSS reader I've ever seen, and what's more, it'll run under OS8/9 as well as X. The app is a $15 shareware package, with free expansion packs that bring the total number of feeds available up to over 4,000, including a bunch I'd never heard of and am now addicted to. Each feed can get its own regex filter, and an iTunes-style searchbox allows for ad-hoc filtering of fetched results. It's multithreaded. It has smart timeouts. I'm in love. Two major downsides: 
 
1. It's not stable. Once I added a couple hundred feeds to my queue, it began to crash every time I checked feeds. I'm going to experiment with the number of threads it opens and reduce the number of feeds in my queue, see if that helps.
 
2. It's slow, and doesn't make allowances for being slow. Once you've got 4,000+ feeds in your library, opening the feed subscribe/unsubscribe is  really  slow (understandably). However, one way to make allowances for that would be to allow previews of feeds before they're subscribed to, within the preferences dialog. As it stands, you try a feed out by adding it to your queue, refreshing all your feeds, then, if you don't want it, you have to re-open that prefs dialog (zzzzzzz) and remove it. 
 
A couple other UI niceties, like resizable panes, are missing, but I'm sure they'll come into play soon enough. ( Thanks,  urlLink Hen's Teeth ! )

       Paul Krohn on the WELL has discovered an interesting way of recovering 10MB of RAM on his OSX machine: use a TIFF for a background in the Finder. According to his research, JPEG background textures can occupy up to 10MB of RAM. 

 
 Memory usage note: setting a JPEG to be your desktop background can
 consume 10 MB of memory, even if the JPEG itself is smallish (in my
 case, 44 KB). I guess it consumes (screen resolution) x bitdepth bytes.
 
...
 
 Yeah, my testing was empirical: how much less private memory does the
 Finder consume with a solid blue background than it does with a picture
 of Thomas enjoying his lunch?
  
 http://www.daemonize.com/familypics/index.php?bigimage=29
  
 It stands to reason that the entire uncompressed image has to be held
 in memory, otherwise I guess the jpeg would have to be decompressed
 every time part of the desktop was revealed, so that part could hae the
 appropriate part of the image painted in.

       Sometimes you're looking at something in the Finder and realize you need to twiddle it in the shell. One helpful shortcut is to drop the item on an open Terminal window, which types the pathname for you (typically you'd type your command first). You can also use  urlLink Marc Liyanage 's  urlLink  Open Terminal Here Toolbar Script  . Once it's installed in your Finder window toolbar, clicking on it opens Terminal and " cd "s you to the folder (directory) you were viewing.

       For the past year and a bit (or so)  urlLink Slashdot  has been remarkably friendly towards the Mac (something about some influential /.'er's girlfriend being a Mac user, or so the rumours say).

       Since this is a blog for folks new to OSX, here's a bit of sage wisdom: never install an update from Software Update for the first five days it has been available. Over on  urlLink Macintouch , some people are saying that 10.1.3 has crippled their previously-fine systems. There is nothing urgent in 10.1.3, and I would say wait until next Monday, and then only do so after reading some of the other Mac forums.

       "Optimizing System Performance" during software installation usually means prebinding libraries. Mac OS X has a number of ideas as to what a library is, too. There's the standard Unix .so "shared object" dynamic library (what you get when you compile software with dynamicly-linked libraries, also known on Windows as a "DLL"), the NextStep concept of a "bundle", the Mac OS 9 concept of, um, whatever, and so on and so forth.
 
Oh, and just to keep up with the Jones's in OS X (well, Mach/Darwin) systems programming, scripting, and general shell hackery, I give you the new 0.6.0 release of  urlLink scsh . Don't forget to grab and compile the ubiquitously portable and tres cool  urlLink Scheme48  first.

       one small step for  urlLink Mac OS X , one giant leap for Mac OS X users.  urlLink REALbasic  developer James Sentman has released beta 2 of  urlLink acgi dispatcher . now  urlLink Apache  can invoke AppleScripts and Apple Event-aware (i was going to link those, but i got lazy) applications via CGI. bridging Apache and AppleScript is a crucial step for those of us coming from a more traditional Mac OS background: it brings me closer to never having to look at  urlLink Perl  ever again.

        urlLink Kernel Santos gives a Linux perspective on OSX management : "Here's a fast and easy way to get a Linux-ey config running on OS X. First get Fink, then install gnome-bundle, then install sawfish. Then the easy part: copy /usr/X11R6/etc/xinit/xinitrc to ~/.xinitrc. Then take all the muck out from the bottom, it'll try to start twm and a clock and a bunch of xterms, take all that crap out and just put gnome-session. Presto!"

        Image tweakers.  Except for the fact that none will write GIFs (damn you,  urlLink  Unisys ), these three free apps are all nice complements to Preview -- and would make good editors for use with iPhoto too. No pixel-level editing, but lots of useful whole-image transforms.  urlLink ToyViewer  is an updated NeXT app (nice retro icon) that does tone/color/size adjustments etc. and saves in many formats (with some hiccups);  urlLink PixelNhance  won't resize images, but offers a brilliant split-image before/after view;  urlLink Goldberg  offers a slew of image manipulations via QuickTime and can view PDFs and movies.

       Ever have someone goggling your GUI and making fun of your over-icon'd dock?  I sure did.  Cory (last name withheld ;-) pointed, stared, and laughed -- "Holy dock, Batman" or the like -- at my (over)use of the dock as triage for URLs and documents I was reading, writing, or blogging.  piDog's  urlLink DockSwap  to the rescue!  Multiple docks of your choosing and configuration allow for a Default dock, URLs dock, various bits-and-bobs dock, and so forth.  Switch by click-holding the DockSwap icon in your dock or via ctrl-esc key combination.  About the only annoyance is its insistence on maximizing all of my minimized windows upon switch, otherwise it works like a charm.

       A while back I  urlLink found  that iBook was inexplicably grinding to a crawl.  After much ado, I traced the problem to AIM, consistently usurping 67-81% of my CPU -- even when standing dead-still. I fired AIM, replacing it with  urlLink Fire , a kitchen-sink (AIM, ICQ, MSN, Yahoo!, Jabber, IRC) IM client.  But Fire had its own little irritations, not the least of which was inconsistently causing my sound to disappear; Entourage couldn't chime it's little blliiinng when I had mail and Fire itself no longer poo'deep'd when I had an incoming IM.  So I packed up my buddies and moved into  urlLink Adium , a nice clean AIM-alike with optional combo-window holding my buddy list and tabbed individual conversation windows.  Once you replace it's hideous sound-effects with those you know and love from AIM (a setting -- there are many useful settings), I recommend you try the combo window and enjoy!

and, yes, while  urlLink Radio   is  brill (i've never used  urlLink MovableType ), i was looking for something that took advantage of some of the built-in goodness of Mac OS X (ie, Apache, AppleScript, etc). i don't think anything fits that bill exactly quite yet. 

i have visions of an AppleScript-Apache-XML-RPC/SOAP bridge that does two-way translation of Apple Events requests via XML-RPC (like you can do with PHP and  urlLink this  script). web services on/from the Mac OS X desktop.

       At the risk of waxing poetic over something perhaps rather obvious, I still find myself
awed at the nexus OS X provides between eye-soothingly gorgeous GUI and hack-inspiring 
*nix underpinnings.
 
Take my  urlLink blog , for instance.  I blog via 
local  urlLink MovableType  install on my iBook, connected or no.
The next time I dip into flowing IP, the flick of a switch (ok, so a few keystrokes,
password, and flourished &lt;return&gt; or three) and piping-hot content is poured into 
into my publicly available server.  Blog locally, publish globally.
 
And the mind-numbingly simple one-liner (albeit a tad ghastly to the uninitiated upon 
first glance) is:
 
 rsync -t -v -essh -r /Library/WebServer/Documents/ {username}@{hostname}:public_html 
 
Alias that to something sane, drop it into your .tcshrc file, and there you have it... DIY upstreaming.  
Admittedly not elegant as 
 urlLink Radio Userland 's point-and-click simple
 urlLink upstreaming ,
it nevertheless makes you feel warm and fuzzy -- at least about that Terminal app.
 
Of course one can take this to the nth, cron'ing it, checking for updated
content via modification time, attempting an upstream only if you're wired (or pleasantly
untethered, mind you), and wrapping it in the UI GUI goodness of an AppleScript/Aqua
interface.  But don't underestimate the thrill of  % blogsync , especially if 
you've been locked in the candy-coated GUI world of Mac OS

        Solid . Native Carbon port of Emacs 21.1 to OSX. It may not be native XEmacs, but it beats using XEmacs in XDarwin, as I had been doing. You can download a build now from  urlLink http://www.porkrind.org/emacs/index.html  courtesy of david@porkrind.com. It's based off of Andrew Choi's magnificent work to get Mac OS and OSX patches into the main Emacs tree; this is just a handy prebuilt binary until an official one is put up.

       I don't honestly like BBEdit for code editing, it doesn't tab the way I expect a text editor to tab from my years of using XEmacs. XEmacs 19.something
has been ported to OS X but that's older than dirt. Mostly I use Project Builder's code editor for my all my needs (including Blogger), even though it
also doesn't handle tabs the way I expect. It does keep a dropdown menu of symbols for me to browse through which I find super handy and
I never saw BBEdit do. Unfortunately, it doesn't recognize variables in it's symbolizer.
 
Disclaimer: I don't write HTML, which seems to be where BBEdit excels.

       Good tip, Paul! Here's a note I sent to my pal Fred, who was looking for advice on an html editor and wanted to know why he should consider something as feature-rich as BBEdit for such a simple task:
 
Here's why you should use BBEdit:
 
1. You will thank yourself for learning a bull-goose king-hell text editor. Once you've gotten the BBEdit bug, you won't go back. I write *novels* in BBEdit. I edit exported Excel spreadsheets in BBEdit. Its UI is awesome, progressively revealing greater and greater depth as you require it, while presenting a dead-simple initial state for beginners. 
 
2. It's free. BBEdit lite does almost everything BBEdit does, absolutely gratis.
 
3. It's extensible: There's a wealth of excellent BBEdit plugins that operate in both the free and payware version.
 
4. It's independent. BareBones Software is a small shop that makes fantastic software. Once you're ready to pay for it (all of $89 the last time I checked), you'll be supporting a wonderful gang of coders.
 
5. It's an easy entr&eacute;e to powerful computing concepts. BBEdit supports (but doesn't demand) the use of Regular Expressions (grep) in its powerful, multi-file-aware search-and-replace tool, as well as emacs keymappings for editing. The help files are incredible, and will hold your hand as you gradually learn these vital, crossplatform concepts.
 
BBEdit: It Doesn't Suck.

       I can't believe that none of us have thought of this yet. Every operating system needs a really good text editor. Every operating system comes with a barely-passable one. Folks new to the Mac probably have never heard of  urlLink BBEdit . If you want a text editor that does everything for (a) programming, (b) HTML editing, and (c) normal text writing, get BBEdit and never look back. Oh, and their tech support is also wonderful.

       Personally, I'm for the mix of self-contained topical posts and conversational posts. Why not keep everything out in front? Not that QuickTopic isn't nice, but it's another layer to drill down through to get the tasty blog goodness. Or something.
 
On the Perl front, if you're the type who uses a lot of Perl for various things in OSX, you may find  urlLink PerlService  of use. Also by the same author:  urlLink SSHAgentServices and SSHAskPassword . Yay Services! (Now with correct links! Thanks Paul!)

OK, OK, I'm a bit prejudiced: I am a long-time Perl enthusiast and wrote  urlLink Perl For Dummies . But Perl is the easiest-to-learn language for what the vast majority of users want to do, namely to easily work with the contents of files and to easily do Internetish things. It is easier to pick up than AppleScript or, god forbid, LISP.

I heard that you can just double click it to install it, which works, and then trash it, which I can do, but when I restart, it's not there and I have to go through the process again. Is there some place I should stash ScriptMenu.menu, say in a sub-directory of ~/Library?

       here's my first  urlLink Mac OS X  tip (which is being mirrored from my blog  urlLink Radio blogaritaville ). 
a simple, free (as in "free beer") way to reduce Dock clutter and give you quicker access to your apps is to take the "Applications" folder from your Finder directory view and drag it into the your Dock. now you can Control-click, mouse down, or (for multi-button mouse users) right-click on the Applications folder icon in your Dock for access to your applications.

       Apropos of Paul's raves for Retro, a post I recently made to the WELL:
 
Topic 565 [macintosh]:  Backup/restore utilities 
#273 of 282: Sad Mac (doctorow)      Thu Jan 24 '02 (08:46)    27 lines
 
 Well, I did a fantastically stupid thing yesterday. I inadvertently trashed
 my ~/Documents folder. Then I emptied my trash. Lucky for me, the Microsoft
 User Data dir is locked, so only those files and dirs whose name started
 with letters higher than "M" were deleted. I lost a whole ton of very
 important suff, though, including all "W"riting-related documents that I've
 accumulated since 1984.
  
 Lucky for me, I'd done a complete backup with the new Retrospect for OSX
 beta a few days before, when I got on a plane to go to Toronto (I always
 backup before flying; up until now, I've been booting into OS9 to run my
 tape-drive, but this last time, I decided to take a risk and use the OSX
 beta). I had a horrible sinking feeling when I relaized that my only backup
 of all this crucial, vanished data was recorded with an unsupported beta.
  
 However, I am now 3/4 of the way through the restore of the missing files,
 and, woo-hoo, it appears to be working like a charm.
  
 The lessons:
  
 1. I need to figure out how to set the permissions on ~/Documents to make it
 undeletable.
  
 2. Back up more frequently
  
 3. Retrospect Beta for OSX works
  
 I'll post again if the recovery goes blooie.
 

and later:

 
Well, the recovery completed quickly -- about 15 minutes to bring back a gig
 and half of docs. Of the 2000+ files I tried to recover about 100 couldn't
 come back. Unfortunately, Retrospect can't tell me which ones or why.

       I swear, sometimes y'all conspire against me. Here Cory and Chris were, having a nice playful conversation about Mac RAD tools, and I indulged my better side in not joining the fray to rave about Lisp. Then John Wiseman (hi John!) goes and does what I might have done in my younger, more rash days, and emails Cory about Macintosh Common Lisp. Cory mails me and says hey, this is right up your alley! Why don't you blog this? Sigh.
 
Fine. Have it your way.
 
As far as I'm concerned, there is no better (for highly subjective values of "better") programming language on Earth right now than the Lisp family of languages, and in that realm, Macintosh Common Lisp stands out as a beacon of software development tool goodness. An Axis of Perfection, as The Prez might say. I've been waiting forever and a day for Digitool, the makers of MCL, to finally release a native (read: Carbon) version of MCL for OSX but so far, no dice. You can run the latest released version under Classic, but who wants that?  urlLink Digitool  is legendary for being lethargic in updating their website, despite the tens of dozens of screaming Mac and Lisp freaks out there who love their product. And the pricing scheme is a bit goofy, but I can ignore that mostly because the product rocks so hard.
 
On the other hand, some of the principals of Digitool did start up the  urlLink OpenMCL  project back in the Summer of 2001, which lets you run a ported MCL core engine under LinuxPPC. John didn't mention it in his email to Cory, but  urlLink his Lisp Porn website  also mentions the gone-but-not-forgotten Dylan language and IDE as well, which is another killer dev suite spawned from several chief Lisp freaks at CMU and Apple in the early-to-mid-90s. And FWIW, the Project Builder and Interface Builder tools you get for  free  in Apple's Developer Tools kit are evolved versions of the same killer tools from NextStep Developer, as is WebObjects. Who says old technology is no good? I'm looking forward to writing software that'll work on my OSX Pismo PowerBook, my Turbo Color Next slab, and on Linux, BSD, etc. with  urlLink GNUstep .

       For those of you moving to OSX from any non-Mac OS, one of the "well-known secrets" of Mac land is that  urlLink Retrospect  is by far the best backup program ever. (Quite frankly, it's the best one I found for Windows too.) They haven't finished their OSX version because Dantz is  much  pickier about restrotation than other backup systems, and they want to be sure that all the file permission stuff that is new in OSX works.
 
The good news is that you can try out the "preview" of the OSX version. Even if you don't have a removable backup medium, back up over FTP. Macs aren't nearly as disaster-prone as Wintel, but they aren't impervious, either. Download it, learn the interface, practice good backup hygiene.
 
BTW, one complaint that people have about Retrospect is that it is slower than other backup software if you turn verification on. It turns out that is because they do a much more careful verification. Many backup systems just do a checksum of the backed-up files on the backup media; Retrospect actually does a full restore (to a null device) to be sure that the backup medium is actually readable by the restore system. So restoring takes almost as long as backing up, but it prevents nasty surprises later.

       Here's something weird that  I don't really understand. When I leave my OSX
iBook on for an extended period without using it (i.e., overnight), and then
sit back down to use it, it is really sluggish for the first five or ten
minutes. The machine isn't in sleep mode, so there's nothing to wake up from.
There's lots of disk-churn, too. Knowledgeable friends have suggested that the OS is swapping out all the user processes. Anyone know how to force it not to do this?

       Reposted from  urlLink Boing Boing : MSFT patched Office for OSX today, to close a security hole that their own "security" measures created. Office X checks its local area network to see if any other copies with the same serial are running before launching, as a way to force owners to buy licenses for every copy of Office X they use. So far, so good. But as it turns out, malicious users can capture the serials of legit Office copies and broadcast the numbers over the network (or spoof them into your network from outside) and shut down your copy of Office. Copy-prevention: gotta love it.

 
A security vulnerability results because of a flaw in the Network PID Checker. Specifically, the Network PID Checker doesn’t correctly handle a particular type of malformed announcement – receiving one causes the Network PID Checker to fail. When the Network PID fails like this, the Office v. X application will fail as well. If more than one Office v. X application was running when the packet was received, the first application launched during the session would fail. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause other users’ Office applications to fail, with the loss of any unsaved data. An attacker could craft and send this packet to a victim's machine directly, by using the machine's IP address. Or, he could send this same directive to a broadcast and multicast domain and attack all affected machines.

       With Chris's latest post, Forwarding Address: OSX now has its first ever duplicate post! It just so happens that Stacy posted on January 14 about the 24/12 hour display setting being under "International" as well. Some people might see this as a bad thing, but on the contrary: it represents something two people had to find out how to do that should have been easier, and both felt that posting it so other people would know was the appropriate course of action until the problem is fixed. Perhaps this ought to be the beginning of a frequently encountered problems list? Apple, we obviously like your new OS, but, are you listening?

       Since this blog is also for folk coming to OSX from the *nix world, here's one for you. The Terminal program is not nearly as smart as it could be, and Apple doesn't seem to want to make it much better. A great example of this is that Terminal normally doesn't remember the previous layout of terminal windows that you used.
 
I like tall windows; there is no reason to limit windows to 24 rows. Make your default window almost as tall as your screen. Then open another one. Terminal starts the new one slightly down from the first one, with the bottom of the window running off the bottom of the screen. D'oh!
 
Solution: create about five windows all the size and shape and location you want. In the Shell->Save As command, give this set of terminal windows a name (like "five good windows.term"), set "What to Save" as "All Windows", and select the "Open this file when terminal starts up" option. Quit Terminal, and when you start Terminal each time, you'll get your preferred set of terminal windows.
 
Oh, and don't forget fonts. The wrong font can make you go blind. My preference (for a PowerBook screen) is Andale Mono 11 pt. It seems to have the right balance of size and inter-line spacing. I'd be interested to hear if anyone else has a strong preference for something else.

       I was just recently asked: "how do I switch my menubar clock from 24-hour time to 'normal' time?" and I had no idea. So I checked. It turns out that this particular time preference is not under the Date & Time prefs like one might expect but instead one finds it in the International prefs, under the Time tab.
 
Of course.

       Thanks for the intro. More relevant to this blog, I am also a long-time Mac person (bought my first one during the first week they were available in 1984), switched to Windows about five years ago "for business reasons", and then switched back two years ago because the Mac is just a better system. I went to OSX at 10.1. 
 
If you're new to OSX and were running a nifty Finder-replacement under 9.x, you should definitely check out  urlLink SNAX  from Cocoatech. It is very OSX-ish, and it much more useful than the OSX Finder. I still end up doing lots of file munging in Terminal, but I never open Finder windows any more except by accident.

That's when I froze. But I should have mentioned  urlLink OpenTerminal Here , a toolbar applescript that simply opens a new terminal window who's local working directory is the current directory of the front-most Finder window. Which is to say: it opens a terminal to whichever folder you happen to be working in at the time. This saves me more time and effort than I care to imagine.
 
I've gone from not having to use a terminal window ever (in 10 years of Mac computing) to spending almost 3/4 of my working day in one. If you ever use the terminal, get this script and drop it into your toolbar. You'll come to love it too.

       Software Update rocks, but I didn't know about a cool feature of it until, yet again, my uncle recently pointed it out to me. You may notice that if you don't select some packages to update on your system, they'll continue to show up in subsequent package lists when you go to update again. The trick is to select (but not check) the packages you don't want to see and use "Make Inactive" from the Software Update "Update" menu. Using this, I was able to ignore such delights as Traditional Chinese Language Support and friends, preemptively saving myself some space in the process.
 
If, in the future, you want to see those inactive updates again, you can easily select "Show Inactive Updates" from the same menu.

I may also, like my uncle, hate the cutsey title "haxies", but you cannot deny how much these little apps and system mods rock. I'm glad that people are still pumping these sorts of useful little bits out, much as a lot of people did for Mac OS  
On a space reclamation front, I downloaded and fired off  urlLink DeLocalizer  today, which allows you to remove unused localizations from your machine. You could do this with a shell script easily enough, and I remember seeing some posted to places like  urlLink Mac OS X Hints  and the like, but I never got around to grabbing one of them. Besides, what's Quartz for if not good-looking gratuitous GUI interfaces to mundane Unix drudgery? DeLocalizer lets you select the locales and language packs you don't want and scans then cleans your system of those unwanted files. In the current version, it never removes American English, so if that's all you use, just check all and hit clean. I reclaimed over 268 MB of space!

*	3 - Export or append email in tab-text format 
(for this function a freeware FileMaker Pro template is enclosed in EEA X folder)
 
*	Settings 1 produce produce a Finder-structured-folders archive where emails and/or attachments are grouped by day. 
*	Settings 2 produce a long “paper trail” file that can be viewed with a robust text editor like BBEdit, Apple TextEdit or Microsoft Word. 
*	Settings 3 produce a tab-text file that can be imported into computer database programs like Filemaker Pro.

       As soon as I saw the Contacts import for the new iPod update, I immediately wondered why Apple hadn't released a Notes and To-Do version -- simple data-types that should be easy to import. Well, just a couple days later, there are two Cocoa OSX apps that allow you to put unstructured notes into your Contacts folder. Unfortunately, neither is particularily user-friendly; both require that you launch the app, tell it which text you want on the note, hit Save, locate your Contacts folder on your mounted iPod, enter a filename, hit save again. A much better version would be an OSX service or Scriptie that grabs the highlighted text, prompts you for a title and saves the file (giving it a title like "00Note__ , so that all the notes are grouped together at the top of the list). Still, it's quite promising.

       As long as we're talking about browsers:   urlLink Mozilla 0.9.9   has been released.
   
Several of the bugs I had been meaning to submit seem to have been fixed. Mozilla is the browser I use the most, though it ain't pretty and creating new windows can be quite sluggish.  The tabs are addictive -- with a maximized window it's the closest thing we've got to the fullscreen modes mentioned earlier.  (I still have high hopes for the Mozilla-derived  urlLink Chimera  too). And if you want to get pumped up about the significance of Mozilla, read  urlLink Andrew Leonard's new piece in Salon .
 
I've relied on Launchbar for bookmark parsing for the past several months, since I use three or four browsers regularly and Launchbar is capable of scanning all their bookmark files. Now I'm experimenting with a folder-based system (scanned by Launchbar, natch).  Too bad you can't drag a bookmark from the browser toolbar to a folder in the Dock, grr.  (And yes, I know, URL Manager!  I am still in therapy exploring my deep-seated resistance to this program.)

       Speaking of URL Manager, reader Morley Chalmers writes in:
 
I was using OmniWeb, but have switched back to IE for one simple reason --
URL Manager. This handy little tool lets me create and manage bookmarks like
absolutely nothing else I've seen. Alas, the folks at Omniweb have not
enabled their product to work with utilities like URL Manager.

URL Manager lets me save and store bookmarks immediately in the structure
that makes sense to me. For some reason I was never able to get my head
around OmniWeb's approach.

IE, while not outstanding, is nevertheless adequate for the job.
 

For some reason, I never use bookmarks in a browser, I'm more likely to put them in a file or in my blog's sidebar if I visit the site frequently. I guess that comes from switching browsers so frequently throughout the years.

       Following up on yesterday's browser topic, I asked a good friend who is very techy with OSX which browsers he uses. He said IE 85% of the time and  urlLink Mozilla  15% because he likes the Mozilla bookmarks better. So I installed Mozilla and used it for a while. I was unthrilled. I used to be a huge Netscape fan (heck, I wrote  urlLink Netscape for Dummies ), but Mozilla seems like Just Another Browser. It also seems a tad slower than IE, but not by much. At least it worked well for modern web sites (it did CSS a bit better than IE).
 
As for better bookmark keepers, I have to tell my friend about  urlLink URL Manager Pro . It's pricy ($25), but it does everything I want for keeping URLs and making them easy to edit.

Note that during installation it will try to install in the general /Library/PreferencePanes directory by default when it should really be installing in your user /PreferencePanes dir instead. That can be switched during installation.

       Reader Dave Hendler chimes in on OmniWeb issues:
 
OmniWeb is cool.  Being a Cocoa app, you do get the cool anti-aliasing
features of OS X.  And if pages are designed the right way, it probably is
one of the best looking browsers out there.

My major current problem with OmniWeb is its lack of support for Cascading
Style Sheets, one of the more important standards that is doing a lot of
good for the web.  Take a look at my site,  urlLink http://sollaires.net/ , in
OmniWeb, then in IE5, Mozilla, or Opera.  I use CSS for layout that looks
pretty good on most Mac browsers.  Netscape 4 is smart enough to know it
can't do the CSS, so you get a plain page.  OmniWeb, however, tries to do
its own thing which ends up creating a mess you can't read.  It doesn't
admit to not knowing CSS, which creates a problem for us designers and
developers.  So any site that tries to use fairly sophisticated CSS to
control how their site looks end up being terribly munged in OmniWeb even
though they are doing everything in their power, including adhering to
published standards, to make it right.  That's my main beef with OmniWeb.

I do believe it will get better with subsequent releases.  And it does do a
good job with most current sites.  It's real problem is that it isn't yet
forward compatible with where the web _should_ be heading, regardless of
whether it is or not.

So there are my two cents.
 
Thanks Dave!

       Paul and Patrick: I'd be interested in your hyper-critical views of  urlLink OmniWeb . Besides reading blogs, I only use a web browser to search google for papers and information usually contained in mailing lists or really bland barely-HTML pages.  Warning: Editing Blogger templates in OmniWeb is at your own risk. The &lt;$Blogger$&gt; tags get munged. Other than that, I use OmniWeb for an awful lot.

       Patrick is right that this is annoying and a design problem. Windows users are familiar with running applications in full-screen mode, which has none of the problems Patrick describes (but confuses the hell out of users of typical intelligence who can't grok the Alt-Tab idea).
 
The way I reduce the problem in OSX is to put the dock on the top right side of the screen and to size my initial IE window to be about an inch shorter vertically than the screen and about an inch and a half narrower. When I open the second window, it appears diagonally down but not hitting the bottom, and I can open a third window that way as well.
 
I'm interested to hear what other web browsers do. I have avoided Mozilla and Netscape and Opera because they seemed incomplete and slow, but I haven't tested with them in six months. I wanted to like Opera, but there were too many pages it could not render the way the designer intended, and it did SSL miserably. I assume that it is "better" now, but how much better?

       Just to rant a little bit more on OS X window management: I would pay cash money for products that made it less of a pain.  For instance, MSIE invariably responds to "new window" calls by generating a window cascaded diagonally southeast of the existing one, which means I have to grab the mouse  every time  and move the new window upwards so I don't lose its bottom under the Dock. If you need to read a lot of different web pages in quick succession and make heavy use of "Open in New Window," this gets really old.  Computers are supposed to relieve us from having to do the same thing over and over again, even when we're, uh, doing the same thing over and over again.
 
Similarly, I'd like to torpedo MSIE's habit of creating a new empty window to exactly the dimensions of the last window created, which yields really stupid results when the last window was a farking pop-under.
 
Yeah, I know, use Mozilla, and for some things, I do.  But I could list as many window-management eccentricities for any number of Mac programs, Classic and OS X alike.  (Office for OS X is particularly inscrutable in this regard.)  Web browsers tend to highlight these problems because it's in the nature of Web browsing to create a lot of windows in quick succession. Surely I'm not the only user nutty enough to care about this.
 
Paradigm shift: After weeks of shuttling the Dock all over the place and shrinking it down as far as my middle-aged eyes can tolerate (I have "presbyopia," which means my eyes are opposed to rule by bishops), I've suddenly realized that if you just make the damn thing  really big  suddenly you can see beautifully-detailed icons of all your minimized windows, and that moreover in many cases you can watch as processes in those windows go through their paces.  (A minimized Terminal window is particularly nifty in this regard.)  This is actually worth losing screen real-estate for.  Rocking.

       For the sake of migrators missing their favorite app switcher I figured I should post these  Dock tips  while the list is fresh in my mind. Nobody loves the Dock, but you might as well fully use what's there...  (and then you should buy  urlLink LaunchBar )
 
	 
		option-click to hide current app when switching 
	 
		control-click to pull up a menu immediately 
	 
		cmd-click to show item in Finder 
	 
		cmd-option-click to switch and Hide Others 

 cmd-tab cycles forward; cmd-shift-tab cycles backward; then: 
 
	 
		cmd-shift to cycle backward 
	 
		cmd-q to quit selected app without foregrounding 
	 
		cmd-h to hide selected app 
 
 cmd-option-D toggles dock hiding.

       No classic apps in regular use here, either.  I boot Classic occasionally to copy  urlLink one of my VCDs  to my hard drive (using QuickTime Pro), since OS X still won't read VCDs directly.

       I'd love to get multiple desktops for OS X.  There's a Dockletish thing out there--I think it was mentioned earlier on this very page--that sort of emulates the effect by hiding and unhiding apps and sets of apps, but it's not the same.  And it's not really keyboard-operable.  You can't use the keyboard to jump from virtual desktop to virtual desktop, or move windows from one virtual desktop to the next, or make them show up in every desktop.
 
This ability to manage every aspect of every open window from the keyboard--to minimize windows, maximize them, restore them, resize them, move them, maximize them in just one dimension ("maximize vertically"--surprisingly useful), and pop them from one virtual screen to the next--is built into just about every open-source X window manager written by obsessive lunatics and given away for free.  It should be built into this gold-plated and otherwise wonderful implementation of Unix-for-the-desktop as well.  Yes, you can probably do two-thirds of these things from the keyboard, sometimes, if you're willing to hit cmd-F2 and laboriously scroll rightward across the menu bar. But that's silly. And meanwhile, while you can generally minimize a window with cmd-M, is there a similar keystroke for getting that minimized window back up out of the Dock? 
 
I love OS X, but it's kind of pathetic that every so often I find myself starting XDarwin in fullscreen mode just to have another virtual desktop--or firing it up rootlessly just so I can have some xterms I can move around the screen at need, without having to constantly grab the damn mouse.
 
Speaking of rootlessly, I'm a little surprised nobody seems to have mentioned  urlLink OroborosX , an X window manager specifically designed to run rootlessly under OS X.  It's a bit of a CPU hog and it's sufficiently Mac-like to suffer from exactly the keyboard deficiencies I'm griping about above, but for some kinds of work it's exactly the right thing.  Usually, though, I just run icewm.
 
A discussion question, and then I'll stop.  What Classic utilities are you still wedded to, this far along?  (My own submission would be the unkillable Disktop, a ten-year-old copy of which is as solid and useful on this OS X machine as it was on the Mac my wife and I shared ten years ago.)

I've turned off the comments feature since I don't run MT on my public server, but I could just as well have left it on locally and had my public server MT.  All you're doing manually with search-and-replace can be circumvented by configuring MT for your public server.

       i took an extra second or two to take another look at what  urlLink MovableType  produces, and it looks like there  is  a way to get MT to generate "stand-alone" HTML (like  urlLink Blogger  or  urlLink Radio UserLand : if your blog's set to  http://localhost/mt/blog/  you can copy the whole directory (archives and all) out to a different location (say, your "Documents" folder) and do a search-and-replace for the string "http://localhost/mt/blog" (substituting whatever path you want to use on your remote host). re-save the files and upload everything to your remote host. i did all of this manually and used  urlLink BBEdit Lite  for my searching-and-replacing, but no doubt you could use your scripting language of choice to automate the process and run it at regular or event-triggered intervals. 
 
the downside is that anything that relies on any of the MT CGIs won't work (obviously). that, and there's nothing more tedious than having to upload the whole blog to the remote server every time -- some sort of differential upload would be nice. 
 
i also have Rael's blosxom up and running on my PowerBook. it surely must be the lightest-weight blogging tool out there!

       This has potential:  OmniWeb browser windows will show updates even when minimized in the dock. Combined with the "refresh" meta tag this opens the door to all kinds of crude but easy docklets like stock tickers, server monitors, weather icons, etc. Here's a simple  urlLink digital clock in PHP  that demonstrates the concept. Note the use of the title tag to convey mouseover information (the date in this case). Such a fine line between cool and stupid...

       I recently wrote an  urlLink extended rant  about my problems with Entourage and my yearning to switch to a mailer that stores its material in flat text files. Tim McLaughlin wrote in to describe his solution to the problem which involves &lt;geek&gt;running fetchmail on your OS X machine, storing the mail in a store that a local IMAP server can access. That way, you can use  any  email client, point it at your IMAP server on localhost, and away you go. In other words, there are  no  migration issues (modulo address-books) if you want to switch mailers. Lock in? What lock in?&lt;/geek&gt;

       I've never really cared for pine, mutt handles threads and massive mailboxes much better. Plus it's the most standards-compliant email reader on the planet. (according to mutt afficionados) But firing up mutt the first time presents you with a pretty ugly worldview. You need to know how to cobble together a .muttrc. I have one that works very well for me, if somebody wants it, I'll mail it to you.

       Cory's horrible tale is fairly common. In fact, it is more common on Windows machines than it is on OSX because Windows programs use the very-shaky Windows Registry which is easily corrupted and/or overwritten.
 
I use  urlLink Eudora  for my daily mail, and have been using it forever. It is adequate-to-good, and I don't dislike the UI as much as others do. I'm seriously thinking of switching to  urlLink Mulberry  because many of the Mac-using Internet experts I know use it. If you are an IMAP user, Mulberry is considered one of the best, and it's supposed to be just fine with POP as well. I'll do some tesing this month to see if I want to migrate.
For those of you who don't mind text-oriented UIs, you can't go wrong with  urlLink Pine . It is still well-supported (thank you University of Washington!), is very predictable, and handles all the latest protocols.
 
And a hint for everyone: if you have direct control over your mail server, or are friendly with your server administrator, you should be keeping a copy of every piece of email that comes in for you. Simply have the incoming SMTP server save one copy of every message to your archive and another to your "real" mailbox. Disk space is essentially free these days. I get a buttload of mail and more spam than most people, and my archive-of-everything for the past year is about .6 gigabytes, or about $1 worth of hard drive.

       Funny that mailers should come up here today. I went on holidays for a three-day weekend, which meant that I had approximately 300 critical, must-answer mails waiting for me after I got in last night and downloaded my mail (I get about 75 critical mails/day on weekends and about 150 on weekdays; it's kinda gross, actually).
 
So just before I went to bed, I decided to file my sent mail (I file all my mail into 50+ folders, by hand), but there was a weird display-bug, some of the messages weren't showing up. When I tried to select them, Entourage crashed. It did this repeatedly, so I decided to rebuild my mail-database, using the Advanced Rebuild.
 
Now, I have a  lot  of archived messages in Entourage: Over 100,000. My mail-database is edging up on 1.5GB, and a rebuild takes about an hour.  So I went to bed. When I got up this morning, I checked my mail, pruned out 200+ spams, and started to go through the prioritized inboxes (High, Medium, Low, Rock-Bottom) that I use to keep track of what I need to do. 
 
They were empty. Nearly 300 critical messages, vanished. Panic set in.
 
I opened up my Microsoft User Data folder and checked out my Main Identity dir. There was the new database (1.45GB) and my database (which Entourage had backed up to a file called "Old Database") (1.5GB). 50MB of mail was gone. Some of that was reclaimed empty space, but also gone were my 300 messages. 
 
So I did the logical thing. I quit Entourage. I renamed the Database file to "Database.bak" and the Database Cache file to "Database Cache.bak." I renamed Old Database to "Database" and "Old Database Cache" to "Database Cache." I relaunched Entourage.
 
I was looking at the same view I'd seen the last time I'd launched it. My inboxes were empty and the new messages were there. OK, I thought, Entourage is still looking at the rebuilt database and cache. Must be referring to them by alias instead of pathname. Fine. I tarred the rebuilt files, trashed them, and relaunched. 
 
Same goddamned thing. I was definitely looking at the original database file, but all the messages from the night before were gone and all the new messages I'd fetched this morning were there, having magically leapt from one file into another.
 
I started to hyperventilate. I called MSFT support and waited to get it fixed.
 
They couldn't fix it. But the CSR I talked to told me a couple things:
 
 
  If you want to archive 100,000 messages, don't use Entourage. Run Outlook under OS9 (ugh, you're kidding me, right?). Entourage isn't intended for heavy use. 
  The behavior Entourage exhibited is totally inexplicable.
  Before rebuilding a database in Entourage, duplicate your Main Identity dir and throw out the Database Cache file. That way, you can switch between the two spools using "Switch Identity."
  Your most recent messages are the most likely source of sudden corruption in your mail database, and therefore most prone to being deleted during a rebuild
 
The story has a happy ending: After quitting and relaunching Entourage dozens of times, all my missing messages came back. I dragged them to the desktop, switched to the rebuilt database and dragged them back in. 
 
But now I'm thinking that Entourage and me aren't long for this world. I'm thinking I'm going to switch to something like mutt or pine, which store their messages in good, old-fashioned ASCII files. I hate Eudora's UI, but I have a feeling that Eudora can read the mbox files that mutt and pine use, so I can switch to a GUI app when I want to use a windowed mailer instead of a command-line utility. I'll miss some of Entourage's features (especially the automatic linking of messages, threads and address-book records), but my mail is far, far too important to trust to a crash-prone mailer that eats recent messages when it dies.

       Patrick, I downloaded Mozilla 1.0RC1 the other night, tested it for half an hour, and had the exact opposite experience as you did. On my system (600 MHz 14" iBook), IE5 seemed much snappier. If you are using a desktop system, I wonder if the speed of rendering has something to do with the graphics card in the computer (the iBook has a wimpy one) or, God forbid, the L2 cache size (the iBook design has a small L2 cache for some asinine reason).
 
Fortunately, both browsers are free, easy to install, and easy to test against each other.

       For what it's worth, I've been using Mozilla 1.0RC1 for OS X, instead of MSIE, for a few days now, and subjectively it seems snappier.  I had a lot of problems with Mozilla 0.9.9, none of which seem to be happening with one-point-oh.
 
I'm not on the Well any more, but I seem to recall that Our Cory posted a magisterial rant about OS X email-program options over there a few months ago.  I'm sufficiently annoyed with Eudora, and unsure of its future, that I'd like to prod him into doing another such overview.  (Of course, yes, running all kinds of fine Unix character-based email clients is trivial on OS X, and in fact I have mutt working, but I want to know my  click on the bunny  options.)

       Typesetting. Let's talk about typesetting.
 
On Mac OS X, possibly a typesetter's dream OS due to  urlLink Quartz  and the Unix base, I use  urlLink TeXShop ,  urlLink iMacTeX , and  urlLink BibDesk  with the  urlLink TeXLive-teTeX  distribution. 
 
 urlLink TeXShop  and iMacTex are both TeX IDEs (with a TeX aware editor, front end to teTeX, and hooks into DisplayPDF for viewing typeset documents), with  urlLink TeXShop  being further along for my uses, but  urlLink iMacTeX  supports more encodings beyond  urlLink TeXShop 's ISO Latin and Mac OS Roman.  urlLink iMacTeX  is developed by Jerome Laurens, who was a contributor to the  urlLink TeXShop  effort, but decided to split off and pursue a different development path.
 
 urlLink TeXShop , by Richard Koch and Dirk Olmens, is my general TeXery workhorse application on OS X, and it's great. There's not much more to say. Download it and hack TeX  right now! .
 
Why use two different  urlLink TeX  front ends on the same platform? They're both free and good! Why not?
 
 urlLink BibDesk  is a nifty tool from Michael McCracken that allows you to organize and use BibTeX bibliographic databases, and comes in very handy when you want to search a ".bib" database and cite papers.
 
 urlLink TeXLive-teTeX , by Gerben Wierda, combines the TeX program base of  urlLink TeX Live  (the central TeX development system for Unix) with the package and macro support of teTeX, one of the best TeX distributions around. What's more ubercool are the neato OS X installers Gerben has built.
 
You might be wondering what compiler I use for all this. On OS X, there's scant better choice than  urlLink PDFTeX .

       StreamCatcher is a MacOS X utility for storing MP3 streams to disk as MP3 files -- a nice testimonial to the strength of Apple's new Unix underpinnings, as the app consists of nothing more than a GUI built on top of the GNU/Linux utility Streamripper.

       Ogg Vorbis for the Mac.
 
Undoubtedly you're using your Mac to play mp3s but are you aware that there's another compressed audio format available that's free (in all the best of ways) and technically superior to mp3? Its  urlLink Ogg Vorbis  and its making its way onto the Mac, brought to you by the good people at  urlLink Xiph.org .
 
Today the  urlLink QuickTime Components Project  just released the first alpha of their  urlLink Ogg Vorbis QuickTime plugin . Being alpha and all its likely still got some issues but thus far its working well. There are also stand-alone Ogg Vorbis players available for X as well. Check out either of the following:  urlLink Unsanity Echo  or  urlLink Audion .
 
'Course none of this is of any use if you don't have any Ogg Vorbis files, now is it? For that you'll need  urlLink Ogg Drop , a freeware encoder from  urlLink No U-Turn Software . It'll encode your plethora of audio formats into svelt little Vorbis files.
 
I say: here's to making Ogg Vorbis the standard format for digital audio and to doing away with the  urlLink absurd licensing fees  and technical limitations of mp3. Viva Ogg Vorbis!
 
[Side note: while digging out the links for this posting I came across the  urlLink Mac Digital Audio  site. Well worth checking out if this sort of thing tickles your fancy.]

       hmm...nice UI, this  urlLink Blogger Pro .

been a while (and i've had problems of my own w/ urlLink blogaritaville , but i'm back to point out that  urlLink Chimera , a Gecko-based, Cocoa browser is now up to v 0.2. it's a nice lightweight (just a browser, no e-mail, news, or IRC clients, or source editor) alternative to  urlLink Mozilla  and  urlLink Netscape . it's also more  urlLink Mac OS X -like in appearance ( urlLink Aqua  widgets and  urlLink Quartz  rendering, for example).

being v 0.2, plenty of stuff is missing or wobbly (plug-ins aren't fully implemented, pop-up menus in HTML don't work, and it's prone to the odd crash here and there when you fiddle with bookmarks), but the most important thing is the fast, standards-compliant rendering (IMHO).

       Have we covered alternatives to  urlLink sendmail  before?  Hard to say which batch of migrators this is aimed at, since the Unix people probably know how to do this themselves, and the GUI people might not need it or want to mess with it.  But, if you're somewhere in between like me and know just enough to  completely hose your sendmail setup  while playing around, consider taking the opportunity to replace it with, say,  urlLink Postfix  -- "fast, easy to administer, and secure, while at the same time being sendmail compatible enough to not upset existing users." I used the very helpful   urlLink Postfix HowTo from HMUG  ; for configuration and operation tips once it's installed, check out  urlLink Graham Orndorff's article at StepWise .

       An   urlLink AppleWorks 6.2.4   updater is out. Among the minor changes listed is "the ability to read and write Microsoft Word and Excel files," a confusing phrase since this feature is not actually new. However, it does now properly open Office files when they are double-clicked in the Finder, which wasn't the case for me before (despite their having been identified as AppleWorks-owned documents). It also launches much faster than 6.2.2 did for me.

       Like Paul H. I've been looking skeptically at that Macintouch fragmentation report. Certain enlightening messages posted there suggest to me that the fragmentation issue is a bogeyman, born of old-school Mac expertise applied uncritically to OS X. Look through the report for definitive descriptions of performance problems resulting from fragmentation. I couldn't find any.
 
There are definitely some unanswered questions, but IMO the moral at this point is: Let OS X be OS X. (I wouldn't mind seeing Macintouch, which I think is an excellent and highly professional site, display more Unix savvy in their OS X reports.)

       There is a  urlLink 
discussion on disk fragmentation in OSX  over on
 urlLink Macintouch . Some folks
were saying their drives were terribly fragmented, even after installing
a new system on a bare drive; after they defragged with Norton
Speed Disk, everything ran faster.

 
Well, I bought the new Norton Utilities, and I am skeptical. On my
two-year-old system, I had 0.6% fragmentation. So I defragged anyway,
and found a 5%-10% speedup on disk-intensive programs like starting
up Classic mode. Big deal, and certainly not worth the time it took.

A MacStumbler-like tool is just plain handy when trying to get wireless access while your laptop travels with you from work to home to friends' home.  And because of some of the details of my home network (my Netgear RP114 does do TCP port forwarding, but doesn't support loopback) I need to fiddle with my host lookups a little;  Dennis Cox' page was the most straightforward I found on how to "turn on" /etc/hosts.

       The upcoming O'Reilly OSX conference has issued its call for participation -- do you have an OSX tech-topic you want to speak about? I've sat on a number of O'Reilly conference "kitchen cabinets" now, reviewing the proposals that came in, and it's a huge pleasure to see the kinds of creative things people are working in the technology universe. A suggestion: Don't pitch your product; rather, propose a talk that explains your product in a context (i.e., not "Here is my thing, which does stuff," but rather, "Here is some stuff, which is important because of x, y and z. My product coincidentally does stuff." Caveat: for "stuff" do not substitute $BUZZWORD, but rather some real and meaningful aspect of $BUZZWORD, i.e., "Bioinformatics for the consumer generation of evil clones," as oppposed to "Biometrics kick ass, just ask all the empty suits at $MARKET_RESEARCH_FIRM.")

        i can't remember if we've mentioned this one here before, but  urlLink Microsoft Entourage  users have a simple archiving mechanism built into their mail client: create a folder of messages to be archived and drag the folder into your target location in the Finder (or on the desktop -- whatever floats your boat) to create an MBOX file. 

 the archive's easily re-imported into Entourage (into a new folder) with a double-click of the document. you  do  lose some information, though, like links (to contacts or other messages) and the "received" date is reset to the import date (not a problem for me  as i sort by "sent" date). 

 i suppose you could also use a Unix mail reader with your MBOX file, but you'll have to do some twiddling: the line endings are carriage returns rather than linefeeds. i converted the file with  urlLink BBEdit , but there are any number of other ways to skin this cat.

       Looks like this year's Apple World Wide Developer's Confernece was a doozy. Especially interesting is Jaguar/Jagwire, a service that autodetects nearby enabled machines and adds their shared files to your filesystem, so that as you wander into and out of range of your friends, you automatically see their shared directories. Also included: AOL Instant Messenger client, rack-mount servers (!), and major performance improvements (much needed, frankly) in OSX. All coming with OS X.2, coming this summer.

 
"You want computers to discover each other and just share stuff" said Jobs, which will bring Apple into conflict with the RIAA, but will give it a popular USP. Apple actually thought its new AIM-compatible messaging client, based off official AOL-TW, was worth higher billing: as it merited its own press release. Fine though it is, Jagwire's Rendezvous features are ground breaking for any consumer appliance, and a spur to the rest of the industry to make such obvious, end-user functionality so easy.

       For old-school Mac users the process for changing file and folder icons is probably as second-nature as breathing but for new Mac users the concept can be down-right strange (as evinced by the bewildered "you can do that?!?" from my room-mate when I demonstrated the process). So, to those who don't know: yes, you can. You don't have to be stuck with the generic icons your Mac came with.
 
The ability to change the icons of, well, pretty much anything on your Mac that has an icon is one of the great pleasures of owning a Mac. Here's how to do it:
 
 
 Step 1: Get some icons  
Excellent icons abound for the Mac, the advantage of being the platform used by the best artists in the world I suppose. Download and unstuff icons from any of these places:
 
	 urlLink Icon Factory  - icons at their best 
	 urlLink Apple's Icons & Screensavers  section 
	 urlLink Xicons.com  
	 urlLink Icon Master  
 

 Step 2: Applying the icon  
Once you've downloaded and unstuffed the icons select the icon you want to use and Get Info (Cmd-I) on the selected icon file. You'll see the Info window appear and in the upper-left corner of that window, a small representation of the icon.
 
Select the icon in the Info window and Copy (Cmd-C) it.
 
 
Now select the file or folder you want to apply the icon to and Get Info (Cmd-I) on it. Again you'll see the icon in the upper-left corner of that window.
 
 
Select the icon in the Info window and Paste (Cmd-V) the icon you already copied (its now stored on the clipboard) onto it.
 
 
If everything went properly you'll have copied the icon from the icon file to your file or folder. C'est tout.  urlLink Discuss

You'll need to download QuickTime 6 to get the video to play, but if you're into vaporware porn, it's worth it.

       I broke down last night and ordered the new iBook 700 MHz with a 40GB drive. I want to wring every last iota of performance out of the machine that I can, so I'm thinking about creating a  urlLink dedicated swap partition  for the box when I set it up. It looks like this was a good idea about a year ago for the performance-hungry and the cash-strapped, but is that still true today? Will it be true under Jaguar (OS 10.2)? If I've got 640MB of physical RAM, how big should my swap-partition be? Your feedback is appreciated.

       Speaking as a die-hard Linux geek myself, I'm having fun adapting to MacOS X. (I'll be putting my initial experiences
writeup on the web soon.)
 
One of the vital tools any UNIX desktop comes with is a virtual desktop pager.  Space.app  has made huge progress lately, and 
does the job reasonably well. But there's one problem with it; an application's windows all seem to want to occupy the same workspace. Go to a fresh workspace in Space and click on an app in the dock and all its windows decide to relocate into the current workspace. This is less than useful if, like me, you like to have lots of terminal windows open and work with programs UNIX-style, launching them from the command line.
 
Here's another annoyance with the dock: if you're running one copy of an application, there doesn't seem to be any way to fire up another -- because  the dock merges two distinct jobs (tracking processes and providing a launcher for programs), clicking on an app just brings the running instance to the front. 
 
However, you can get round this and run multiple copies of Terminal, or Mozilla, or  the OS/X port of Vim  quite easily by remembering  that an application is actually a directory tree. If you run the binary buried inside it 
in ./Contents/MacOS/ using the shell, it launches a fresh copy of the program. For example, if you've installed Vim in
/Applications/Utilities/vim/Vim.app, you can run multiple fresh copies of it by typing /Applications/Utilities/vim/Vim.app/Contents/MacOS/vim. And each copy has an independent existence as far as the dock -- and Space.app -- are concerned.
 
(Next  step: a simple perl script to search below "/Applications" for each named program, and add their enclosing directory  to your PATH environment variable. Or an applescript  to emulate the Alt-F2 functionality of KDE -- pop up a mini-shell window in which to type a command, then remove after you hit return.)

       &gt;Anyone else experiencing this?
 
Not me. In fact, I find IE 5.1 to be quite stable. But this goes to show that experiences vary widely. Cory sez that Mozilla is wonderfully fast for him and he never wants to see IE again; I find Mozilla 1.0 noticibly slow both in starting and in displaying long pages, which is why I stay with IE. I suspect that this difference in speed and stability we are all finding must be due to something else, although I haven't the faintest idea what it might be.

       Internet Explorer (5.1 and now 5.2) appears to have become rather unstable since my upgrade to 10.1.5.  Closing an IE5 window every so often -- and this doesn't appear related in any way to Window contents, number of windows, or whatnot -- blows up the whole app.  This isn't localized to only one machine; both my iMac and iBook have suffered the same bug since upgrading.  Anyone else experiencing this?

       Microsoft just released the 5.2 updater for Internet Explorer for OS X -- weirdly, there hasn't been any fanfare about this release, and there're precious few notes on it, other than:

 
This latest version — version 5.2 — provides all the latest security and performance enhancements for Internet Explorer 5 for Mac OS X and a new home page — www.msn.com — for Internet Explorer. It also provides support for the new Quartz text smoothing feature provided in Mac OS X version 10.1.5 and later, so text on your screen is easier to read.
 

 Update : Just ran the installer. It makes you quit out of all your other apps before it'll run. Hellooooo? This is Unix! Jesus. The installer overwrites your preset homepage with MSN. Argh. The actual app is not visibly faster or more stable than 5.1 was and the Quartz support is no better than I'm getting with Silk. 
 
I've gone back to Mozilla, which is not without its failings (I hate the download manager, and the inability to specify that links from other apps should open in new tabs, not new windows is a pain), but which is far more stable and far faster than Explorer.

       OpenOffice, the free software/open source successor to Sun's Star Office, has shipped for  Mac OS X. It's just a developer build, and you need to install XFree86 to get it to run, but it  is  a free-as-in-speech/free-as-in-beer alternative to MSFT Office. OpenOffice reads and writes Microsoft Office files, including most of the complex ones (you can use OpenOffice to exchange revision-marked documents with Word users, for example). 
 
It's butt-ugly and a pain in the ass to install, but both of those are temporary conditions. The OpenOffice Mac OS X hackers are promising to build an Aqua version of the software for 1.0, which'll increase the ease of installation and the aesthetic pain considerably. Can't wait.
 
Meantime, Open Office 1.0 is available for most Linuxes and other Unix flavors -- enjoy the freedom!

       From Keith Bostic at Sleepycat via Paul Hoffman.
  
"Berkeley DB licensing requires that the application using it be
freely redistributable.  In this case, MySQL, and since MySQL is
covered by the GPL, OS X would be welcome to drop MySQL + DB on
their distribution."

       MySQL happens to wrap Sleepycat BerkeleyDB files now, and I don't think Apple can't distribute that in OS X (since it's a commercial OS) without paying the $25,000 commercial distribution fee. Maybe they could get away with it if they packaged it in Darwin.

       I've been using SpamAssassin for a week or so, ever since the WELL switched it on on their mail-servers. It is  fantastic . I get in excess of 1,000 emails every day, and more than half are spam, and SpamAssassin just  nails  'em. I get one or two false-positives a day, tops, and only two or three false negs. It's made my life livable again.
 
But what do you do if you don't run your own mailserver? Well, if you're running OS X, you can install SpamAssassin locally and have it prune your mail on your own computer. Ben "Movable Type" Trott has written an excellent tutorial on running SpamAssassin under OS X.

       If you've got a dodgy Office.X serial number and you're thinking about running the Office Update, think again. MSFT's latest updater has a blacklist of Internet-circulated serialz and running it  urlLink will kill your copy . While I understand why MSFT is doing this, I have to wonder if they understand the potential downside, which ReplayTV recently experienced, namely, if your software has a means of using an updater to shut down itself, some court may some day order you to make use of such a facility take down your legit customers. Also, knowing that this facility exists makes me leery of updating my copy -- I'm on the road in London, and my copy is serialized with a number that I got when I reviewed Office for Wired. If I get shut down, I'm screwed till I get back to San Francisco.

       You can lock files in OS X like you can in OS 9 and before. The "trick" here is that OS X uses the   uchg  flag to do this. The upshot of this is that the file might look like a regular file in the Terminal window, but you (even as root) can't delete it. You can, of course, use the Finder's Get Info command, or if you want to stay in the Terminal, use the  chflags   command. To see if any files have any of those special flags turned on, use   ls -o  . (Thank you Patrik for the answer on this one for me!)

        I've concluded that I can live without virtual desktops if I have some way
to switch apps from the keyboard.  Quickeys  is the canonical
way to do that on Apple systems, and they have a nice MacOS X port these days.
Eighty dollars for yet another basic OS extension is a bit beyond my budget
though. The shareware app  urlLink Keyboard
Maestro  does much of what I need, and has stuff like a Windows-style
Alt-Tab selector (by app, not document window, sorry) and multiple-clipboard
handler in the licensed version. The lite version of it (what you get if you
don't pay the measly $20) does pretty much everything I need, so I'm sticking
with that.

       More on bluetooth, mobile phones, and iBooks:
 
Although the D-Link bluetooth/USB adapter remains vapourware, there's an alternative available from Mitsumi, the 
WIF-0402C. This is a USB/Bluetooth adapter, and I've seen multiple reports that it works fine with MacOS X 10.1.5 and the Apple bluetooth drivers. The sole distributor in the UK is  Flint electronics , who sell them for £75 +VAT (and delivery at £6.00). They don't have an online shopping system at their website, but the email enquiry form will get a prompt response and they're happy to take credit card orders.
  
I haven't bought one; the reason is that I already have a serial data cable for my Ericsson T39m. So I bought myself a Keyspan high-speed USB to serial adapter.USA-19QW. This beast is reported to work with Linux using the usb-serial driver, and with Keyspan's own drivers for MacOS X 10.1.3+ it works fine. The serial device shows up as /dev/tty.KeyUSA19QW11.1, and Network setup is happy to talk to the T39m over it and configure it as an internet connection device. 
  
(Now to try out the pilot-link tools, which can be coerced into building on MacOS X by changing a single line, and see if I can get my iBook to talk to my Palm m505 over a serial connection -- allowing me to write scripted Palm backup sessions. More on this when I get some results ...)

       To chime in on the virtual desktop debate: I was a heavy virtual desktop user on linux for 8 years. I usually had between 10 and 15 workspaces. My only real criteria for using a window manager was how well I liked it's virtual desktop management style. On those rare times where I had to use Windows, I would get out the old copy of Amish Desktop for Windows 3.0 (that's right) and get my precious, precious workspaces back.
  
But after spending a few days using the Dock, I stopped craving workspaces at all. Since then, I've preferred the dock over the virtual desktop.
  
I'm not preaching here, different styles work for different work habits and I've found life with the dock pretty enjoyable.

       OK, it is probably safe and good to upgrade to IE 5.2 for OSX. Microsoft released it last week, and there were many screams from users because it changed the home page to MSN for some people. I did the install on two different systems just now, and it changed the homepage to MSN on one of them. I attribute this to lameness, not maliciousness, but it is still dumb on their part. "Oh, gee, now I see the light and I want to use MSN as my home page." Yeah, right.
 
Anyhow, the new browser is more stable than the old one for displaying some "tricky" pages, at least for me. I can almost hear Cory screaming now, so let me emphasize that YMMV.

        Well, it's day four of messing around with Loaner - Cory's old 466 ibook he
lent me on Independence Day. I was keen to poke around with the development
side of MacOS X, so I bought me a copy of Garfinkel and Mahoney's  Building Cocoa
Applications  on Saturday, and got to work. Inconclusive conclusions so
far: 
 Things I like
 
 That the development tools and docs are gratis these days. Yay!
 The old  urlLink Project
Builder/Interface Builder  stuff is great, in a weird mid-nineties timewarp
kind of way. What all the NeXT addicts endlessly go on about is true: it's a
breeze to get up to speed. I managed to get my  first dumb
application  up and
running by Sunday afternoon, and that's with no knowledge of Objective C,
precious little remembrance of C, no clue about AppKit - and not  too 
much blind clicking on buttons. Gads, I'm almost looking forward to grokking
AppleScript.
 The built-in  urlLink WebDAV
support  (in Finder's "Connect to Server") is cool. I can already see some
applications for that.
 the fact I can run all this on a 466 256KB iBook without strain.
  urlLink Fink . Natch. What can I say? I'm a Debian boy at heart.
 
 
 Things I'd do differently (given I'm such a darn free software wonk):
 
 I think there should be an officially supported "Source" folder in the app
bundle. Apple's talked about encouraging open source, and having this as an
option would make sharing source on the MacOS a breeze. You could stash the
code for GPL'd or BSD'd software inside, and still be able to hand people a
single application file. It'd turn app binaries into little Kinder Eggs of
source. And  somebody could sell a shareware utility called
SuperAppCompressorDeluxe which deleted that directory from all your apps, and
charge $14.95 for it.
 It's a damn shame that the NIB format is a proprietary binary affair.
Having non-text bits of a development project is nasty - it makes archiving
and oversight much harder, ties you down to one development environment, and
scares the horses.
 
 
 
Things that, after all these years, remind me I'm back in Macland
 
 Dozens of open applications, before I remember command-Q
 Dreaming of a keyboard shortcut for "Hide Others"
 Took me five days, but I still found myself messing around with File and
Creator Types. Thank goodness  Quick Change  kept up
with the times.

       Anyone seen one of the much-ballyhooed Bluetooth/USB dongles yet?
 
According to MacUser (a UK magazine) D-Link are having major production difficulties caused  by a component shortage and quality control issues, and Apple have indefinitely postponed production. If true, this is a real downer -- 
I've got a Bluetooth phone with GPRS -- an Ericsson T29m -- and I'm really looking forward to having wireless access everywhere from my  iBook. But I haven't seen any confirmation of this rumour from elsewhere -- does anyone know the truth of the  matter? 
 
And are there any other Bluetooth solutions suitable for a dual-USB iBook out there?
 
(In the meantime, Ericsson do a serial data cable that works with the T29m, and I'm going to do some serious experimenting with a USB to serial adapter as soon as it arrives. It's kludgy, but for the time being it may be the only workable solution to long-range wireless on an iBook.)

        Could it be that Internet Explorer is not entirely stable under 10.2?  I'd heard the stories of IE crashes since the 10.0 days and I never really had any empirical evidence of my own.  IE under 10.1.x crashed on me  once .  In less than two weeks of using 10.2 IE has crashed on me  three  times already.  It's not Java related and I can't replicate it.  It seems to happen randomly, although deep down I know it's not random, it's just that I haven't figured out how to narrow it down properly yet.  Hopefully this will be one of the things addressed in the much talked about 10.2 point-release, or maybe even an IE update.
 
 
Now, before the chants and cries of  "Use  urlLink Mozilla  you fool!"  arise from the crowd, let me just say that I'm a web developer and I have to look at everything I do in every browser I can get my hands on.  It's just part of my job, it's not a product endorsement ;-)

       Cory's string copying from mail.app is true - I always get an ? added to the start of a string. It's annoying, to say the least. I'm also having issues burning CD-RWs from finder. What exactly is Error Code 6? Hmmm

       The new Mail.app has a lot to recommend it, but I've got two annoyances, one major, one minor:
 
Major: The Junk Mail filter does not work for me at all. After training it on circa 2,000 pieces of spam, it only snags about one message in three hundred and about 90 percent of those are false positives. 
 
Minor: If you copy a string from an email message to your clipboard and paste it into a text editor, you get a mystery nonprinting character at the start of the string. This is especially annoying when copying an URL, since the nonprinting character before the http:// breaks the URL if you paste it into the location bar of a browser or use it with wget or curl -- you have to paste the string into a text-editor and remove the special character before proceeding.

       Like Steve, below, I've also upgraded to Jaguar, but unlike Steve, my upgrade didn't break anything. In fact, it's altogether much faster, better looking, and generally more scrumptious than before. (Which is somewhat upsetting: as every day was like Christmas anyway, but finding all the new little details in Jaguar makes me worry for my sanity.)

My current obsession: finding thumbnail pictures of everyone in my address book: the way they appear in mail.app messages is very cool. My friends are rapidly becoming Topps cards - anyone want to swap a 1999 Cory for a colour Danny O'Brien?

       Being somebody who's both 1) stupid and 2) fearless, I upgraded to Jaguar today. 

 
 My kensington mouse drivers produced kernel panics upon startup. unplugging the mouse fixed that.
 
 bash2.0.5(a), which I had built from off the gnu site, crashed on me when starting Terminal, luckily Jaguar has it's own version of bash, located in /bin/bash (in case you need to change things in NetInfo to get your Terminals to start again). this new bash doesn't understand dircolors.
 
 Mail still hates my Cyrus imap server. strange.. 
 Apple System Profiler now features crash logs. If that was there before, I must be blind. It's a nice touch.
 
 Rendezous is pretty neat. Stacy and I have been playing with it. iChat in general is pretty pleasant and much nicer than the aol aim client. (no more ads!)
 
 The orinoco wireless drivers for powerbook g3's no longer works, as many of you know. There are some rumors that they can be made to work. We'll keep you updated.
 
 The Dev tools for 10.2 come on a cd with Jaguar. Sofar, my old projects all build with it. 
 gcc is now 3.1 which fixed a strange error in a compiler I've been workig on where a char* array returned from NSString (with lossy ASCII conversion turned on) no longer had \0 as the last element. 
  urlLink Emacs (Carbon)  20.7 no longer works.  urlLink Emacs (Cocoa)  20.7 doesn't work, either. 
 

Basically, unless you enjoy misery, wait a few weeks to a month to make sure all of your existing OS X apps work with 10.2. I'm not unhappy I upgraded, though. It's very speedy.

       Question for Chris: Does that advice go for OS X, or just System 9? I'm surprized to see Speed Disk listed as something to run on OS X systems.
 
Note for Steve: the BEFW11S4 is a router, not a bridge, so it is likely that it does *very* different things with packets. Given that the WAP11 passed some packets just fine and only showed problems on some TCP streams, I can easily believe that adding router functionality would change things. Also note that Cory uses a WAP11 with OS X just fine, which indicates that the problem I'm having (and that he is not having) could be network-related, although that is incredibly hard to diagnose. The packet dumps I did showed that WAP11 wasn't receiving some TCP packets in a stream, FWIW.

       (Just to pick on Paul. ;-) I don't know specifically about the WAP11, but I use the Linksys  urlLink BEFW11S4  that I picked up on amazon for $135. As far as I can tell, it's just a souped up WAP11. I use it with a windows machine and an orinoco gold, my tibook and a g4 with added airport card and I never have problems.

       In response to my earlier post about kernel panic woes John Oswald wrote:
 
Do yourself a favor: get Norton's SystemWorks 2 and Disk Warrior. First install Disk Warrior on a drive and make a copy of the application itself. Take the Norton CD to a Mac with Toast and CD burner. Make a Toast image of Norton. Now double-lick the image and select mount. Open the mounted image and toss Spring Cleaning and Retrospect onto it (you'll still have them on the original disk). Next, copy Disk Warrior onto the disk and put Disk First Aid 8.6.1 on there as well. Drag the mounted disk to the Trash, double-click the icon again and burn. I know this sounds like a little bit of trouble, but after what you just did this is a can of corn.

I work on Macs every day and have only had one not function after using a combo of:
 
  Disk Warrior
  Disk First Aid
  Norton Disk Doctor
  Speed Disk
 
Use them in that order. In fact run them once a month and you probably won't ever see a major on your mac for a long time. One thing: I never install Norton on any of my drives. I only run it from the CD.

       There is plenty to be said about Jaguar and its  urlLink 150 new features , most of it positive. One very nice touch that made me smile is that the venerable Calculator has been updated for the first time since, oh, about 1984. It now has: an "advanced" mode with scientific functions, a paper tape, all sorts of unit conversions, and currency conversions with network-updatable exchange rates.

       I have seriously revised  urlLink my earlier posting about the Linksys WAP11 . In short, if you use OS X and/or an AirPort card, you should probably stay away from it. (Yes, I'll edit this posting too if someone says that one or both of those work with the WAP11.)
 
Basically, it turned out that my old AirPort base station *did* have the "capacitor of death" problem, but it was actually the "capacitors of death" (meaning both capacitors blew). I hadn't looked carefully enough. Fortunately, my good friend  urlLink Joel Snyder at Opus One  had given me two replacement capacitors when he heard I had an AirPort, so I didn't have to go out looking for them when I replaced them. (Although, I have misplaced my soldering iron, so I had to go visit a friend for that!) The  urlLink instructions on how to replace them  were pretty clear.  It's not for the faint of heart, but it sure beats paying $300 for a new AirPort.
 
The WAP11 goes back for a refund, and the AirPort base station is working fine again.

        How to Go From Kernel Panic to Clean Install in 14 Long Hours 
 
Yesterday morning I booted my laptop only to have it kernel panic in the middle of loading networking. "No big deal", I thought as I did the three-finger salute and started it up again. Was I ever wrong: the machine had flat-lined. The happy Mac would appear, the spinning beachball would appear, and then both would sit for a very, very long time with nary a hint of activity from the screen, machine or hard-drive. My Mac was dead in the water and, much to my horror, my last comprehensive back-up had been almost a month ago (don't call me  urlLink Dantz , I'm already calling you) so I definitely needed to be able to get the data off of it - a clean wipe and reinstall at this stage was just not an option.
 
After panicking for a bit, here's what I did to get up and running once again:
 
First, I read  urlLink Tech Note 106464: Mac OS X: Troubleshooting a Startup Issue  a few times through and then did everything it said, in the order it said it. fsck found a number of problems the first time through and repaired them (a second run of fsck went without issue) but that still didn't rectify the situation. Nor did anything else in this tech note but I did learn a lot about single-user mode and was at least able to see that my data was still all there on the drive. Some consolation, that.
 
Second, I called up my friend  urlLink Bones  and grilled him for any ideas he might have about how to tackle this issue. He had one, and it was a great one: I would bring my dead laptop over to his place, mount mine in Target mode onto his (see  urlLink Tech Note 58583: Macintosh: How to Use FireWire Target Disk Mode  for details), copy the data off and then be free to do whatever I wanted to my machine.
 
We tried it and it worked like a charm: a few hours later all my data was backed up to CD and I was breathing a sigh of relief. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank whichever people inside Apple came up with the idea and implementation of Target mode: you're all farkin' brilliant!
 
From there I clean-installed the OS starting with 10.1 and working my way all the way up to a nice, shiny, super-fast loading 10.1.5. I also took this opportunity to not install OS 9 on the machine. Its time to walk without the safety-net (and I can't actually remember the last time I used 9 anyhow).
 
Finally, I called up my neighbourhood computer products co-op and bought a 60 Gig Firewire drive to act as a backup source for all my machines. Soon I'll be installing X onto it so I can use it as a boot drive if necessary; for the time being I've contented myself with backing up the contents of my current system to it in its entirety.
 
At last, 14 hours later, all is well with the world again.

       A little birdie tells me that in Jaguar, screenshots are saved in PDF instead of TIFF. This is a pain in the ass for me, as I'm all the time taking selective screenshots of bits of webpages that I want to include on Boing Boing, then resizing them and converting them to JPEG with ToyViewer, the excellent free NextStep lightweight image-editor. However, ToyViewer can't resize PDFs, and what's more, if I set the default app for opening PDFs to ToyViewer, I won't be able to view actual PDFs properly (and if I don't, I'll have to drag-and-drop every screenshot file onto ToyViewer).
 
I need a lightweight image-editor (resize, crop, convert to JPG or PNG) that can read PDFs. The GIMP is definitely overkill, and Photoslop is hundreds of dollars. Anyone got a reccomendation for a magic image-editor that suits my needs?

       Is Apple shipping an iPhone soon? The NYT thinks so. I would so dig a phone/PDA from Apple, running Darwin (OS X's Unix) underneath, based on the iPod: 20GB of MP3s, a phone, a DOM-compliant browser, a mini email client all tied by Firewire to OS X.

 
 Sherlock in particular has been repositioned in a way that would make it a perfect counterpart for a portable phone. Its original purpose, which was finding files and content on the computer's local disk, has been transformed into a more general "find" utility program. Now, Sherlock is being extended to search for types of information like airline and movie schedules and restaurant locations. The software can display maps and driving directions.

       "If you are turning on WEP (which anyone with any sense does)..."
 
Erm, I beg to differ, Paul. I leave WEP off on all four of my access points, for a number of reasons:

 
  Having no WEP makes it easier and faster for you to connect to your network

  WEP doesn't provide any security from malefactors, who have ready access to tools that can trivially derive even 128-bit WEP keys, using well-understood exploits

  Protocol security (i.e., ssh, scp and ssl) are good data hygeine in general. I connect to lots of networks (as, I suspect, do many wireless users) -- hotels, cafes, etc. Anyone not employing these measures should assume that his data is being sniffed on the wire

  Leaving WEP off facilitates the use of your networks by both friends and strangers. If you pick an  urlLink ISP  that allows you to share your connection, you can legally contribute to a climate of cooperativism and you can do a mitzvah for your neighbors and for your community

  Providing anonymous access to the Internet upholds the First Amendment right to anonymous speech; a tradition that benefits many citizens of a thriving democracy, such as whistle-blowers, dissidents, and embarrassed teens who want to research VD

  Providing access to the Internet via a wireless access point arguably makes your into an ISP for the purposes of the safe-harbor provisions in the Communications Decency Act (CDA) and Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which means that you don't carry liability for threats, pr0n, infringement, etc, trasnmitted through your AP. You'll be in the same safe-harbor that protects libraries, Internet cafes, Internet kiosks, smart payphones, and other anonymous access points.

       [[ This post originally discussed me replacing my dead Airport base station with a 
 urlLink Linksys WAP11 
that cost $135.
After using it for a while and finding some weird network problems, I probed further. I'm now pretty sure that the WAP11 does not
work reliable with Airport cards, with the TCP/IP stack in OS X, or both. The easy-to-reproduce syptom was that I could send very
short mail (where the message all fit into one TCP packet) but could not send longer messages. Using tcpdump, I could
see that the second packet of the message was simply not going through. When I switched to Ethernet, it worked fine.
And, after I fixed my Airport, that worked fine.
 
I hope no one followed my earlier message about using the WAP11. If so, I apologize. I'll leave in my previous note about using WEP passwords from OS X with non-Airport base stations.]]

 You will find a horrible gotcha in OS X that is unrelated to the
Linksys box. In the Network system pref, to enter an ASCII password
for a non-Airport base station, you have to surround it with
quotation marks even though you don't use them for Airport
base stations. This is incredibly confusing, and caused me to
waste a lot of time. It also caused me to call Linksys and discover
that their tech support is incredibly lame (although it was
toll-free in the US).

 For more information on how to use OS X with non-Airport
base stations, see  urlLink 
AppleCare document 106250 , which also shows the magic you
need to use to enter a hex password.

  type "sudo patch -b   launch Explorer

  to search Google, click in the location bar (or type command-L) and type a ?, then your query

 

Of course, Moz does all of this without having to screw around with patches...

       By default, Windows Media Player encodes your music collection using your machine's unique key, so that you can't share, loan or give away the tracks you rip to your machine. What that means is, if you have some file-system or OS corruption and reinstall from scratch, then restore your music collection, it will be unusable. You won't be able to play the files. There's a backup utility that'll preserve your license keys, but if you fail to employ it, you're SOL -- MSFT's position is that you need to start over from scratch at that point, re-ripping all the CDs in your collection. Speaking as someone with 30GB of MP3s, ripped from over 1,000 CDs in a process that took days, I gotta say, I'm glad I'm an OSX user.

        It looks like Apple is trying to make the $100 (or $50 for the early birds) .mac
accounts go a bit further than most people initially thought.
 
 
	 100 Free Kodak Prints (4x6 only) 
	 Backup app that will span CDRs 
	 Free download of the Popcap game Alchemy 
	 $5 off Bejeweled 
	 and finally the .Mac Slides Published 
 
 
At first I thought it was quite a list.  Then I took another look.  Both  urlLink Alchemy 
and  urlLink Bejewled  are available online from MSN's  urlLink The Zone .  Even Adam over at  urlLink The Flangy News  thought it was odd that games available online for free were being sold in a box.
 
 
The new Backup app is just an update that most paying customers would expect anyways.
 
 
I gave the .Mac Slides a test drive and boy was I under whelmed.  The pictures get scaled down for uploading, then when run at full screen look horrible.  You can subscribe to more than one slide show, but from my tests, you can only publish one slide show at a time.
 
 
But the one that makes it all worth while is the 100 free prints.  Now there is something I can actually use.  Of course, you only have until Dec. 31st to use up your 100 free 4x6 prints.
 
 
If these little gems keep showing up in my .mac account, I may start to feel like it was almost worth paying for... ;-)

       Maybe I'm the last person on the planet to know about this, but on a recommendation from macosxhints.com, I went into Finder Preferences and unchecked every language, even English, under "Languages for searching file contents."  All of a sudden the Finder's performance sucks much, much less. (I'm using a 500mhz iBook with only 320 MB of RAM, not one of them dang hot-rods like you kids have.) I think I've asked the Finder to search within a range of files perhaps twice since adopting OS X; I'm much more liable to use grep. So this is a feature-for-performance trade-off I'm happy to make.

       To give a first-person example supporting Paul's observation: a friend recently upgraded his girlfriend's iBook to OS X. He's a Unix geek, she's a brand-new novice Mac (and computer) user. He finds it incredibly attractive that he can trouble-shoot it his way while she uses it her way, and I no longer get tech support calls about OS 9, which makes me very happy.

       Fully agree with the other Paul. What I find even more heartening is that bringing in the Unix geeks is not diminishng the attractiveness of the Mac to novices and art folks. They are orthogonal markets that Apple is courting in different ways. (Well, not completely different ways: the geek-attracting ads in Scientific American look like all the other Mac ads...)

It sounds like Apple should not offer rebates if they have no intention of honoring them.  urlLink An irate letter from a long-time Mac fan  would hopefully wake up someone at Apple; maybe not.
 
At this point, the Apple Store is still being devious (read: dishonest) about rebates. They advertise rebates on some items, but when you read the fine print, you find out that the rebate only applies if you  don't buy from the Apple Store . It looks like they are taking co-op advertising money but screwing the customer.

       Some nifty but obscure (obscure to relative Unix newbies like me anyway) things come along with the BSD layer.  For instance there's the "look" command, which by default searches /usr/share/dict/words (a list of about 250,000 English words and proper names). You can't use regular expressions with "look", though. For more flexibility (let's say you're a word-game nut), define this alias:  alias words cat /usr/share/dict/words | egrep 
To mimic the behavior of  look foo  you'd type  words -i ^foo , but now you can do many more cool and useless things (like finding all words in which the letters "abcde" appear in sequence:  words "a.*b.*c.*d.*e" ). You'll be completing impossible rhyming couplets faster than you can say "zygosporange."

        urlLink Chimera  is an excellent thing: fast tabbed browsing without the cruft.  It's only at 0.6, though, so it's unsurprising that it's missing some features.  One that's been a real pain is the ability to export bookmarks in a form that other browsers can read.
 
I wanted to get my Chimera bookmarks file into MSIE (never mind why).  Browsing the Chimera mailing list, I came across  urlLink this script , which the author claims will find your Chimera bookmarks and export them as a conventional HTML bookmark file in the folder from which you ran the script.  Well, sort of.  Trying to import the resulting file into MSIE, I just got a link to the file, which wasn't quite what I had in mind.
 
But what the heck!  I didn't have Mozilla installed, but in these days of broadband, what's a multi-megabyte download just to check out a hunch?  And I was right: Mozilla 1.2 imports the file flawlessly, and MSIE can then import from Mozilla's own bookmark file.  Okay, so Mozilla is now back on my system as a 35.3MB bookmark conversion utility.  Oh well.

       My PowerBook had its AC adapter die on it a few months back, and has been out of comission until yesterday, when I bought a new one. This is why I dislike putting my PowerBook in anything other than sleep mode:
 
1. Power on PowerBook. Get Happy Mac. Wait a long time. Listen to a distinctly audible and memorable repeating disk read/write pattern ("click, click, cliccccck... click, click, cliccccck..."). Get hypnotized by the spinning disk.
 
2. Finally get OS X log in screen after OS X comes alive and does it's boot-up check phase with all the various runlevels and what not. Log in.
 
3. Wait a little bit for Finder to load, as well as some other things I start on launch.
 
4. Open a Finder browser window. Listen to the same disk pattern for approximately the same amount of time or more. Get hypnotized by the spinning disc, again.
 
5. Proceed to work away just fine until I shut down the PowerBook and do the whole thing again.
 
I've had this problem for a while (way before the power adapter died, in case you were wondering), and although I'm planning to upgrade to 10.2 soon (I'm at 10.1.5 now) via Scorched Earth Technique, I'm wondering if there's a solution I can apply to make the interim current use experience more pleasureable. I thought about using fsck, but I'm not sure how it treats HFS+ drives (I've read somewhere that the kernel treats everything like UFS, but that this is just meant as an abstraction layer, not the actual file system on the disk), and I'm not sure if there are any good disk tools for OS X that might solve this problem. I suppose it *might* be a defragmentation issue, but somehow I doubt it. Bad sectors? Maybe, but seems unlikely. How can I do disk diagnostics in OS X just to find out what's up? Is fsck okay?
 
Hopefully toasting everything and then moving to 10.2 will solve most of my issue, if all else fails.

        So lately I've been seeing mail messages with people's photos in them.  This is odd since they weren't HTML emails.  They were just plain old text messages.  No funky X-headers either.
 
   
 
What's going on here?  I think I have the answer.  If you are using Mail.app, when you get a message from a mac.com address, Mail.app will then make an HTTP request to homepages.mac.com looking for a thumbnail.  If it finds one, it will display it with the message.
 
 
How do you get the thumbnail?  You have to enable it in the webmail preferences in your .mac account.  "Big deal," you say.  This feature is listed on the  urlLink first page  of the .mac tour.  Indeed it is.  But you only have to use the webmail interface to upload your photo.  After that, it's all taken care of by Mail.app on the recipient's end.  I'm assuming that they make you use the upload interface so they can scale the image to the right aspect ration.  At least, that's my theory. [  urlLink Discuss ]

BBEdit 7.0 allows you to configure multiple Web sites in the preferences and then work with files from any of the defined sites. Syntax coloring support for ASP/VBScript has been added, as well as XHTML 1.1 support in the HTML Tools and syntax checker, and a "Close Current Tag" command which speeds and simplifies HTML tag creation and editing.
 
For text editing, BBEdit 7.0 adds support for selecting and operating on rectangular regions of text.
 
Bare Bones also added a few general improvements including a "Paste Previous Clipboard" command, Quartz text smoothing support in editing views, improved support for Mac OS X Services (on Mac OS X 10.2), plus palette-savvy window resizing and a new "atop" window stacking option. A new plug-in info window displays version information, online help, and web links for installed plug-ins. Plug-ins can also now be installed via drag-and-drop.

       The Humane Environment is an open source alternative GUI in OS X, created by Jef "creator of the Mac" Raskin. Still in development and very much a proof-of-concept.

 
The Humane Environment (THE) is as easy to learn as a GUI (or easier) yet as fast to use (or faster) than the command-line systems we struggle to learn but love to use. It is easier to add new software to than any previous interface-based system.
 
Important observation: You cannot make an interface better without making it different (that's obvious). If it's a lot better, it will be a lot different. This means that it will feel unfamiliar to anybody familiar with present interfaces. Therefore, it has to be used for a while (after you read the manual) before you unlearn your present habits and can begin to appreciate it. You are in a worse position for learning it than a novice who has only to acquire new habits and has nothing to unlearn!

       This afternoon, my Address Book mysteriously emptied itself. Looking through ~/Library/Addresses/Address Book.addressbook, I saw that all my contacts appear to be there, but when I try to sync my iPod, iSync tells me that there are 670+ contacts to delete. I tried moving the iSync.vcf off my iPod and then importing it into Address Book, but the import process doesn't populate the window with my contacts.
 
I tried logging in as another user and successfully imported the iSync.vcf file. Then I tried exporting it, logging back in as me, and re-importing. Address Book hung.
 
I tried deleting ~/Library/Addresses/ and ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.AddressBook.plist, and tried importing either the iSync.vcf file or the other, new file. In the case of the file from my iPod, it zipped through, but did not create a new ~/Library/Addresses folder or any new contacts. In the case of my imported-then-exported file, Address Book hung again.

I'm stumped. I need this data on my effing Mac. What do I do?

         urlLink mi  (formerly MMKEdit) is a nice little free Carbon (OS9/OSX) text-editor. It doesn't have as many features or the slick UI of BBEdit Pro, but it certainly has more flexibility that the free BBEdit Lite.

       Help me, oh blogosphere...I've just moved to rural Sweden, and my only option for connectivity beyond 7k dialup is two-way satellite broadband. It works well, except that I am getting a vast number of Network TimeOut errors. Is there a way of lengthening the network time-out interval, so that, for example, posting an entry to my Movable Type blog doesn't timeout halfway through?

       Gotta plug Matisse Enzer's new book,   urlLink UNIX for Mac OS X: Visual QuickPro Guide  . I just got my copy this week, and within about 10 minutes I accomplished something I had wanted to try for months (namely, using  urlLink rsync  via ssh to create local mirrors of websites I work on).  This is an ideal book for migrators to OS X who are interested in the Unix underpinnings.

        urlLink Seth  tells me that in the Linux world, people are accustomed to doing something called " urlLink one-armed routing ." That's where you route on a single Ethernet interface, by creating a fake virtual interface that has an internal network address as well as the real interface with the real network address. I used to do this under OS 9 with IPNetRouter when I had a machine acting as a NAT/DHCP box running on a DSL modem in my old building.
 
Does anyone know how to do one-armed routing under OS X on Airport? This could be incredibly useful in situations where, for some reason (having paid a subscription fee, having an authenticated MAC address, having a superior antenna) one user has access to a WiFi network but others don't -- you could republish the network around your machine and share it with others. Right now, I usually accomplish this trick by connecting my Airport base-station to my iBook with an Ethernet cable and bridging whatever connection I can get onto down to the AP. It would be handy to pull this off without the Airport AP. Any ideas?

       Thanks to Paul H. for that note. I am a statistics ignoramus, though I have read enough to know that the term "Bayesian" is being used loosely (and that there is some debate over whether it applies to these techniques at all). It's also not inclusive of everything a tool like SpamSieve does. I was going to include a comment to that effect, but couldn't bear to add one more qualifying parenthetical to an already convoluted post.

For better or worse, "Bayesian" seems to have been adopted as the common term for this sort of filtering. If that's bad usage, I think now is the time to strike with alternative suggestions!

       Without commenting on SpamSieve, I would note that "Bayesian" anything is a somewhat meaningless term, akin to "artificial intelligence". There is a great book on the (actually quite short) history of statistics called  urlLink The Lady Tasting Tea , and it has good material on why Bayesian can mean anything that is close to "gets better with more good data", which is true for almost anything.

       (This is rather long winded. Short version: check out  urlLink SpamSieve .)
  
It's been a while since I posted about spam filtering. For many months I've been happily using  urlLink mailfilter  by Andreas Bauer, and I even put up some  urlLink instructions  to help other people use it. It has killed over 20,000 pieces of spam for me. However, with 300+ rules I have hit the point of diminishing returns -- it's hard to add individual rules that make much of an improvement in the overall accuracy, and the whole shebang is higher-maintenance than I want it to be.  And, while in general I love mailfilter's kill-it-on-the-server method, it's a real bummer when you get that rare false positive, because you have to 1) notice that it happened 2) dig the sender's e-mail address out of the log, and 3) beg for a re-send.
  Lots of people use and love  urlLink SpamAssassin . It's great. However, it can be complex to set up and maintain, and you've got to keep it up to date as spammers learn to game its rules. 
   What if you had software that, instead of using tons of  rules by clever humans, simply learned by example what spam is, and kept learning? 
  That's the hot thing in spam fighting now --  urlLink Bayesian  filtering. I'll leave the details to smarter people, but it is essentially a statistical method in which individual tokens (words) are mapped to probabilities. For example, a quick look at my spam log of 700+ recent spams shows that my last name shows up in 4 spams and 254 "good" messages, making it a strong (but not absolute) indicator of non-spam.  Conversely, the term "hcode" shows up in 304 spam messages and no legitimate messages, making it a very good indicator of spam. What's "hcode"? I have no idea -- something that shows up in spammers' HTML a lot, I'd guess. It's obviously incredibly predictive, yet  I never would have created a rule to look for it .   That's the beauty of this approach. Instead of trying to cleverly create individual rules that identify spam, you simply feed your Bayesian engine a pile of spam, and a pile of good mail, and it learns the difference. (It does weighting like SpamAssassin, but instead of weighting rules, it individually weights every unique word.) Read  urlLink Paul Graham 's highly influential "A Plan for Spam" essay for more on this. Really, read it.  It's excellent.    Actual usable software using these techniques includes Eric S. Raymond's (yes,  urlLink that  Eric S. Raymond)  urlLink bogofilter , various applications of the  urlLink ifile  utility, and (finally, here we are)  the product I'm trying out right now:   urlLink SpamSieve  .   SpamSieve works with Eudora (which is what I use), Entourage Mailsmith, Powermail, and Emailer. (What about Mail.app, you ask? Well, reportedly, Mail.app's built-in spam killer is actually a Bayesian filter, and works great. So if you are a Mail.app user, I guess you're all set...)  You train SpamSieve with a batch of good messages and a batch of bad, then correct it whenever it screws up. It learns fast.   People who are wrapped up in making clever rules for complex filtering systems can't believe how effective Bayesian filtering is. After just a few days of training, SpamSieve has exceeded the accuracy of my mailfilter setup (about 95%) and is still climbing -- even messages that it correctly identifies as spam are used to improve its accuracy. People have reported accuracy of up to 99.5% with Bayesian filtering.
  I am fully convinced that this is the future of spam-killing. (Well, actually, I think there's also a place for  urlLink Brightmail -type honeypots, but that's another story.)  Check it out.   urlLink Discuss

After looking at  urlLink Anonymous  for a minute, I thought  urlLink Moniz  might have a point.

And yet a  urlLink side by side comparison  (L: monaco, R: Anonymous) in what was presumably Lamkins' favorite editor left me feeling that Anonymous looks a little cluttered or unfinished at smaller sizes (it looks pretty good at 48pt, I will admit) compared to Monaco.

"After reviewing numerous platforms, Ott said Terayon went with the Mac platform for its ease  of  use and price performance, especially in the area of storage where Mac supports less  costly IDE drives rather than SCSI which is typical of 1U rack mounted servers."

        So, here is my hypothesis on this whole mess.  Apple put that in their SDK because this is a feature, streaming playlists via Rendezvous, that they have stated that they are rolling into iTunes.  They haven't rolled the feature out yet because they got a big enough threat from the  RIAA .  So the promised  killer  iTunes feature goes  MIA .  Is any of this true?  I don't know, like I said it's just my hypothesis.  But when I first heard Jobs talk about it the first thing that popped into my mind was the impending lawsuit to be filed by the RIAA nanoseconds after the first download of iTunes with streaming finished.
 

 
Does it suck that Apple is possibly using it's SDK to keep out competitors and innovators?  Certainly, it goes against the very idea of a SDK.  It reeks of Microsoft.  Is there more going on behind the scenes?  You bet.  It's just a matter of time until we find out what it is though.
 

 
As far as  urlLink iHam on Rye , it's more of a remote control.  You can control iTunes from a remote computer, but you can't get the music from that computer.  Now, it is the perfect "office jukebox" app to install on a mac that is hooked up to the office stereo.  But then we all know  urlLink what happens  to companies that have office mp3 servers.

       More on  urlLink iCommune : Since it seems that Apple is unwilling to allow innovation, James Speth has decided to change iCommune into a stand-alone app. Here's the rest of his  urlLink wishlist  for the upcoming version:
  
 
 a stand-alone application that manages network accessible music libraries
 able to generate  and manage playlists for your favorite mp3 player
 able to communicate with and control your mp3 player using AppleEvents
 Rendezvous-enabled
 built with a robust indexer and XML format that properly handles non-ASCII characters
 completely free of any Apple proprietary code or interface use
 completely open source under the GPL
 
  
  
Is there anybody who can explain to  urlLink me  why it's not in Apple's best interest to have left applications like iCommune alone? Why does the iTunes Device SDK license disallow network use? Is it fear of the DMCA?
  
Should we continue to develop for a vendor that bullies it's developers? Certainly Apple has the right to put whatever clause into any license they see fit just as we have the right to 'Switch Back' to Linux, *BSD, or any of the other platforms where we won't get harassed. Please pardon my rant but it really does bother me.

The big reason tabs rock?  It gets rid of waiting for the network.  You're reading along and then just command click on what you are interested in.  You mess around on the page a little bit and then switch over.  It turns a click-wait-read-click-wait-read experience into click-click-read-read.

       Here's a notion that might help keep Chimera alive.  Like a lot of people, I grabbed Safari and started using it right away.  I love the speed and the uncluttered interface.  But (you knew this was coming) I  really  miss tabs.  Trouble is, I've added tons of bookmarks and done some major re-organizing since going over to Safari.  The prospect of having to  manually  redo all of that, if I went back to Chimera, keeps me from making the jump back.
 
Thing is, the Safari bookmarks are just an ASCII file, as are Chimera's.  It ought to be possible for someone who knows what they're doing to write a tool for converting Safari bookmarks to Chimera's format, or any other.  It's beyond me, but it's obvious that it's possible.  If such a tool existed, I'd go back to Chimera in a hot minute, and I doubt I'm unique in this.

       Jim Speth,  urlLink iCommune's  author, has  urlLink posted the letter he received from Apple's legal department on Slashdot . Here's the key paragraph: It has come to our attention that you are distributing a software program called iCommune that violates the terms of the Apple Computer, Inc. iTunes Device Plug-In SDK Agreement you executed. The iTunes SDK materials are licensed only for the purpose of enabling the Licensee's hardware device identified in the agreement to interoperate with iTunes. The iTunes SDK is not licensed for use in a software program for sharing of music over a network. Your distribution of this program is a violation of the license agreement and of Apple's intellectual property rights. Speth's license allows him to develop a "component system mp3 player console" plug-in. He explains that he's honouring that agreement: Now, my description of the device might be a little vague, but it does describe an application for which I use iCommune. I have a Mac G4 Cube set up as the media center of my living room. It's hooked into my stereo and television. I use iTunes and iCommune on the Cube to turn it into the mp3 player console I was envisioning when I started work on it. I use iCommune on my laptop to control that system. Unlike your typical device which is directly connected to the computer running iTunes, these systems talk over the network to each other. I think I'm in compliance with the agreement, but they don't. Hopefully we'll be able to work something out. Otherwise, I'm thinking of ways to do this without the Device Plug-in API, so the project might survive.  urlLink IANAL , but I think the description of iCommune that Speth gave when signing up for the SDK license might have been a little  too  vague. I'd be flexible enough to accept iCommune's streaming capabilities under the "console" umbrella -- iCommune could be considered a remote control with awesome range, letting you listen to your music library from anywhere in the wired world. I think that the file-sharing capability  might  fall beyond the accepted definition of "console".

         The author of  urlLink iCommune , a music sharing plugin for iTunes, has received a "Notice of Breach and Termination of License" letter from Apple, stating that he violated the license to the Device Plug-in API which iCommune uses. For the time being, he's making the download unavailable, while he tries to sort things out with Apple. Any good lawyers in the house?  [via  urlLink macmegasite ] 
 

At first glance, this doesn't appear to bode well for Apple's stewardship of their developer community. If I could find the license in question, I'd look over it and give a more informed opinion but several google queries and search queries against developer.apple.com have turned up zilch.

       The availability of Apple's new X11 beta (mentioned by Patrick below) means that it's now a hell of a lot easier to get   urlLink OpenOffice.org   (yes, the .org is part of the product name, don't ask) running on your Mac, though the downloads  are  gargantuan. So for all you mortals like me who never could quite muster up the courage to install XFree86 before, the routine is, roughly:  Download and install Apple's  urlLink X11  beta (about 40M) Download the latest  urlLink OpenOffice.org installer  (about 200M) Run the OpenOffice.org installer (you can leave out Ghostscript) Launch X11 Add an entry to the X11 Applications menu -- path should be something like "/Applications/OpenOffice.org1.0.1/program/soffice" Launch the app by selecting it from that menu (ignore the  urlLink "Start OpenOffice.org"  script for now, because it doesn't yet work with Apple's X11).    
 It's weird having a Windows-clone UI running via XWindows on a Macintosh, but eventually those interface wrinkles will get smoothed out.  The key bullet point here is: the shit  works .

       Having  urlLink some   urlLink people  over to stay this Christmas, we've been trying to get Rendezvous to work within my home wifi network. No joy so far.

       Thanks to  urlLink The Jenson , I'm now running OS X 10.2.3  with journaling  on my PowerBook. Ah, glorious new software. One weird thing I've noticed thus far is that when I switch tracks on CDs, iTunes spins the disc down and then spins it back up again, with obvious dead air, lag time, and the sound of the drive oscillating. One potentially useful tip: if you're using a laptop, tweak the font smoothing to the "Medium - best for Flat Panel" setting in General in System Preferences. Made things less fuzzy yet noticeably better than no font smoothing (if you like font smoothing) on my laptop display.

       Assorted notes on Macworld Expo:
 
 It is very likely that Apple is doing well with Mac users.
The show was fairly crowded on Thursday, which is a
good sign. Usually, Thursday is starting to drag. The mood was
upbeat.
 It is really hard to pin a label on the majority of Mac users.
It is clear to me that I'm not in that majority, at least from the
products I saw exhibited. I'm not a graphics designer or a music
creator or a video producer. It seemed like over half the show
was catering to people in those businesses.
 There are a  lot  of Switchers. Apple nailed this one pretty
well. My fond hope is that Apple does to Word what it just did to
Internet Explorer, and make it OSX-specific. A reasonable business
model would be like QuickTime: free for low-end, $30 for the more
advanced model (advanced features could be Word import/export and
style sheets).
 The 17-inch PowerBook is heavy and long. Prediction: a zillion of
them need to be fixed even before their 1-year warranty is up due to
issues arising from torque. Nice screen, though.
 Lots of people talking about Safari. Almost no one talking about
the new iApps.
 I bought a really comfortable mouse called the Contour
UniMouse. This is the first mouse I have bought for daily use,
ever. $25 show price. So, where are all the low-cost USB keyboards?
PS2-based keyboards are under $5, but you can't find a USB keyboard
for under $40.
 Sadly, only a few BMUG t-shirts seen. &lt;/era&gt;

       A  huge  security problem in Safari is that there is no control over the trusted certificates, or for user certificates. Well, there probably is some control, but it certainly isn't in the Safari UI.

       One of the cool things to come out of yesterday is Apple's adoption of KHTML and KJS for use in Safari and thus the resources of Apple being directed towards improving these two technologies, now called  urlLink WebCore  and  urlLink JavaScriptCore  by Apple.
 
Interestingly, JavaScripeCore makes use of the  urlLink PCRE   regex library which will hopefully (or does?) make it generally accessible to other applications.
 
And finally, check out  urlLink this email from Don Melton  , an Apple engineer on Safari describing Apple's commitment to KHTML and KJS ( thanks George! ) loosely describing their integration process and future plans. This ought to be interesting.

       Getting your bookmarks into Safari is relatively easy once you figure out that the first time Safari runs it imports your Internet Explorer bookmarks.  If MSIE was where your primary bookmark file lived, you're done. If not, first export your primary bookmarks into MSIE. Then you just need to convince Safari that it's running for the "first time", which as far as I can tell is done by deleting its prefs file from ~/Library/Preferences, and deleting the folder ~/Library/Safari as well. 
 
Initial impressions of Safari: Wow, it sure is fast. Even on this pokey 500mhz iBook.   Give us back our tabs!   Sure is fast, though.  [INTERIOR: cups banging on prison cafeteria table]    Tabs! Tabs! Tabs!   Seems to render CSS layouts okay, a few nonfatal glitches. No provision for bookmark-menu separator spaces, that's annoying.   Tabs! The people demand tabs!

Okay, I'll chime in.  Coolest thing not talked about at the keynote:  urlLink Apple's X11 beta .  Now Cory can finally run  urlLink gimp .  The buzz on the show flow was good.  I was working the  urlLink EFF  booth, which is in the 4100 section of the North Hall by the way, and people seemed very jazzed.
 

 
Cory and I were chatting about Apple taking on Microsoft with  urlLink Safari  and  urlLink Keynote .  Good luck Apple, you're going to need it.  But I have to say, it's good to see Microsoft getting some prodding once in a while.

       Geez, we're a bunch of wankers. It's 5:30 in the afternoon, and no one has posted about all the new announcements. (I kinda have an excuse in that I'm not going to the show until Thursday.)
 
I downloaded  urlLink Safari , the new web browser. Looks like the iTools, yup yup. Brushed nickel is your friend. But there was a bad start: there is no way to import bookmarks from programs like URL Manager. I played with Safari a bit, and it is certainly zippy.The position of newly-opened windows is completely lame and pretty unpredictable for large windows. I tried the "block pop-up" feature by going to a few random pr0n sites, and it does seem to work well. It's a spiffy product, but I'm not changing yet.
 
OK, the rest of you with post privs should start chiming in...

       DivX -- the highly compressed video format used on many file-sharing nets and websites -- is notoriously hard to get running under OS X.

        It looks like Apple is in pre-MacWorld full swing mode.   urlLink iCal  gets a point upgrade and  urlLink iSync  finally gets out of beta.  The speed improvements in iCal 1.0.1 are dramatic and were badly needed.  In case you don't do README files, do a sync before you install the new iSync and when your Palm doesn't show up, go back into the Conduit Settings and reset the iSync conduit.  The first sync is going to be  funky  (lots of changed records), but the docs claim that is normal.  I just did a sync with my Palm Vx and my data is okay, ymmv though ;-) 
 
Oh, and speaking of MacWorld...if you are are going to be at the expo, drop by the  urlLink EFF  booth and say hi.

       If you've managed to get InnoDB working with MySQL under X, I'd very much like to talk to you. I've created a  my.cnf  file in  /usr/local/mysql/data/  with the following:

innodb_data_file_path=ibdata1:50M;ibdata2:50M 
innodb_data_home_dir=/usr/local/mysql/data

        Fun with Perl, DBI and mysql  
I just spent a nice afternoon reinstalling perl (who knew that the multithreaded version of 5.8 didn't work with DBI? Ok,  urlLink a lot of peopl e but not me), installing DBI and the MySQL DBD driver.  "Great", think I, "now I'm ready to go." I grab  urlLink "Programming the Perl DBI"  and dive in... to a bone-dry pool. No connection to my database, no idea why.
 
Turns out that the connection for mysql is subtly different than that for msql (I don't know why I thought they might be similar; a whimsical moment of hopefulness I suppose). In "PtPDBI" they describe the msql connect as:
  dbi:mSQL:hostname:database:port  
but for mysql it must be:
  dbi:mysql:host=hostname:db=database:port  
Took me almost an hour of  urlLink googling  to hunt that little tidbit down, buried deep in someone else's question on some mailing list somewhere. So as a public service I now archive it here for you.  urlLink Discuss

I have a question about weird powerbook behaviour: it's making strange noises. Like,  really  strange. Every keyboard or mouse event seems to generate a very, very quiet click from inside the machine; moving your finger around the trackpad sounds like a geiger counter.
 
 
It's not the audio system -- turning the speaker off doesn't stop it happening. I don't think it's software-related, either (certainly my iBook didn't make these noises, and neither does the desktop G4 in the next room). It doesn't  sound like the drive seeking. It  might  be some  kind of electrical interference directly tweaking  the speakers, but I don't particularly want to start opening up the laptop and snipping wires to find out. Anyone got any ideas? It's driving me nuts -- I get paranoid when computers do things I can't explain ...
  
 Update : I found other Powerbook owners complaining of the same thing at  Powerbook Zone , so it's not just my imagination. Weirdly, the noises stop when the machine is running on battery juice and the CPU is throttled back. So it appears to be something related to the CPU cooling system ...

Hmm -- it looks as if OS X 10.2.4 supports journaling, and not just on the Server edition. There's no "enable journal" button in the Info pane of Disk Utility, but when I opened a terminal window and typed:

... It created a journal file and enabled journaling on my new Powerbook G4.

       At long last, Quark has posted a  urlLink teaser page about XPress 6 , the Carbonized, coming-sometime version of their page layout app. Sigh.
   
I used to be a graphic designer. I  lived  in Quark XPress. Thousands of hours, thousands of pages. I still remember the keyboard shortcut for "decrease tracking by 1/200th of an em," though I would rather not. It's not my bread and butter anymore, but I've been following the app's creep toward OS X, and like most have been boggled by the slow pace. In many cases this is the only thing binding design pros to OS 9. They want to migrate to OS X, but they can't.
  
As of this moment the page says almost nothing about the new version, only noting "enhanced undo functionality, full-resolution previews, and an intriguing way to manage complex projects." Strikingly uninformative -- and the screen shot promises little new other than Aqua trim on XPress's well-worn, spartan interface. Of course, we shouldn't judge print apps by web time. The task of publishing a magazine is substantially the same now as it was ten years ago, and most large publishing workgroups are slow to upgrade because of myriad software dependencies (I wonder how far they're gotten with updating  urlLink QPS ?).  The important thing is that they  get this thing out the frickin' door . 
  Though Quark is widely criticized in the industry for an unresponsive attitude toward customers, I really would like them to survive, because I believe that an Adobe monopoly -- which is what we are heading for -- would ultimately be bad for the industry.  urlLink Discuss

       If you have PHP installed and you've loaded up 10.2.4 you've probably noticed that PHP no longer works. By editing httpd.conf in the following way I was able to get PHP back and running.  Disclaimer:  I don't really know what I'm doing here, I'm just a guy armed with BBEdit and some vague notions. Follow my lead at your peril. That said:
 
  Open httpd.conf in the text editor of your choice.
  Find the following lines and uncomment them: 
 #LoadModule php4_module        libexec/httpd/libphp4.so  
 #AddModule mod_php4.c 
  Find this line: 
 Include /private/etc/httpd/users 
  And add this line right after it: 
 AddType application/x-httpd-php .php 
  Save.
  Open your System Preferences, go to Sharing and restart your web server.
 
PHP should be running again. At least, it is for me ;-)  urlLink Discuss

Installing  urlLink Ximian 's  urlLink Evolution   can  be done.  I used Apple's  urlLink X11 Server  and  urlLink fink   urlLink unstable  to do it.  The results were anti-climactic to say the least.  The cubic butt-ton of things that need to be installed for Evolution to run is daunting and even when you get it running it feels so out of place in the OS X environment.  Even a gtk Aqua theme can't do enough damage control on the interface to make it usable unless you have come from another platform where you were comfortable with Evolution.
 
 
An example of what you can expect with a fink install...
 
The following package will be installed or updated:
 evolution
The following 42 additional packages will be installed:
 bonobo bonobo-conf bonobo-conf-shlibs bonobo-shlibs freetype2-hinting
 freetype2-hinting-shlibs gal21-shlibs gconf gconf-shlibs gdk-pixbuf
 gdk-pixbuf-shlibs gnome-libs gnome-libs-shlibs gnome-mime-data gnome-print
 gnome-print-shlibs gnome-vfs-ssl gnome-vfs-ssl-shlibs gtk+ gtk+-data
 gtk+-shlibs gtkhtml1.1-shlibs guile guile-shlibs imlib imlib-shlibs libglade
 libglade-shlibs libpng libpng-shlibs libpng3-shlibs libtiff-bin
 libtiff-shlibs mozilla-shlibs netpbm-bin oaf oaf-shlibs orbit orbit-dev
 orbit-shlibs scrollkeeper soup-shlibs
 
 
 
I had the bright idea of installing some packages from stable, since there were binary packages and I didn't want to be compiling stuff for a week.  This is a  bad  idea.  The library/package conflicts that resulted were a dependancy nightmare.  I ended up just letting fink compile/install everything from unstable.
 
 
Installing Evolution is a lot like climbing a mountain.  Once you get back down, people will question why you climbed it in the first place.  "Because it was there," may be the only real answer.

        I bounce back and forth between those two candy-coloured operating systems, OS X and Windows XP, every day with the greatest of ease except for one serious annoyance: the difference in mouse acceleration. It was bad enough in the days of mice with balls, and now that my mice are all optical   urlLink castrati  , it's even more maddening. 

 Thankfully, my accordion-playing hobby exposes me to a lot of Mac-using raver kids (really). These pups -- some of whom have never known a world without the Macintosh -- are complete speed addicts (in many senses of the phrase, no less) and also find the Mac's maximum mouse speed a tad too languid for their liking. I don't know how it came up in conversation, but one of them pointed me to  urlLink MouseZoom , an extra control pane that can be added to your Preferences window. 

 The interface is raver-attention-span-friendly: it has just a single slider that lets you adjust the mouse speed on a continuous scale of 0 through 10. As you move the slider, a comment appears above it, giving you raver-friendly descriptions of the mouse speed: "Ok fast", "Nice and fast", "Uber fast!", "Ridiculously fast!" and "OS X crazy fast!!!" to name a few. The application tells you that standard maximum mouse speed is a pokey 1.7; I'm rather happy with mine set to a nice 3.2112674, the perfect speed for Python or PHP coding with some trippin' breakbeats in the background. Since it's just a preference pane, installation is simple: just put it in your  /Library/PreferencePanes  directory.

        Microsoft  urlLink has announced  that Exchange support will be rolled into Entourage this summer via a free download.  Yay!   Why is this a big deal?   This is a big deal because it will help Mac folks in an Exchange environment (and there are lots of Exchange environments out there, trust me).  Right now the Mac e-mail offerings from Microsoft include Outlook Express, Entourage, and Outlook for Mac.  Outlook Express is exactly what you would think it is, a simple e-mail client with POP/IMAP.  Entourage is OE plus PIM functionality.  Outlook for Mac is  only  for talking to an Exchange server.  Outlook for Mac also only runs under Classic, and poorly I might add.  Having at least a Carbon Exchange client that can also talk POP/IMAP is going to a huge relief for a lot of corp type Mac people I know.  It's too bad they have to wait for "summer 2003" before they can get it. 
 
Outlook for Mac was always an odd beast.  It wasn't written by the Mac Business Unit, so it never fit in well with the other Microsoft Mac offerings.  It was free, but Entourage wasn't.  People who need to talk to Exchange will obviously need Office.  
 
 
It always seemed odd to have  three  e-mail programs going when you only needed to have two, just like on Windows where there is only Outlook and Outlook Express.  [ Note:  I'm only talking about Microsoft offerings.  I know there are many other e-mail clients for POP/IMAP on Windows.]  It was an odd mistake for Microsoft to make, since they are typically a very efficient company.  Anyway, it's good to see this consolidation of features.

I wish there was a way to float the widgets in the foreground, set their transparency and resize them, though...

        I'm about to make my return to the world of "Cafe Coding". I'll be hauling a laptop to Tequila Bookworm -- a quirky neighbourhood cafe near my house -- and spending at least part of my working day there (I'll have to charm the manager into letting me access the AirPort perched atop the air conditioner unit -- it's not open). For the work-from-the-home-office kind of person, having a cafe where one can go to do and do work is almost necessary, especially if your home doesn't have a separate room designated as "the office". Having somewhere else to go helps keep me motivated, prevents me from goofing off (you can't take naps in a cafe) and keeps me from being isolated from the rest of humanity. 

 ("Get to the Mac-related part," I can already hear you saying.) 

 One of my projects is a PHP/MySQL thingy that will eventually be deployed on a server running TEH LUNIX. For this project, I'll be using my trusty 500MHz dual USB iBook (a machine that also happens to be Aaron Swartz's weapon of choice). I will also be "sharpening my saws" on Python, Java and C# (I'm running Rotor). It's proven to be a very handly little machine in the four months I've owned it. 

 Much higher up on the portable Mac product line is the 12" AlBook, which has roughly the same footprint as my iBook. Of course, its specs are much nicer, what with the 867MHz G4 processor, GeForce4 video card and pretty-much-full-size keyboard. It sounds as though it would be a pretty nice machine for the Cafe Coder, and in the O'Reilly MacDevCenter article  urlLink  A Developer's Perspective on Apple's 12-inch PowerBook  , author Wei Meng Lee is inclined to agree.

       Alsoft has announced  urlLink DiskWarrior 3 , the first OS X native version of that app. 

A lot of migrators from OS 9 ask me nervously about what kind of disk utilities they should be running.  I usually tell them not to worry about it -- the stability of the OS effectively eliminates those mid-write crashes that cause so much of the disk corruption under OS 9; the system automatically checks the disk on startup if it detects anything amiss; and for that feeling of extra protection you can always enable journaling. Anyway, despite my extreme anti-fuss stance I believe DiskWarrior is an excellent product, even if OS X has reduced my need for it to a mostly psychological, don't-tempt-fate sort of thing. If I were responsible for taking care of other folks' machines I would certainly have a copy handy always. The only fault I can find with this version at first look is that it doesn't support UFS.  urlLink Discuss

I'd like to add some more information on the Ximian  urlLink Evolution on Mac OS X  idea.  If you are connecting to a Microsoft Exchange™ server you will  only  be able to talk POP or IMAP to the server.  There is  urlLink Ximian Connector™  for Microsoft Exchange™, which will let you utilize the most useful features of Exchange (office calendaring, resource scheduling, etc...).  Alas it is only for the supported (read: linux) distributions.  Ximian supports Yellow Dog, but I can't find any information about PPC support for Connector.
 
 
So, for those of you tied to Outlook, you should first find out if Outlook is tied to Exchange.  If it is, Evolution on Mac OS X isn't the solution for you.  In fact, I don't think Evolution on Mac OS X is the solution to anything right now as there are a number of very capable e-mail clients available.  But if you need to talk to Exchange you will need to wait until Microsoft Entourage  urlLink supports  Exchange.  Of course, the rumors are that only Exchange 2000 will be supported and not 5.5.  Personally I doubt that.  True it would be a very Microsoft thing to do, ensuring more people going down the upgrade path.  But in reality the number of mac users in an organization probably wouldn't be able to squeak enough to get the grease that would be an upgrade to Exchange 2000.  Plus, Outlook 2001 for Mac already talks to Exchange 5.5.
 
 
It's all just speculation and rumors at this point though, especially since Exchange 2003 is getting ready to be rolled out.  Boy, I can't really express how happy I am not to be an Exchange admin right now.   urlLink Discuss

       Apple plans to debut an on-line music service for iPod users:
 
The new service, developed by Apple Computer, offers Macintosh users many of the same capabilities that are already available from services previously endorsed by the labels. But the Apple offering won over music executives because it makes buying and downloading music as simple and nontechnical as buying a book from Amazon.com, one source said.
 
``This is exactly what the music industry has been waiting for,'' said one person familiar with the negotiations between the Cupertino computer maker and the labels. ``It's hip. It's quick. It's easy. If people on the Internet are actually interested in buying music, not just stealing it, this is the answer.''

       This posting, mostly about  rsync , is aimed at people like me -- web developers who migrated to OS X with little experience in actually running web servers. I did it almost two years ago and am still learning.
  
I quickly came to enjoy, and rely on, having a local Apache/MySQL/PHP environment for development, but found that once a site went live I became more tied to the production server than I wanted. It was slowing me down, too, because of the workarounds needed to 1) keep work in progress isolated from live code and 2) integrate that work when testing was complete.
  
To remedy that situation I've been using rsync, with great success.  I set up offline mirrors of live sites I'm working on, complete with their own MySQL databases and local-only virtual domains (e.g. "bigfancyclient.dev"). I tweak code with abandon and then, when it's all working perfectly (ahem), I upload the changes to the production server in one step -- using a shell script containing a couple long-ass rsync commandlines.
  
For those new to rsync, basically my rsync commands say: "here's the development mirror A; here's the live server B; take every file in the following directories on A that's newer than its counterpart on B and upload it, saving the old one as a backup."
  
Sometimes even a "simple" change involves interdependent changes to half a dozen files in different directories. I don't have to keep track. rsync finds them all. I also have a "dry run" version that has the same commands with the addition of the "-n" option that does everything except actually transfer the files -- for a last-minute sanity check.
  
(Note 1: In theory you could accomplish the same thing by just uploading everything, but in practice this doesn't work except with very small sites.  And if you get around this by selecting which directories or files to upload, well, then you are manually doing the work that rsync can do faster and more accurately.)
  
(Note 2: This is clearly best suited to smaller operations.  With many developers working at once, you want something like CVS. Though rsync can of course sync in either direction, so I can update my mirrors when other developers or HTML coders make changes to the live server.)
  
rsync has a jillion options, so if this sounds at all appealing I encourage you to curl up with the manpage.
  
I have used lots of other methods for making code changes to live sites; for efficiency, ease, and safety this beats them all hands down.

       Kip Knight of Prism Research has responded to my criticism of Perfect Encryption, his software encryption suite (see a couple of posts below). As promised, his response verbatim:
 
Hit me hard and heavy!   Yes, I do have the credentials and knowledge of encryption (Ph.D. candidate).   Yes, I realize I'm stepping on 90 year-old theories.   Yes, I realize I'm putting the cart before the horse.   I'm trying to balance the Catch-22 problem of not trusting a hidden algorithm while hiding a very powerful algorithm from all those terrorist groups floating the Internet.   Let me explain some of the properties of my Many-Time Pad (MTP) algorithm.
 
MTP has the same key management issues as the OTP.   That is, the key must be at least as big as the plaintext.   The 32MB was arbitrary for the average user.   A command-line tool is provided that can create a key of any size ( 
If the OTP key is reused, the plaintext is wholly compromised.   If the MTP key is reused, the risk is highly diminished.   The key can be used for "many times", not forever.   For MTP, the probability of finding the entire key when the plaintext and the ciphertext are known equals the probability of finding the key without any a-priori knowledge.   That is the only probability law the Many-Time Pad has overcome and that the OTP fails.   If two sets of plaintext/ciphertext pairs are stolen, a small amount of information (as of yet undetermined) about the key is obtained.   Eventually, if enough pairs are stolen, enough about the key is found to make it compromised.
 
So, the MTP has only one advantage over the OTP, that is reuse of the key for "many times".
 
I know, I haven't divulged the algorithm yet.   The BIS has given me a 30 day review (took 2 months) which allows the mass market product for export under ECCN 5D992.   The agreement does not allow the algorithm to be stated on the Web.   The agreement does not allow me to provide source code on the Web.   I'm going to take the responsible high road and comply with the spirit of the international Wassenaar agreement to not give terrorists any sensitive technology.   Disclosure of the algorithm will be given to those purchasers that do not originate from terrorist labeled countries.   Slam me if you must but the algorithm can be dealt with however their conscience feels when they purchase the product from me.   Except for Sudan, Libya, Iraq, North Korea, ...

       After writing that last post I got to thinking: that didn't end on a very positive note, did it?  What would I recommend if you want to add some security to your Mac? That depends on what you want to do. 
 
For securing files on your computer I suggest using Disk Copy (from Apple) to create an encrypted disk image upon which you then store your files. It basically takes a chunk of your hard drive, treats it like a separate drive and encrypts everything in that chunk.
 
For encrypting email the  urlLink MacGPG  project is coming along quite nicely. It does, however, require some comfort with the command line and the UI of some of the elements leave a lot to be desired. I'd recommend installing MacGPG and then the following email utils and then forgetting about it. There's also quite an active  urlLink mailing list  available.
 
To use GPG with Mail.app you'll want  urlLink GPGMail .
 
To use GPG with Entourage you'll want  urlLink EntourageGPG . Note that in both cases, for Mail.app and Entourage, you need to have installed and configured MacGPG first.
 
For securely shredding files under X... I don't know. If you've got any suggestions for an app that works well, securely and doesn't causes file system trauma let me know.  urlLink Discuss

       Usually I wouldn't deign to slam someone else's software publicly but in the case of  urlLink Perfect Encryption 1.0  I think a load of debunking is in order. I'm going to give the developer the benefit of the doubt and just assume they've just skipped Crypto 101 rather than assume they're trying to con people purposely.
 
 urlLink Prism Research  is offering, for $20 US, "a suite of tools designed around the first algorithm to exceed the security of the One-Time Pad". Bollocks. Do not download this software. Do not use this software. I happily admit I haven't bothered to do so - testing the strength of crypto software simply by using it is akin to trying to test the structural integrity of a bridge by walking across it a couple of time.
 
Instead I'll dissect their claims one-by-one and offer counterpoints to support my disagreement with their claims.
 
 1.  Before they provide the algorithm you must pay for their software. 
That's the hallmark of a scam to me. They claim to do this to abide by US export regulations but that's crap. If that were the case then no public crypto research would be underway. A simple submission to the Department of Commerce will get them  all the permission for export they need within one to four months. 
 
They also don't mention if in buying the software and thus receiving the algo if the owner is then prohibited from distributing the algo, but I suspect once they think of that they'll prohibit it. In a nutshell folks: never, ever, trust proprietary crypto algorithms. They're dangerous and I'd happily bet hard cash that they're fundamentally flawed.
 
 2.  More secure than a one-time pad. 
A one-time pad (OTP) is the only cryptographic implementation that can be proven to be 100% secure. When generated properly a OPT is a perfect scheme. Don't believe me? Good. I direct you to page 15 of "Applied Cryptography" by Bruce Scheier: "Believe it or not there is a perfect encryption scheme. It's called a one-time pad". But hey, Bruce could be wrong so as further proof I direct you to pages 192-193 of "Handbook of Applied Cryptography" by Alfred Menezes et al: "If the keystream of digits are generated independently and randomly, the Vernam cipher is called a one-time pad, and is unconditionally secure".
 
Prism's misunderstanding of the principals of a one-time pad seem to stem from a misunderstanding of how a one-time pad is used. On their site they present the steps for use of a one-time pad: take your plaintext, mash it with your key, create the cipher text. Want to read it? Take the cipher take, mash it with the key, get your plaintext back. Done. Prism suggests that: "It basically says, if an adversary has both the plaintext and the ciphertext, he will know what the key is" and yes, that's absolutely true. But even that's not important. What Prism seems to be misunderstanding in this is that it's called a  one-time  pad for a reason: you only use a particular key  once  and then toss it.
 
In the case they site above your adversary now knows everything: plaintext, cipher text, key. So? You want to send another message you use a new key. That they have the old one gives them absolutely no help in deciphering the new one. They're back to square one. This is fundamental to the use of the one-time pad: never, ever use the same key twice. If knowing the key to one message helps in deciphering the key to another then you're pad is fundamentally flawed. If your adversary has your pad of keys you don't have a cryptographic issue, you have a  human resources issue.
 
 3.  I have to quote this one verbatim: "the algorithm eliminates the one-time nature of the OTP. Therefore, the only possible way to crack a cipher that uses the MTP is to physically steal the key". 
Those two statements make absolutely no sense together; one cannot beget the other. The one-time nature of the one-time pad is what makes it a perfect system. And theft of the key is actually the only valid attack against a one-time pad system (assuming one-time use of the keys); every other cryptographic system to date (that I'm aware of) has had at least one proposed theoretical attack levied against it, and most have had real-world practical attacks levied against them. I really doubt that Prism's system is any better.
 
 4.  Produce a 32 MB key file 
My initial reaction to this was WTF? If there's one thing you take from this about cryptographic keys it should be this: size doesn't matter, much. Any algo that makes claims to its security based solely on key size should be discounted. Strength through size is a function of the algorithm used, size alone does not and cannot guarantee strength. Without knowing the alogorithm its impossible to know how the key size relates in Prism's case but know this: a key that's 32 megs is likely just a major waste of drive space.
 
 5.  Shred files 55 times  
A number of fine Mac apps have provided this feature in the past, I don't have a problem with this from a cryptographic perspective but that they've included this functionality without understanding the basics of everything else worries me. I wouldn't trust these folks within 20 feet of my computer, much less with something so fundamentally sensative as doing multiple-sector wipes of my harddrive. Do you still feel confident trusting this software with the deletion of your critical files?
 
I think I've gone on longer than I intended to for this. I'm using Prism as a bit of a whipping boy to get a point across, a point that may best be summed up in the word of Bruce Schneier:
 
 
"Anyone who creates his or her own cryptographic primitive is either 
a genius or a fool. Given the genius/fool ratio for our species, the odds 
aren't very good." 
 - Bruce Schneier
 
I invite the folks at Prism to rebuke all my claims and evidence at their leisure. I'll happily post verbatim any response they'd care to make. I also invite them to send me their algorithm so I can pass it along to smarter folks than I for some independent analysis. And if they're worried about being busted by the Feds for public disclosure I'll happily take the heat and post it for them on mine own website, free of charge.

       Apple has released an  urlLink AppleWorks 6.2.7 updater . 
 
 
 This free update to AppleWorks for Mac OS X provides improvements to the presentation module, AppleScript, web content searching, printing, label printing, table support, and spell checking with user added words. The update provides better recognition and handling of Office 97 and Office 2000 files, improved support for multimedia files in database documents, improved web template downloading over slow internet connections, improved spreadsheet module--including Auto-Calculation, as well as enhanced support for documents which contain links. This version also supports web based templates and clipart on networks using proxy servers.

       OK, I'm even more of a Safari fan now. (FWIW, it has been my default browser for a long time, but somewhat grudgingly.) After reading the past two days of  urlLink Safari reports on Macintouch , I can see that lots of things are being ironed out. One thing that I haven't seen anyone comment on is printing. The new beta prints fine. There was a problem for some people (including me) that the first beta would split text lines at page breaks, which meant that I had to flop over to IE to print; no more.
 
And I'm starting to warm up to tabs, which is difficult because I'm the kind of person who doesn't mind a zillion open Safari windows and cycling through them with the splat-` key. I can see the value of tabs, but they still don't seem as natural to me as multiple windows. I am glad that they are available to the people who love them, and I assume I'll use them at least occasionally.
 
On a related topic, thank you to the readers of this blog for sending me mail about tabs. My previous message was meant to get some of the other posters here to post why they like tabs, but since they didn't, a handful of you were nice enough to send your comments to me directly.

       Well, if they did it for me, they missed. The  urlLink Al Jazeera site  still has the same problems. I got a few messages about my previous post, one which pointed out that the Al Jazeera site (and a handful of other interesting sites) are a jumble of Microsoft-centric cruft, so it is no surprise that anything other than IE cannot display them correctly.
 
And can someone explain the so-highly lauded  tabs  thing here? I have never used a tabs-driven browser, and even after turning them on in the new Safari, I can't figure out how to fly them. I can't be the only one who has just a single tab there all the time, wondering why this is worth the flamage that we saw for the past few months...

       No doubt in response to Paul H's last post, Apple has released a new  urlLink Safari  beta, available via Software Update or the Apple site. (Ironically, Blogger Pro doesn't support it so I'm making this entry in Camino.) One word:  tabs .  Already I like two things about their tab implementation (one: fast switching; two: tab bar can be made to persist even with just one tab) and hate two things ( one: external URL open events create new windows, not new tabs ; two: tabs can't be dragged between windows). Aside from tabs, one notable new feature is "privacy reset" which clears out  history, cache, download history, cookies, Google searches, and autofill text in one fell swoop. Nice.  urlLink Discuss

       Sometimes the rendering problems in Safari don't seem so bad, sometimes they do. I haven't been reading too much news about the Current Situation other than on the BBC, but I just went to the  urlLink Al Jazeera coverage of Iraq . The front page renders fine, but all the linked news comes up with a headline but no body. As usual, those pages render fine in IE.
 
Hasn't it been a couple of months since the last  urlLink update to Safari ? We keep  urlLink hearing how many improvements they're making ; can't we see them too?

       UNIX sysdadmin Mike Knell is conducting a little survey of UNIX people who have been using OS X. (Replies should go to the e-mail address given in his message.)

 
 Having bought an iBook just after Christmas due to the fantastic UNIXness of
 MacOS X, I've noticed that there are a lot of people in the UNIX admin world
 who seem to have been sprouting Macs over the last year or so since OS X
 became, uh, usable, and in particular a lot of people on sage-members are
 mentioning OS X these days.
 
 I thought I might do a little survey to see how prevalent this actually is,
 so if you're one of those UNIX people who's started using a Mac since the OS
 X fuss started, it'd be interesting if you could drop me some mail at
 mpk@uffish.net with some or all of the following information:
 
 1) What machine you bought
 2) When you bought it
 3) Why you bought it (i.e. "It runs UNIX and it's cool!")
 4) What platform you would have previously used for the application you now
    use a Mac for (i.e. "Linux on a Toshiba laptop")
 5) Whether you plan on buying any more Macs - or do you just have the one
    machine for the curiosity value?
 
 For instance, in my case:
 
 1) iBook 800MHz
 2) December 2002
 3) It runs UNIX and it's cool!
 4) Windows or FreeBSD
 5) A G4 PowerMac, sometime when I can afford it.
 
 Add any other free-form comments you care to, and I'll quote the interesting
 ones in the results.
 
 Please reply directly to me to avoid spamming the list - I'll summarise the
 responses to the list. Feel free to pass this mail on to anyone who'd not on
 the list but who might be a likely respondent. I'll probably expand this to
 a web-based survey if the results are intriguing enough..

       I've hacked together a little search proxy,  urlLink lazysearch.php , out of frustration at Safari's lack of a Mozilla/Camino-style bookmark "keywords" feature. It was also inspired by  urlLink  a recent entry at MacOSXHints.com . 
   
So what does it do? Basically it allows you to enter search queries like "s/foobar" (to search for "foobar" on google) or "s/n/apple" (to search for "apple" on google news) right into the location box of your browser.  Because it's implemented at a system level, it should automatically work in all browsers on your system, unless they are too clever for their own good.
  
 This requires that you are comfortable with a little Netinfo and Apache configuration. If you want to customize the script, you'll need to edit strings in the PHP source. I'm definitely looking for feedback and suggestions. Enjoy!  urlLink Discuss

       Since e-mail clients and spam filtering options are always of interest to migrators, it's worth mentioning that there is a  urlLink Eudora 6.0 beta  available now (Mac only, interestingly) that has built-in spam filtering. I've been using it for several days and am very impressed. 
  
Leaving aside minor new stuff like the mysterious "Content Concentrator," the big deal is spam filtering. It seems to incorporate some combination of header-scanning and Bayesian keyword filtering.  (If you have inside info on the specifics, please post!)  It works quite well out of the box with no explicit training. Results for my first three days and 1200 messages are very good -- it's catching 97.5% of my spam. Giving it feedback on what's spam and what isn't is easy (you can assign the Junk/Not Junk commands to function keys). Filtering is virtually instantaneous. Old stuff in the "Junk" mailbox can be automatically cleaned out after X days. Plus, they fixed the crazy memory leaks I was seeing with 5.2. No detectable stability problems. This is the most hassle-free and effective spam filtering I have ever used. Just say No to endlessly tweaking spam filter rules.  urlLink Discuss

         Welcome  urlLink Mailsmith 2.0 !  

 
I  still  don't see IMAP on the  urlLink list of features .  You do get built-in support for PGP 8 and Apple Address Book though, while very cool...it still isn't enough to get me to jump.
 
 
Why do I have to  have  IMAP?  I read my mail from at least four different locations and POP just sucks for that.  But isn't IMAP just like using POP but leaving the message on the server?  No.  Server side folders are the main IMAP feature that I can't live without.
 
 
Anyway, I'm grabbing the  urlLink demo  now and I'll let you know if they stuck IMAP in as an easter egg.
 
 
 Update:  No sooner had I hit publish than I looked up to see that  urlLink Daring Fireball  had posted a note on the new Mailsmith as well.  John mentions that IMAP people tend to throw a hissy fit (I hope I didn't come across that way) when they find out that IMAP still isn't in Mailsmith.  He thinks that it's a strange thing to take personally.  Me, I think it's a testament to how much people love products (read: BBEdit) from BareBones and  want  to use Mailsmith, but  can't .  John even points out, perhaps adding insult to injury, that if you don't use Mailsmith you are missing out on a "crackerjack email client."

          urlLink AAPL Gets an Upgrade   
 
While not juicy technical news, it is nice to once again get the "analysts" to see that the iPod is a killer piece of hardware.  It's sales are very important to Apple right now.  Not only are the most likely contributing to increased system sales, people are still buying tracks from the iTunes Music Service at about a clip of 500k/week.  Not bad.
 
 
The  other  main reason AAPL got a boost is that it was bringing iTunes to Windows.  Truth be told, it's a freakin' huge market.  "Apple is abandoning its long-standing strategy of confining its award-winning software to the Mac platform," said  Charles R. Wolf .

        And now a Cult of LaunchBar&trade; update:  urlLink 3.2.12  has been released and it has some minor updates, but one that I feel is important. 
 
 The "Default Web Browser" and "Default Email Reader" preference settings have been removed. Please use the corresponding settings in System Preferences instead, or use the "Open with Application" setting of your LaunchBar configuration. 
 
 
It's nice to see apps, especially one as vital to me as LaunchBar, use things in the OS that make  their  life easier to make  my  life easier.  It is such a pain to have every app have it's own way of figuring out what the default net app is.  Remember the days before Internet Config?

        In response to customer demands (and many long discussions on the  urlLink REALBasic  mailing list), REAL Software has  urlLink announced that RB 5.5 will be capable of cross-compiling apps for Red Hat and SuSE distributions of Linux,  with other distros being added according to demand. You'll still need either a Mac or Windows box to create and cross-compile the app for Linux. You'll have to wait for the Linux-based REALBasic IDE, but REAL Software says that they intend to make one available in a later version.  RB 5.5 is expected to be released in the first quarter of 2004.

       I was having some problems with Mail.app and it's handling of cached IMAP folders.  When I would delete all of the messages in a folder, then when I tried to view new messages it would still display old messages that I had deleted from the server.  The issue seemed to be that the folders were missing the "special" message that is in all IMAP folders.  I had been using mutt and procmail for quite some time before I switched to IMAP, hence none of my folders had the special message that helps keep IMAP clients on the straight and narrow.  So if you are seeing odd caching bugs, try deleting the folder and re-creating it through the Mail.app interface, especially if they were just procmail mbox files.

       I'm wondering if Panther fixes any of OS X's subtle, but annoying and
persistent, problems with monitor-spanning.   (For the record, while this is a gripe post, in general I  love  how easy OS X makes monitor-spanning. I consider it indispensible.)
  
I use two displays vertically stacked (my PB internal below and a 17"
CRT above, for a 1152x1638 desktop).  A lot of these problems are much
more noticeable with this kind of setup, which I can only surmise
 has never been used by any OS X developer inside Apple.
  
A couple examples:
   with the menubar on the top monitor, open Clock.  Drag it to the
bottom.  Now drag back to the top. Oops, you can't!
  with the menubar on the bottom monitor, open any Cocoa app on the
bottom.  try to drag its window to the top.  Oops, you can't!  (There
may be Cocoa apps that don't do this and Carbon ones that do, but none
that I've tried.)
 
Anybody running a Panther preview that can check these? Just curious. (Also, for the record, I did report this bug to Apple a couple months back -- the Clock example at least. Haven't heard anything yet...)  urlLink Discuss

       do you know how butt-simple it is to back up your  urlLink tibook ?  when i reinstalled my lapdog last, i tried out UFS -- i really wanted to use UFS instead of HFS+ as i was entralled by the possibility of seeing everything in the clear on the command line instead of it being hidden in the resource fork.  unfortunately, UFS seemed slower on my box and apps like  urlLink virtual pc  were a no-go.  but i digress. 

backing up and restoring on my box were really simple.  i plugged in my 30GB  urlLink ipod  and installed  urlLink os x  on it (which went smoothly, i just selected it as the drive to install to when the installer asked me).  then with a few points and clicks, i got disk copy to create an image of my powerbook's drive and save it to my ipod.  click, click, reboot while holding down "T" (to boot firewire target mode) -- instead of your laptop's drive whirring you'll hear the ipod happily clicking away.  perfect.  when booted, format your laptop's drive, then expand out the image onto the notebook's drive, and voila. 

jeez.  i remember the hassles i would go through before on my other computers.  this is just too easy.  to make it even easier, the  urlLink carbon copy cloner  will even schedule the creation of disk images!  if anything goes wrong with your laptop, its your fault.  these people just make it too easy. 

 update (7/21/03 23:34) : oops, thanks to adam sherman to pointing out that i left out  how  to restore the disk image to the hard drive.  use bombich's carbon copy cloner for that.

       i've been going through the its-the-end-of-the-summer-so-lets-secure-the-house-network fiasco.  my home network is managed by one firewall linux box that has three NICs in it -- one for the outside world, one for my wired network, and one for my wireless network.  the wireless network is fully open, but it is firewalled off and cannot see the wired network at all.  what i wanted was a vpn solution that would let me log onto the network from my  urlLink tibook  and get an encrypted link into my wired network. 

i've been tinkering with  urlLink openvpn  as my vpn solution.  it really works well even when both ends obtain their IP addresses from a DHCP server and instead of doing something funky as most vpn inplementations does, this actually sets up a virtual interface  tun0  on your box that you can send packets back and forth through.  after setting it up on the firewall box, i followed pfisterer's  urlLink os x  instructions and after manging the routing table with the following  route  command 

 route add -net 10.0.0.0/255.255.255.0 192.168.2.2  

i got all the packets destined for 10.0.0.0/24 on my  urlLink tibook  to route over  tun0  and into my wired network just perfectly.  now if only somebody made a nicer interface so i didn't have to do everything using  sudo  on the command line...  free, kick-butt software!

        I only use one news aggregator these days,  urlLink NetNewsWire .  Brent Simmons has just released another  urlLink beta of the 1.0.4 version .  This is the pay version of NNW.  There is still  urlLink NetNewsWire Lite  which is free. 

  The number of features that have been packed into this beta is truly astounding.  The biggest is probably that NNW has switched over to  urlLink Web Kit , so all the content encoded feeds render very nicely.  Aaron Swartz's htmlDiff has been integrated.  It's faster.  It has more keyboard shortcuts than you can shake a 17" Powerbook at.  It even has gzip support for servers that can send out gzip compressed files. 

 One of the best things is that development is fairly open.  By that I mean that Brent is willing to listen to people and you can see from his release notes where ideas come from and you almost get a feel for how fast they get integrated into NNW. 
 
 Update:  The  urlLink final 1.0.4 version  (3.0 MB) is out.

       For the most part I've never bothered to pay attention to the Scripts menu in any application that has them. It's been my experience that most of the included AppleScripts tend to simply mimick behaviour easier accomplished through keyboard shortcuts and plain ol' typing. But sometimes, just sometimes, a script comes along that makes the Scripts menu absolutely worthwhile.
 
 urlLink BBAutoComplete  is just that sort of script. It, as the name suggests, adds look-ahead auto-completion to BBEdit (and a host of other applications I don't use - see for yourself).
 
After installation I gave it a try by typing:
 spaceman spacestation  
then on the next line I typed 
 spa  
and pressed Cmd-/ (the keyboard shortcut for it). Lo and behold, it completed  spacestation . Cmd-/ again and it completed  spaceman .
 
Sweet.

       A friend of mine from Apple tipped me off to a cheap-and-easy way of improving the performance of Mail.app, the mailer built into OS X. I've found that every time I send a message, Mail freezes up and the statusbar says, "Adding recipients to Address Book." Turns out that you can really cut down on this delay by forcing your Address Book to compress itself:

 

  Open Address Book

  Create 10 or more entries

  Delete your new entries

  Quit Address Book

 

For extra speedy goodness, try deleting the ~/Library/Application Support/Address Book/ABPerson.index" file, then opening Address Book and searching for an entry. This will force a rebuild of the Address Book index, too.
 
I've tried it, and it worked beautifully for me. What's more, it seems to have improved the performance of iSync for synching with PalmOS and iPod.

       On the theme of migration, I thought I'd post about an unexpected, probably temporary, migration I made this afternoon -- I'm posting this from the Konqueror web browser, on a machine running  urlLink KDE  on  urlLink FreeBSD  on  urlLink Intel  hardware.
 
My first-gen PowerBook G4 (500MHz) has served me incredibly well, but it is nearing the end of its service life, with vertical lines on the display and freezes galore.  Yes, I should have bought AppleCare  :P  Today I just couldn't take one more freeze. I dragged the FreeBSD machine, which had been a headless development box, over here to my desk and plugged it into my monitor. 
 
I know this probably isn't going to last. For one thing, I hate desktops, and love laptops. If I made this a longer-term adventure I'd be looking to get me a nice sub-4-pound wintel laptop on eBay. But for now (i.e. while I deal with selling my old PowerBook and buying its replacement), I'm enthused and I think it's going to be very interesting.
 
I in terms of bang for the buck my "new" machine is quite tremendous. Apple can't touch that. The OS, desktop environment, and all the apps I'm using are free -- and quite current -- and the 333MHz/128M/10GB/CD-R Pentium II tower cost me $60 at a yard sale. 
 
One irony that strikes me is that I never would have done this if I hadn't been using OS X for the past 2+ years. Apple did a tremendous job of making the OS perfectly usable and tidy while leaving the Unix clockwork there for inquisitive souls to play with. So now I know enough to really be dangerous. I've been using FreeBSD on web servers for years, but this is my first foray into the non-OS X Unix desktop world.
 
Random notes: There is a mind-blowing selection of software out there. The ports system is fantastic.  I'm using mostly stock KDE apps right now because that's what I have installed, but plan to move to Firebird for browsing and Thunderbird for mail. Being a web developer, I'm very intrigued by the Quanta Plus development environment, which looks like BBEdit on [insert drug of emphasis here].  My Kensington Expert Mouse Pro USB is plug-n-playing just fine, in left-handed mode no less. I like this old-style tactile feedback keyboard. I like the "Klipper" multiple clipboard.  I miss Quartz, especially the text. I miss the Keychain, imperfect though it may be. I miss Launchbar bad. Really bad. 
 
Finally, while the  feel  of the UI is of course not as nice as Apple's in most respects, the  mood  is very fine -- and by that I mean that nothing on this machine is trying to sell me something else. I like that. A lot. I'm not being endlessly pestered to upgrade to Quicktime 17, or get a .mac account, or open my MSN Wallet, or pay my shareware fees.  I'm free, baby, and it feels good.   urlLink Discuss

       In looking for OS X tidbits to add to my  urlLink lazysearch  script, I came across  /usr/share/calendar , which is full of "today in history" type stuff. This is already there in every stock OS X install, one of the weird bits of BSD detritus. Anyway, I added the following line to my .login file (actually, ~/Library/init/tcsh/login.mine if you must know):
 
cat /usr/share/calendar/* | grep `date +"%m/%d"`                                          
 
Note the backticks around the date command, which tell the shell to actually use the output of that command as an argument for grep.
Today's output (you can see there are a few rough edges):
 
09/20   Upton (Beall) Sinclair born, 1878
09/20   Harlan Herrick runs first FORTRAN program, 1954

       I've started a page that catalogues applications that use or require MySQL to operate:  urlLink OS X Apps that Use MySQL . I'd really like Apple to include MySQL as part of the default install (I'm sure they can come to an agreement with  urlLink MySQL AB  over licensing if they really wanted to) but until that time it's up to the end-user to do it for themselves.
 
My thinking is: the more quality reasons to do it, the more likely users are to make the effort to get it done. If you've got an OS X app that uses MySQL,  urlLink drop me a line  and I'll add it to the page.  urlLink Discuss

        Extended iCal rant from a timezone warrior 
 
Apple's iCal has an unbelievably annoying, poorly thought-out system for handling timezone changes. Here's how it works: when you change the timezone of your system-clock, it adjusts all of your calendar items, so if you go from Pacific to Eastern time, you noon lunch appointment is "fixed" so that it shows up at 3PM -- the Eastern equivalent of 12PM Pacific.
 
What is the use-case for this? If I'm in San Francisco and I'm going to Toronto in a week and I make a 6PM dinner appointment with my brother and sister-in-law, should I enter it as a 3PM appointment, knowing that my computer will adjust this to 6PM when I land in Toronto and change my system clock? And if I do, how do I avoid double-booking myself when someone else asks me to have dinner at the same time and my calendar shows that 6PM isn't booked, that's fine?
 
In other words, why does Apple think I want to use Greenwich Mean Time, rather than my internal, subjective frame-of-reference, as my clock?
 
Now, Apple has updated iCal with a "switch timezones off" feature. Which doesn't work.
 
Here's how it doesn't work: Create an appointment with timezone "support" switched off. Make it from noon to 1PM. Now, go to your system clock and change your timezone to one hour back. The appointment will shift back by one hour. That's with timezone "support"  switched off .
 
If you switch the "support" on and change timezones, iCal will ask you if you want to change the timezone "display" for your appointments. Answering "no" seems to solve the problem, as all of your events will stay localized for whatever timezone you were in when you created them. What's more, whenever you create an event, it gives you the option of specifying a timezone for it and adjusts it on your behalf -- so if you create a 12PM appointment while in EST and specify that its timezone is PST, iCal will move the event back to 9AM for you. 
 
This stinks. For starters, that's all well and good when you and I make a lunch date for noon next week in New York, but it falls down when you call me back an hour later and ask me if we can make it brunch at 2PM -- now I have to go into iCal and work out that my noon-Eastern/9AM-Pacific appointment is really a 2PM-Eastern/11AM-Pacific appointment and, rather than simply bumping a noon appointment to 2PM, I need to subtract three and move a 9AM appointment to 11AM.
 
It gets worse, though: say you use the timezone "support" and just don't worry about the timezones. All start/stop times stay as you entered them, provided you keep on clicking "no" every time you change zones and iCal asks you if you want to update your display. So far so good. But woe betide you if you create an appointment with an  alarm  -- your 9AM alarm will ring a 6AM when you're on the west coast (if you created it while your clock was set Eastern), even though it will show up as a 9AM alarm in your calendar.  There's  a user-hostile design decision!
 
It gets  even worse : Just wait until you synch iCal with your PalmOS device! Last night, I moved from Mountain to Central time. I adjusted the time-zone on my Clie and my Powerbook, but asked iCal to leave all my appointments in Mountain time. Then I made the mistake of synching my Clie: iSync decided that all the appointments in my Clie were an hour behind, and moved them up an hour -- including my wake-up alarm and the alarm for my 8:30AM conference call (Thanks, Apple!).
 
I have toyed with the idea of leaving my timezone set to GMT or some arbitrary value, and then spoofing my clock by manually setting it forward or back whenever I get off an airplane, but this royally screws up your email (which arrives at the remote end with bogus timestamps that indicates that it was sent hours in the past or the future, depending), and messes up any kind of incremental backup that uses change-dates to determine which version of a file to overwrite.
 
So, after all that whingeing, I have a solution of sorts. I used to use an app called "iCalTimeZoneFixer" that would automatically adjust your calendar items when you changed timezones, undoing the damage wrought by Apple's system. But with Panther and the new iCal, this doesn't work so good anymore: about 70% of the time, running iCalTimeZoneFixer deletes all the items in my calendar.
 
So this morning, while I was missing my phone call because my alarm hadn't gone off, I figured out a fix of sorts. It hinges on the fact that your iCal calendar file (which you'll find in ~/Library/Calendars/$CALENDARNAME.ics") is a flat text file, that you can edit with a text-editor like BBEdit. 
 
1. Quit iCal, then make a copy of your calendar file. Open your calendar file in a text-editor (I used BBEdit)
 
2. Look for the string that denotes the city/timezone your calendar is localized to, i.e. "America/Chicago" or "America/San Francisco"
 
3. Go to System Preferences -> Date and Time -> Time Zone and use the map interface to find out the name of your desired timezone (i.e., if you're in America/San Francisco on your way to America/Denver, America/Denver is your desired timezone)
 
4. Search-and-replace the existing timezone string with your desired timezone and save
 
5. Start iCal up again, then go back to System Peferences -> Date and Time -> Time Zone and change your timezone. iCal will "adjust" your calendar and you'll find yourself looking at the correct times again
 
There you have it: using a text-editor and search-and-replace, you can undo the stupidest feature I've ever seen in a calendar app.

        Using GNU Privacy Guard with Mail.app just got a lot better.

       After many weeks in the FreeBSD wilderness, I have migrated back to OS X aboard a 12" aluminum PowerBook.   I plan on detailing my time in exile in a future post, complete with screen shots and bullet points.  Right now, I just want to note what an excellent piece of hardware this machine is compared to my previous PB, a  urlLink 500MHz Titanium . That thing scratched like a CD and was as floppy as a phone book. Granted, I tend to be hard on computers, but dammit, portable computers should be designed to be ported, and not require sheepskin swaddling and leather screen-protectors and  urlLink ultra high impact copolymer resin cases  (as cool as those things may be, especially ultra high impact copolymer resin).   There's hardly a speck of paint on this entire computer, and in nearly three weeks of use I have yet to put a single scratch or mark on it -- whereas usually the first ding is inflicted within 24 hours. Hell, even the  trackpad button  is aluminum!  One of the dumb flaws of the titanium was the plastic frame between the upper and lower cases. Thousands of anal-retentive Titanium PB owners shat their pants as they noticed their wrists had worn the paint down to the decidedly un-titanium black plastic underneath. On the 12" there's a small grey plastic seam around the edges of the lid and base, and I'll bet like five dollars that it is solid-color plastic all the way through. 
  The silver keys I'm less confident about -- time will tell.  But at least they're not translucent, so I don't have to stare at the eyelashes and other detritus trapped underneath them. Maybe I wasn't sufficiently antiseptic to own a machine like the Titanium.  All I know is, the 12" is  tight .

       I just noticed that Mark Liyanage has written an OS X book: "Mac OS X "Panther" Timesaving Techniques for Dummies" ( urlLink Amazon ). If you've got questions about Panther this might very well be worth checking out. Mark is one of those guy's who's achieved 'guru' status with OS X, consistently putting out the best LAMP and Unix  urlLink app packages  available.

       When I told my friend David I was upgrading to Panther, he asked "why?". Good question. Mostly, it was for the better Finder interface, but also because many people reported that 10.3 felt faster.  urlLink This benchmark site  confirms that 10.3 is a bit faster in most areas.
 
BTW, the new Finder interface (with the sidebar and Expos&eacute;) really is quite spiffy. Maybe not $129 spiffy, but much better than the Old Way. And, to my taste, better than any of the Finder-replacement applications that I had tried over the last year.

       More Unixy goodness. First, James Stansfield wrote to point out that:
 
 sudo apachectl configtest  
The above command works wonders as well... This can be run when apache is running
 
Second: a friend is looking for answers to the following:
 
Any idea how to set permissions permanently in  /dev/ ?
 
It's not a disk filesystem, so any changes you make are lost on reboot,
and I want to change the perms of  /dev/bpf*  so I can run tcpdump as
myself.
 
I've only found one reference, some guy on mailing list suggesting that
apple's DevFS is old, and doesn't allow configuration of device
permissions.
 
Any ideas? I can make tcpdump setuid root, but I've built 3 versions in
the last 2 days, and there seems something wrong about having to do
that (not the building, the setuid rooting).
 
Anyone?  urlLink Discuss

       Ah, welcome back Forwarding Address. Sorry I've been away so long.
 
So, about Jenson's Cocoa license issue. It's not perfectly clear to me, but there's no license on Cocoa  per se  other than any Cocoa specific agreement you might assent to when agreeing to the Apple Developer Tools license (and there or may not be anything Cocoa-related in there, I haven't checked lately). Broadly, Apple can't revoke your right to use or link to Cocoa in your applications unless you violate some agreement. If the Developer Tools license agreement says nothing about your specific use of the tools and/or Cocoa, then you can't be held liable for doing something you didn't know and agree to knowing was not allowed.
 
Of course, IANAL, so I'm chasing this up, but I do work with a lot of intellectual property lawyers, and this is the general interpretation I get. Note that this is  entirely different  from agreeing to a license and then to have the licensor find you to be violating it, as was the case with Apple's iTunes SDK and iCommune a while back.

       Should you need to install  DBD::mysql  on Panther, here's a few tips you might find helpful. First:  DBD::mysql  installation will likely fail if you try to do it using the CPAN installer because it won't be configured with your database settings. You'll need to manually install it. Get it from CPAN here:  urlLink DBD-mysql-2.9003 .
 
To create the Makefile you'll need to pass it your database's  username  and  password :
 
 perl Makefile.PL --testuser=usename --testpassword=password 
 
Next you'll need to add the following step ( thanks to  urlLink Casey West  ):
 
 perl -pi -e's/MACOSX/env MACOSX/' Makefile 
 
 
I also had to  sudo make install  which makes the whole process like so:
  
perl Makefile.PL --testuser=username --testpassword=password 
perl -pi -e's/MACOSX/env MACOSX/' Makefile 
make 
make test 
sudo make install

       The founder of the GNU-Darwin project  urlLink wrote an interesting editorial  on Apple and open source today. I really appreciate that the GNU-Darwin project played a role in helping to make the  APSL  a better open source license.
  
In my opinion, Apple has made a lot of good progress (such as opening up Darwin, WebCore, and the Objective-C runtime under the APSL) but I do hope they'll go further and open up Cocoa under the APSL. Frequently when programming in Cocoa I remember that I have no significant rights since everything is still, as all of the Cocoa header files simply say, "Copyright 2003 Apple Computer. All Rights Reserved". I didn't use to care about that. Open source helped me realize that I can have rights, too. Apple's been gracious so far, I hope they continue to be. It's played a significant role in me buying and evangelizing Apple products.

       A friends recently took the plunge and installed MySQL but got a bit stumped when it came time to muck around with settings via the command line. Perhaps our exchange will be of use to others looking to do the same:
 
 
I've installed the  urlLink MySQL package  from Server Logistics and I'm real rusty in the
Terminal. I'm trying set the path so I don't have to type the entire string all the time.
 
Now I don't see a file called ".tcshrc" in my home directory so I need to
make one. Just call name the file with the extention? 
 
Yep, exactly. In Unix a file that starts with a period doesn't actually have an extension, the period tells the system that the file should be invisible (like the Finder's Invisible flag). This is used to hide configuration files from the user and works with any file (stick a period at the beginning of a JPEG's filename and it'll disappear from sight).
 
Before we go further, a few key unix commands you'll need:
 
 
 ls   Shows all the _visible_ files in a directory  
  ls -al   Shows _all_ the files in a directory, including the invisible ones 
 
 
 locate   Unix locate utility, much faster than the Finders and it'll find files the Finder won't (like .tcshrc) 
		Used like:  > locate .tcshrc 
		Returns: 	  > /Users/god/.tcshrc 
 
 
 pwd   Stands for "print working directory". Shows you the complete path to where you currently are
 
 Not to mention I get confused between /Users/myuser and /usr/local for "home
directory". It would be /Users/myuser, right? 
 
When docs refer to the Home directory, they means yours, in this case /Users/myuser. /usr/local is system-wide and probably not where you want to make these changes.
 
 Can I make this file using Pico? The Thomas Berger notes mention an app
called "vi" but running that in Terminal appears totally greek to me. 
 
Yes but the Unix geeks will laugh at you. Personally I like pico and use pico for all my cmd-line text editing because I've never been able to figure out how to use vi or vim or emacs and don't care to take the time to learn. Your choice of text editor appears to be a huge deal in the Unix world (go figgur). When unix geeks ask me and I say "pico" they laugh at me and then usually get into a shouting match with each other over vi vs. emacs.
 
I don't know how familiar you are with pico but none of the key commands are the same as any standard Mac app. The important ones:
 
 
 Saving: 		control-O (oh) 
 Quitting: 		control-X 
 Cancelling: 	control-C 
 
 
BTW, BBEdit's "Open Hidden..." feature is invaluable for this sort of thing too, as it'll let you open and edit text files normally invisible to GUI applications. pico's great for small stuff like this but for editing the likes of Apache's massive conf files nothin' beats BBEdit.
 
Finally, here's what my .tcshrc looks like so you have something to compare to:
 
 
setenv PATH "$PATH":/Library/MySQL/bin 
setenv PATH "$PATH":/Library/PostgreSQL/bin 
setenv LC_ALL C 
setenv CVSROOT "/usr/local/cvsrep"

Can anyone help my cousin Keith?

He installed Panther on his PowerBook, found it didn't play nice with some of his applications (he makes films and videos) and so re-installed Jaguar, using the Archive option, rather than doing a clean install.

So, how can he fix this? Is there a command he can type to into his terminal to, you know, er, sort of launch Jaguar the way you can launch applications? Or is he just totally buggered?

2. Let me define which properties of the email are displayed. I only need to see the  From:  and  Subject:  lines to know if it's worth reading or not.

       For those of you wondering about the speed of VirtualPC 6.1, I did a test. I got a copy of VirtualPC 6.1, I put FreeBSD (command-line only) on it, and used "openssl speed" to measure the CPU speed doing a reasonable mix of complex things that don't involve the disk. Virtual PC is almost exactly 20% as fast as the native CPU on my iBook G3 600 MHz. So, VirtualPC is probably reasonable for people who have to have one or two non-CPU-intensive Windows apps running sometimes, but not much more than that. They say there will be speed improvements in VirtualPC 7, but I'll believe that when I see it.

       A friend is having a problem with MPEG-2 video and Final Cut Pro. FA: OSX readers have thus far managed to answer almost every esoteric question posted here thus far so I figure this one ought'a be easy:
 
 I'm using a Mac G5 and Final Cut Pro. I have lots of video I edit directly from the DV camera and other video that has already been saved in MPEG-2 format. When I put the clips together I want to be able to use it in MPEG-2 so it works universally on any PC.
 
I have been having trouble editing MPEG-2 video on this system, however. When I import it into Final Cut, there is no audio track. I assume this is because on MPEG-2 the audio is interleaved but there should still be a way to convert it. I have the "Compressor" that comes with Final Cut which seems like it should be the way to do it but it can import anything but MPEG-2.
 
If you have any advice I'd appreciate it. I'm sure its a simple answer.

       A few months ago, a friend came to me with a broken cd-rom drive and a new copy of Panther. It occured to me that I could install Panther onto his machine by running the installer on my machine and targeting his hard drive mounted over FireWire. Thankfully, Apple hasn't crippled their OS with DRM otherwise this might not be possible. The first installer disk accepted the firewire drive but the second didn't, I had to copy it's contents onto the target drive and finish the installation locally.
  
Thank you, Apple.

       If you're like me and you do any PHP/Perl/MySQL development on your local machine then you probably spend a lot of time looking at your Apache error logs to determine what's gone wrong with your app. I used to use  tail /var/log/httpd/error_log  in a Terminal window to do this because it was nice and fast. Used to, that is, until I came across  urlLink GeekTool :
 
GeekTool is a PrefPane (System Preferences module) for Panther or Jaguar to show  system logs, unix commands output, or images (i.e. from the internet)  on your desktop (or even in front of all windows).
 
With GeekTool and Expose I have even faster access to my error log now: I use GeekTool to dump  error_log  to the desktop and have set the lower right corner to reveal the desktop in Expose. One-flick log viewing.
 
Here's how: 
1. Install GeekTool 
2. Create a new entry 
3. Add the path to your error log (in my case:  /var/log/httpd/error_log , probably yours too) 
4. Set the Location to x:10, y:22

iPhoto has come a long way since it debuted.  So far in fact that it skipped an
 entire  version number, 3.  But I'm not here to rehash iPhoto itself,
rather a couple of 3rd party enhancements that make iPhoto all that more useful.
 

 
The first is  urlLink iPhotoToGallery .  I'll admit that this is useful to me because I
use  urlLink Gallery  on my web server to manage my online photos and it will only be
useful to you if you do the same.  That being said, it's nice that iPhoto
has the ability to be extended like this.  Before this plug-in I had to export
the photos, then upload them, and finally do all the Gallery album
configurations.  Now I export directly from iPhoto to Gallery, doing all the
configuration in the plug-in interface.  Slick.  The newest version has Keychain
support and other security enhancing features.
 

 The second unfortunately isn't out yet, but it hooks iPhoto up to  urlLink Typepad using
the Atom API .  I don't have a Typepad account and I don't have the code, but
again I feel this is a very cool way to extend iPhoto.
 

 This by no means covers all the ways that iPhoto has been extended, just ways
that caught my fancy.  You can always  urlLink search VersionTracker , or your favorite mac update site for iPhoto goodies.
 

  By the way, does  anybody  know what the check mark keyword in iPhoto is for?  It adds a little icon to the thumbnail preview and I can't find out what significance it has.  Drop a note in the  urlLink QuickTopic  if you have any clues.

        For those of you using  urlLink GPGMail  to sign or encrypt your mail, you might want to check which version you are using.  An  urlLink update  (GPGMail 1.0.1 (v33)) sneaked past me late last year and it has some important fixes, like no longer leaving orphan GPGMEProxyServer processes on a quit or a crash.  I can't  prove  it, but I think this issue was causing me a lot of problems with Mail.app and since the update, all has been clear. 
 Then again, it could have been those darn flying elves...

       From the Some-News-Is-Bad-News Dept.: According to  urlLink brighthand.com , Palm (or Pa1mOne if you prefer) is  dropping support for the Mac . Palm Desktop has been atrophying for long enough that many people (including me) have switched over to iCal and Address Book, but that's not enough -- unless I'm missing something, there is now no plan for a general conduit architecture that runs on the Mac and works with PalmOS 6 ("Cobalt").  urlLink iSync  is dandy but it depends on the current Palm HotSync software to function.  urlLink The Missing Sync  is promised to work with PalmOS 6, but having to spend an extra $40 on an intrinsic function like sync is somewhat galling. Here's hoping Apple picks up the slack, or Palm  urlLink changes their minds .   urlLink Discuss

        From the  urlLink KDE 3.2 release : 
 
 Working in concert with Apple Computer Inc.'s Safari web browser team, KDE's web support has seen huge performance boosts as well as increased compliance with widely accepted web standards 
 
 Now while companies giving back is nothing new (Apache, Linux kernel,  et cetera ) it's still a good thing to see.  I remember there was a lot of suspicion towards the  urlLink original post  about Apple diving in to the code on the khtml list.  I haven't been following the developer list, but it sounds like things are going well.

        Todd Dominey of  urlLink What Do I Know  has  urlLink found  a potential competitor to LaunchBar:  urlLink QuickSilver . 

 Now being a dues-paying member of the Cult of LaunchBar&trade; I know this sounds like heresy.  It might very well be.  But the price to check out Quicksilver is very small.  Free in fact, for now at least.  The source isn't up yet, but it  urlLink will be .
 
 
But the crazy bit is that this is supposedly just the beginning.
 
 Quicksilver is an evolving structure for manipulating any form of data. 

 Regardless, it looks like LaunchBar is getting some competition.

       I wanted to post a little bit about using  urlLink Ogg Vorbis  under OS X. Vorbis is a patent-free, open format with better quality-to-size ratios than MP3. I searched the archives (thanks to Steve's recent addition of the Google search box at left) and found that it's been almost two years since  urlLink Chris's thorough post . It turns out that almost everything I wanted to mention is already in that post -- meaning, disappointingly, that there has not been a lot of movement with Vorbis and OS X in the past couple years. And we still don't have Vorbis encoding in iTunes, or Vorbis playback on the iPod.   So, what  is  new? There are some new players (e.g.  urlLink Whamb ). There are iPod alternatives that do play Vorbis files, most interesting among them being  urlLink Neuros . Most of the software Chris mentions has seen updates. I also recently discovered  urlLink tenc , which is rough but still makes ripping CDs less work than with Ogg Drop, and good enough to get me to temporarily abandon the oggenc wrapper I was working on. I've also exchanged some e-mail with the Ogg Drop developers, who are working on an exciting-sounding expansion of that app.

       Warning: tangent. A few FA:OSX bloggers are also denizens of  urlLink The Well , a 20-year-old virtual community based in San Francisco but with members around the world. I've been there for almost ten years myself. In fact, the Well's most excellent Mac conference is where I first heard news of this blog. It's also where I've exchanged information, tips, and frustrations about everything from emacs to Quark XPress to FileMaker Pro to OpenOffice.org. With an active population of Unix as well as Mac experts, we've got some great cross-pollination going on.  Katie Hafner's 1997 Wired mag article (all  urlLink 20,000 words of it ) famously dubbed the Well "the world's most influential online community" (as of 1997 at any rate). For a lighter take, see the  urlLink somewhat more recent set of first-person stories in Salon . But you don't have to read any of that stuff to see what the Well is about, and now I am getting around to the point of this post. During March, they're running a special offer -- join for $2, check it out for two months, and stay if you like. It's full of sharp people (double meaning intended -- smart and spiny both) and interesting discussions. In an era where every teen haX0r has his own free PHP bulletin board, you may wonder why it would be worth paying $10-$15 per month to type at other people. This is a great way to find out.   urlLink Link to more info on the special deal    urlLink Discuss

       Over on my blog I pointed out the reasons that, as a general rule,  urlLink I tend not to bother checking out version 1.x software  on  urlLink MacUpdate . Quite honestly 1.x software tends to be lacking.
 
Happily there are exceptions to this rule and  urlLink Curio  is one of them. Thanks go to  urlLink Adam  for pointing me to it. Competitively it's in the same space as  urlLink OmniGraffle  with some notable differences. Where OmniGraffle is quite clearly designed for chart making Curio is designed for much more free-form, creative brainstorming. My perfect app would be the offspring of the two.
 
I've been corresponding with the developers a bit, mainly requesting features, and they've been great at accepting suggestions and offering pointers on how to use it. My only real complaint about Curio is the price. $99 is pretty steep, all things considered. I can't help but wonder if the developers are setting the price based on the amount of effort it took to create Curio rather than as a reflection of the total value it offers to the user. 
 
That said, my experience with it and with the developers leaves me with little doubt that Curio will become an app worth $99 some day, I just hope it's sooner than later. If you're looking for a brainstorming/notetaking/designing app give  urlLink Curio  a look.

       Motivated by responses to the previous post, I decided to try installing mod_python along with apache2 via  urlLink DarwinPorts .  Had some trouble installing DarwinPorts itself, though, which turned out to be Fink-related. The key is to get the Fink bits out of your $PATH while building. I reset my $PATH to a nice simple "/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin". Otherwise, TCL-related problems will hang you up: "Tcl package directory not found. Please specify its location with --with-tclpackagedir." So, ignore that, fix your $PATH and re-run configure. (The real reason I'm posting this is that I suspect I will hit this same problem on a new machine in a year or so and won't remember how I fixed it...)

       I know I'm way behind the curve, since  urlLink Python  has popped up in many posts here in the past couple years, but I have renewed my acquaintance with this  urlLink sweet language  and am really enjoying it. I'm poring over the standard documentation,  urlLink Mark Pilgrim's book  and parts of the  urlLink "Think Like a Computer Scientist" book .   I'm sure there are readers out there who are Mac Python ninjas, and I'd love to hear from you in the Quicktopic. I'll share a few tidbits to get things rolling.  One: you can get a nice little search interface to the documentation by doing a "pydoc -g" under X11 (I've got it aliased to Cmd-shift-P in the X11 Applications menu). Two: while command history doesn't seem to work in the Apple-provided build, it works great in the Fink version (promise you won't make me feel like an idiot if there's some easy way to turn this on in the stock binary, or worse if it works by default and I broke it with some shell customization or other...). Three: there are various nifty-looking GUI toolkits, including  urlLink PyObjC  (more than a GUI kit of course) and  urlLink wxPython . Four: consider creating a .term file that launches the Python interpreter directly, like  urlLink this one  which I keep in ~/Library/Application Support/Terminal/ and open via LaunchBar (change /sw/bin/python to /usr/bin/python if you're using Apple's build).    urlLink Discuss

       Some questions I have for Apple.

 
 In Tiger, will the maximum size of a process move past 4GB? Will it move to be 64-bit or 42-bit? 
 When will the L1/L2 cache size on the G5 increase? I'm cool with having to buy an Xserve to get that.  
 Will you please improve the public API for  urlLink NSStatusItem ? There's some stuff I want to DO with that sucker. 
 Will all of Tiger be firmly based on FreeBSD 5.1 or will it be a 4.8/5.0 split like it is now? 
 Somebody noted recently that non-threadsafe libraries from FreeBSD 4.8 are expected to play nice in the threaded XNU kernel. Is this true? 
 When will Apple's  urlLink SOAP support  be updated to conform to the WS-I Basic Profile 1.0? Some of us are using the document/literal form of SOAP and it's really nice. 
 Hey, can I have some better tools for managing my processes? Specifially, I'd like to see Solaris' priocntl and dispadmin ported. I think I can see process scheduling classes when using the  urlLink ThreadViewer , I want more!

        urlLink John Gruber continues to post informative updates  on the security hole situation.   [And he promises that  urlLink this post  will be his definitive one, updated in the future as needed.]  His opinion is that a sufficient fix at the moment is:
 
 Install Apple's "Security update 2004-05-24" (confusingly, this update was actually released on 2004-05-21)
 disable "disk:", "disks:" and "afp:" URI handlers (this does not stop you from, e.g. mounting AppleShare volumes normally)
 set the "ftp:" URI handler to anything except the Finder (e.g., Interarchy)
  
I expect we'll see another fix from Apple within a day or two.

       Update on the security hole:  John Gruber of Daring Fireball has a nice clear post about  urlLink how to disable unsafe URI handlers  using an application which, for reasons he explains well, is better suited to this situation than MisFox or MoreInternet --  urlLink  RCDefaultApp .
 
(By the way, for the curious, Simon Willison has posted a  urlLink sample AppleScript snippet  showing how distressingly simple this exploit is.  Also, if you're interested, read  urlLink Peter da Silva's sage comment  on the architectural reasons this hole exists.)

       Well, this is historic, if bothersome -- looks like OS X finally has a real live "extremely critical" browser-based exploit.  You can read about it via the  urlLink original notice  or in this  urlLink more detailed advisory from Secunia.com . The gist is that an evil cr/\kz0r could place a malicious AppleScript file on your computer via the "disk:" URI handler, then execute it via a hook in the "help:" URI handler. It reportedly has been tested on Safari 1.2.1 and IE 5.2 and is suspected to work on other browsers.  Preventive advice boils down to: "Rename all URI handlers which are not required. Do not surf the Internet as a privileged user."   Update: Never mind that; you just want to fix it? Use  urlLink MoreInternet  or  urlLink MisFox  to make the "help:" protocol launch something other than Help.app.  I used Chess! (I've been advised to alter the "disk:" protocol as well, but that wasn't listed on my machine.)   More info and alternate fix methods to be found at  urlLink Macintouch's Notes and Tips section .
 
Don't believe me?   urlLink Try this exploit demo yourself . (Disclaimer: This was a harmless demo when I tried it, but I cannot be held responsible if it emails the contents of ~/Pictures/Me/Nude/*.* to your entire address book...)
 
It will be interesting to see how this plays out.

       Its been trivial for years to run Windows on a Mac, thanks to Connectix (now Microsoft's)  urlLink Virtual PC . Now Leander Kahney reports that a couple of German comp-sci students have gotten the Mac OS to run in emulation under Windows via their  urlLink PearPC  project:  urlLink OS X Makes Slow Debut on PC 

 
Developed by Sebastian Biallas and Stefan Weyergraf, a pair of 23-year-old computer students from Aachen, Germany, PearPC re-creates in software the PowerPC architecture, the hardware used in Apple's Macs.

The free, open-source software allows Intel- and AMD-based PCs to run several operating systems compatible with the PowerPC, including Mandrake Linux, BSD, Darwin and, most importantly, Apple's Mac OS X.

Users can download and install a copy of PearPC, and then install a boxed copy of OS X, which can be purchased from Apple for $130.

 

Be warned that they're at v0.1 but for the truly adventurous:  urlLink http://pearpc.sourceforge.net/index.html .

I like this convergence of operating systems. Just this very morning I installed Microsoft's  urlLink Remote Desktop Connection Client  to be able to admin some machines at work via my Mac from home (far easier than actually taking the time to pull my PC out from under the desk where it's been serving as a mid-priced footstool for the last three months).

         urlLink   Lets all give a big hello to the newest Atom/RDF/RSS reader on the block,  urlLink PulpFiction 1.0  from  urlLink Freshly Squeezed Software .  It looks like it has a lot of native app goodness.  It should be noted that it is not free or Free, since that seems to be a "hot topic" on the interweb again.  You can try it for 15 days and then go back to something else, or pony up $25 if you like it.
 
 
A feature that jumps out at me right away is how each post is its own entity, and can be moved around, stored, labeled, and even deleted.  I could easily see how this would make some news tracker type people very happy.  It imports and exports OPML, as you might expect.  Of course, the file  must  have a .opml extension and not .xml.  I imported my bloglines subscriptions to get an idea of how it handles what I consider to be a large number of feeds, 109.  To be honest, with over 1,500 unread items it seems a bit sluggish on my trusty 500MHz TiBook.
 
 
Overall, if you are in the market for a new news reader, you should certainly give Pulp Fiction a test drive.

       I never considered  urlLink the GIMP , formidable as it is, to be a very serious competitor to Photoshop, but I just installed version 2.0.1 (via  urlLink DarwinPorts  -- I like DarwinPorts) and am quite impressed with recent progress. In case you missed it like I did, 2.0.0 was released about six weeks ago and 2.0.1 about two weeks ago.
 
This release is a major event, marking the end of a three year development cycle by a group of volunteers and enthusiasts who have made this the most professional release of the GIMP ever. It is the first stable release that is officially supported not only on Unix-based operating systems, but also on Microsoft Windows and Macintosh OS X.
 I posted a cluttered  urlLink screen shot  so you can get a rough sense of the changes. Ironically, I had to leave the GIMP to do the screenshot -- the appealing  File &gt; Acquire &gt; Screen Shot  command just gave me a big black rectangle; a grab to PDF was rendered poorly when imported; and a grab to the clipboard (via cmd-shift-4, ctrl-drag) couldn't be pasted into the GIMP (perhaps Apple's X11 is to blame there, I don't know.) 
In any case, I'm confident those bugs will get fixed. I suspect I won't be buying any more PhotoShop upgrades.

Then this tech note is for you:  urlLink Mac OS X: Mail prints emails backwards and upside down . (I remember a time when something like this could win MacHack - now it's considered a bug. Go figgur.)

       The  urlLink VTBook  is a PCMCIA card that has a 32M video card in it (with dvi output), allowing you to use 2 external displays on a powerbook. I'm using it right now and couldn't be happier. Works on OS 9 and Windows as well.

       OSNews.com correspondent and BeOS enthusiast Nicholas Blachford has posted a nice piece on his  urlLink year with a Mac  (seventeen months, actually, by the dates). Sometimes switchers have a hard time seeing a new platform except in terms of what it lacks relative to their favorite or most familiar OS. Nicholas is quite even-handed, though, and you can't argue with his bottom line: "If you really want to be Windows free, the Mac makes a good choice."

Calhoun is one of those developers who seems publicity-shy yet were you to trace his influences through the history of Mac development you'd probably find them darned near everywhere.

        urlLink Spotlight  seems like a step in the right direction but having to explicitly search for data is so passe! I'd love it if they incorporated  urlLink Dashboard 's automatic display functionality.

       In case anybody missed it, Mac OS X  urlLink Tiger  has been unveiled. Lots of appealling stuff, including:
 
  RSS in Safari (with autodiscovery)
  urlLink Spotlight  searching -- as-you-type results similar to Launchbar or Quicksilver, but with the addition of filtering by metadata (modification date, file type, etc.).
  urlLink Dashboard , a reinvention of Desk Accessories for OS X (which seems to have greatly increased traffic to the  urlLink Konfabulator  site... I liked it better when Apple  bought  the technologies they found worth incorporating, e.g. Stickies)
  urlLink Automator  -- "Like AppleScript, but usable!"
 
The Tiger pitch starts at about the 38:30 mark in the  urlLink webcast stream .
  I have to say, though, it takes some balls to  urlLink mock Microsoft for not being ready with Longhorn  when the release of Tiger could be a year away.

        So...about those GIF files. 

  urlLink ToyViewer , an excellent image tool, has just added the ability to save in GIF format "without any additional setting."  Now I'm going to guess that it has something to do with the patent on lzw compression  urlLink expiring  in Japan on the 20th of June.

       So I've been testing the  urlLink dreaded   urlLink Gmail  for a week or two now. It's pretty good -- especially if you use it in a browser like Firefox that works with Gmail's keyboard shortcuts. It's like a Unix mailer in your web browser, sorta. I use it for high-volume mailing lists.
  
One of my frustrations with Mail.app, which I generally like, has been its lack of keyboard shortcuts for seemingly simple things like proceeding from an open message to the next message in the current mailbox.
 
I am now using a webmail app with better keyboard control than the desktop app it is competing with. Sigh.
 
P.S. I have a few Gmail invites if anybody wants to try it out. E-mail me there: paul.bissex at gmail.com.  Update: All gone!

       Engadget.com has a tutorial on how to " Make your own Pirate Radio Station with an iPod ."  That's a bit of an overstatement; it's more like "how to broadcast to nearby radios using your iPod."

       If you install Microsoft Office 2004 you should restart your machine, even though it doesn't say you have to.  The fonts that were installed with Office did a number on Safari, especially with sites that used Verdana.  Go figure.  Uptime stats are for people who don't install security updates anyway ;-)

       Welcome back, Steve. Welcome back, blog.
 
Question for readers: what is your favorite multiple-clipboard utility? 

  I got addicted to this functionality when using KDE for a couple months last fall. I've looked at a number of the OS X options, and for some reason I've become very fussy. I like the implementation in YouControl, but it comes with a lot of other cruft I don't need.  CopyPaste is, I'm sorry to say, ugly (is it my anti-Windows bias that makes me dislike those over-saturated reds and blues?), which I can overlook in free software but not in payware. Keyboard Maestro Lite is free (always nice), but it is not smoothly integrated enough -- you have to choose between either regular one-step copy/paste functionality or the enhanced type with its intervening dialog and uselessly named clipboards.
 
What I want, most simply, is an invisible clipboard stack.  When I copy or cut, the selection is pushed onto the stack. When I paste, the item at the top of the stack is pasted (and optionally removed from the stack). A simple selection window would allow for more involved tasks, like discarding items or pulling something from mid-stack.
 
What's out there that I've missed?  In what ways can the existing tools be adapted? Could this be hacked up somehow using e.g. Keyboard Maestro invoking shell scripts that use pbcopy and pbpaste?

       One of my frustrations with iTunes is that it's hard to easily navigate between tracks if iTunes is in the background. Some shareware and freeware options have arrived on the scene recently to help solve this.
  
 urlLink SizzlingKeys  is freeware and introduces some global hotkeys and can show a transparent status window when changing tunes.  [via  urlLink Tao of Mac ] 
  
 urlLink Synergy  is shareware that also adds global hotkeys and a transparent window but also adds some items to your menubar for iTunes navigation.  (My girlfriend notes that Synergy was the name of the computer in that old girly cartoon  urlLink 'Jem and the Holograms.' ) 
  
 urlLink MenuTunes  is shareware and provides a transparent status menu and a menubar menu with a dropdown (which doesn't make it any more convenient than the iTunes dock right-click menu, IMO).

       Incessant popping noise: a few days ago the speakers on my 12" Powerbook started making an incessant popping noise that sounds very much like a spike being sent to them, seemingly at random. For a few seconds it'll be fine, then some popping, then silence, then a pop, then... etc.
 
Its making this machine completely unusable since the sound is maddening, akin to being subjected to a constant drip of a faucet. Anyone have any idea what might be causing this new-found issue? Anyone at all?

       By now you have, of course, stopped using IE as your browser right? And you're probably not using Firefox because with Safari who needs anything else? Safari's fantastic.

In one fell swoop  urlLink Chris Pederick  provides a seriously compelling reason to use Firefox: improving your web development experience through his most excellent  urlLink Web Developer plugin . It's hard to explain this thing if you haven't seen it in use but basically it sticks a toolbar into Firefox that gives you total, complete access to everything you'd ever want access to as a web developer.

I can't begin to list the features here, just  urlLink head over  and  urlLink read for yourself . One of those few bits of software that's made me go "wow".
