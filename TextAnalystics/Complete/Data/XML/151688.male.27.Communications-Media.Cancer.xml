      our heads will get fatter as we inflate it with the flatulence that has been so wanting to get out. we, as a collective, whole-heartedly have decided to write about our mission statement. no, it's not a goddamn memo; there's more purpose than that. so here we are discussing semantics and tautology when we should be getting down and dirty. we are all haunted by ghosts that have come and gone. we say "keep it tight, keep it focused." but sometimes, like a silent-but-deadly fart, something just leaks out that was not experienced by the collective. however, i believe if we bring the topic up in the doghouse and we partake -- then it becomes part of the soup. my real question is this: we occasionally do things that are very climatic. it's usually just your run of the mill chit-chat, boozing, and hanging out, so it would seem like there's barely anything to really write about on a day-by-day basic that is blog-worthy in the HDM sense (as opposed to the 13 yr crush-prone girl sense). and if we are precluding those thoughts that were not shared by the mafia, then the topics are severely limited. i believe we have transcended the boundaries of activities buddies long ago and we are telepathically conjoined. sugar keeps it sweet. blue gives it color. and i ..... am an obsessive compulsive rambler.   we like to eat well. some of us like hotdogs; others prefer sausages. we've all tasted cream corn soup. we are HDM.   .... in the news, candlelight bakery is dead and its place candlelight dumplings. shit, i've been going there since 6th grade.

        Keep It Together.  Let's remember to do that.  Just keep it together.     Happy Premise Number One: There are no aliens.    Happy Premise Number Two: There is no giant foot trying to squash me.      -----------------------------------    no, hot dog mafia is not a group of fat italian jews on a corner waiting for their pet pigs to finish their business.      make no bones about it, there is depth and substance to hot dog mafia. just how much? i a cave full of Fraggles, Doozers, Gorgs, Trash Heap, and others.      hot dog mafia is not to be defamed or slandered, its name is not to be tainted. there will be no misinterpretation or misrepresentation. there is no reason for any of this. participants (in every aspect..if you read this, you're an active participant), will add to, enjoy and bask in the warm glow of hot dog mafia. they will take comfort and be consoled by hot dog mafia. they will help right the ship if it is off course. they will help nurture and grow the living breathing presence that is hot dog mafia. challenge but do not deny. engage and contribute to figuring out what is good or bad, right or wrong, tasteful or distasteful, meaningful or meaningless, relevant or irrelevant, smart and clever or stupid and idiotic, funny or bland, interesting or boring...you get the idea. connection with US.   yes, i am unabashedly sentimental. WE are. deal with it b/c we do like cream corn soup.    -----------------------------------    the essence of hot dog mafia?    the element of hot dog mafia?   the essential hot dog mafia?      it is a feeling - a state of mind - it is a band - it is an entity of publishing, of thought leadership, of revolutionary action/inaction - it is THE idea - it is just people - it is a movement - it is a move - it is the culmination of many perspectives...do you see?

      At 9:06am, I had cream corn soup for breakfast.&nbsp; Then at 12:02pm, I had cream corn soup for lunch.&nbsp; Then at 6:04pm, I had......&nbsp; just kidding you standards-upholding-bastards.&nbsp; Granted my much public, self-aggrandizing efforts on my eponymous website, I won't Harvey-Pekar (nor do I really have his talent)&nbsp;this shit to death.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I am more of a volume shooter (like iverson) and perhaps one or two of my ramblings might be interesting.&nbsp;   So while watching&nbsp;Trainspotting,&nbsp;Gerky and I were discussing that watching movies must definitely be a form of escapism and also that, in our memories, we were led to believe that Trainspotting was allegedly a decent movie.&nbsp; So two things come to mind.&nbsp; One, does a person's favorite movies denote what type of person, he/she is?&nbsp; And lastly, if watching movies is&nbsp;escapism and you watch at least two movies (4+ hours) a day, are you a goner?&nbsp; Whatever the case, Netflix is feeding a whole generation of reality runaways.&nbsp; With that said..... Hi my name is Jon and I have 110 movies in my Netflix queue........   While at Goldie's, Blue became Lance (aka Live Strong) because it was revealed that he had a triple layer of desensitizing latex fused to his manhood much like wolverine's adamantium graft (gives him invulnerability).&nbsp; I was thinking about how sometimes I don't perform to the best of my ability because I just stopped caring.&nbsp; I was thinking about pokerface-fucking and typewriter-fucking (if you don't know what that means, then too damn bad) and I was ready to add another one to the list to describe my current state of affairs: time-trial-fucking.&nbsp; Yes, much like Lance's determination to finish the time trial in the Alps ASAP, I found myself doing the same.&nbsp; It's a sad state to be in.&nbsp;&nbsp;The more often&nbsp;you get there, the more your designated hitter just doesn't want to get up to bat because if you have to leg out an inside-the-park homer, then that shit just ain't worth it.&nbsp; Yes yes, you might score and it might even show up on the ESPN highlights because&nbsp;it's a rarity.&nbsp; But you don't want to be known as a dinker, you want to knock the fucking cover off the ball, admire it, fist pump, dance around the bases a bit, do a little stutter step before hopping on home plate, and then double-handedly point to the sky and mutter some sweet nothings.&nbsp; Yeah, I was the man.&nbsp; And that's the way to go...... of course more often than not I find myself echoing the sentiments of the dude in Office Space, "Now, if I work my ass off and Initech ships a few extra units, I don't see another dime. So where's the motivation?"   .... can I get some WTF-you-talking-abouts?&nbsp; in any case, regarding sugar's #2,&nbsp;although I wasn't thrilled by the quality and&nbsp;was not truly able to immerse myself in that pretend-they're-not-only-interested-because-we're-paying-them-money&nbsp;set-up, i am very grateful for the efforts of blue and sugar and also it's something we've never really done together.&nbsp; so even if the girls were annoying and aggressive (not to mention not too hot), we shared some laughs, some drinks, and some good times.&nbsp; amen to that.

       casual chic. this is was the response to my inquiry of a dress code @ Tartare. so i purposefully ignored it. after arriving, i had whispers of regret for not looking pimp, but i decided to focus on the food instead.      definitely got to go back, i'm happy to report that the meal was more than satisfactory and the mills boys track record of fine dining is still riding high. duck fat french fries? tuna foie gras? ostrich tartarte? GENIUS i say. george morrone - kudos to you for making this happen and for showing the community what good eats are about.    ------------------------------------------------------------------    i won't comment extensively on the activities at the gold club...    1) a couple of the strippers really pissed me off. aggresssive bitches who weren't sexy or hot. what's the point of dropping cash on tits and ass that i would kick out of bed. over all, VERY disappointing seeing the low quality of talent at this once esteemed establishment. i guess the gold club has slipped, so the question is - WHERE then, are the hot strippers?     2) found out that prior to last evening's activities, mr.jonmlee had never been the active recipient of a lap dance. wellllll, blue boy and i had to put a stop to that nonsense. so jon got one, i can't say that he was terribly thrilled about it, but at least its over with. besides, remember my point in point #1.    ------------------------------------------------------------------    ok, enough about that.  regarding bwliou's post.      blue boy with blue balls - truely a sad sad story. i wish him well and hope that he maintains his prior level of discipline. is he master of his domain?    ------------------------------------------------------------------      for the purposes of historical context and posterity - let me iterate that we will be thoughtful and insightful with our ramblings, musings, etc. this will be worthwhile content. this does not exist to show the world that we too can join the masses and become certified assholes by thinking that other people give a shit about details of our insignificant lives.      don't get me wrong. YES, we will have many posting that would be categorized as lame. and we will whine and bitch about stupid shit. if you don't like it, don't read it. we won't try too hard to be clever and witty - we'll sprinkle just enough throughout to keep you coming back.       what i'm saying is, the focus of our bullshit won't be boring details of what i had for breakfast, how i slept last night, or how it burns when i pee. you'll get that in healthy doses, but we're smart enough round these parts to mix it up a bit b/c we're the best. that's right, we're the shit. don't forget it.       I'll leave you with this. when you get up in the morning, tell yourself that you're a good person, that you're absolutely good enough, that you like yourslef (even if others don't), and that today is going to be a great day (b/c you are going to make it a great day).

       Preface: On some lonely nights, I throw this one stack of sticky notes (that I never use because it's too high to write anything on it legibly) on my pillow. It's sole purpose for its entire stickied life is to hold one specific message. It reads in big, capital letters: "DO NOT RUB ONE OUT!"    Sunday. July 25, 2004. 6:45a.m.  Mornings after a last night like last night shouldn't be painful. Sebaceous face caked with oil, I awoke with a piercing pang that I could have either taken as arousing or fucking unpleasant. Something was wrong with my right testicle. As if two small fingers held my ball like a vise, the right nut squeezed in on its own and collapsed. I didn't have to look down to know that my raging horniness carried over from last night and that my prick was rigidly beyond its usual morning form.    I've never had blue balls, and again, I didn't look down to tell, but I'm assuming that's how it would feel. But momentarily, I didn't do what my body gave me a jolting warning sign to do. For the past few weeks, I've kept to a disciplined regimen. I do not ever, no matter what kind of torrid, subconscious sex I had with my coworker, try to fiercely beat it. Not if it's whimpering, not if I have a ten-minute window before I can get ready for work, not if it sheds a tear of semen. Never.    Why you ask? Dude, it keeps me up at night. Self-gratification is great. In the past, I've armed my hand close to my boxers when I tuck myself into bed knowing the night will be a long series of kisses with longing eye contact, cameraman point-of-views of my cock ramming some bitch's wet slit and arching necks of flowing hair. Dreaming itself is tiresome. Imagine instinctively beating off while in la-la land. It's no wonder I've been falling asleep on 280 during the morning commute.    But last night - man last night was fun. Granted, the ladies at Gold Club had more squarish jawlines than Tom, Jon and I combined, it was the tease that got to me. It was the hand holding, the lap sitting, the whispers and soft kisses on the ear. One even told me to yank her hair to demonstrate a typical move of mine and then proceeded to lecture me about the long memory of women who have been verbally abused.... TO BE CONTINUED.     http://www.wetcookie.com/pornnewcomer/090704/index.html

      He's found and he's in Japan.&nbsp; It's old news now, but I was thinking back when I first started playing chess and Phil was bringing out the whooping stick on me.&nbsp; I was also thinking back when Charles first started playing.&nbsp; So much has happened since then and time sure moves quickly around here.&nbsp; It'll be nice to be known as the World Champion of something.

       People DON'T BE FOOLED,    Allright, I don't know who this guy is, but I certainly didn't sign on for this shit. So he invited me as a "team member," so what. If he thinks he can just hog up all the space on this blog, he's in for a big ole' lickin. There's too many blogs, not enough world wide web and I'm taking mine, even if it just means taking up this ENTIRE BLOG FOR MYSELF! We're losing internet realty here, so I'm posing as a bloggin groupie and backpacking on this "Tommy" fella. He's all about me, me, me. I'm about me, me, me too.  Sure, we're buds - we're sharing the same blog aren't we? But I see the direction he's taking with his half of the blog. Like Tommy's "sugarboy" blog, each blog, if filtered into a ven diagram, all fit in the middle somewhere to self-promote. A self-promotion of their lives, either through discussion of what happened in a daily e-diary or through a collection of jpegs of moments capturing their daily lives.        What I feel is lacking in many of these blogs is ambition. Though any blog story is great in its own right, it doesn't do much. There are no answers given, and as a matter of fact, no questions raised. Enhancement of the mind is the ideal goal of the average blog, but really it’s just become a scrapbook.        I want to change that. Though there is no departure from a chronicling of “me,” I want to record a new awakening of my mind. A diary of the mind. I somehow regret all that alcohol I’ve thrown down in the past 27 years of my life. Anyway, I want to condense the senses somewhat. Compress the ears, eyes, mouth and fingers for a second and give live mental static. Squish the daily experiences and the pulp to extract some juice. I hope to give snippets of what my mind is doing from day to day, either through snapshots of what I’ve read or perhaps something I’ve dug around to read. What these things do to me and how these experiences educate me, if they do at all, might be solely entertaining, but then again, they might ultimately show that blogs serve no one but oneself. Hopefully they won’t.     B.W. Liou, out.         P.S. This mission statement will be in constant flux as the focus becomes clearer.

      in an effort to increase our vocabulary, here is something for you to chew on. i stole this one from my free subscription to stuff mag.  Main Entry: pri·a·pism Pronunciation: 'prI-&-"piz-&amp;mFunction: noun: an abnormal, more or less persistent, and often painful erection of the penis; especially : one caused by disease rather than sexual desire  Pri·a·pus /prI-'A-p&amp;s/, Greek mythological character. A god of gardens and fertility, Priapus was the son of Aphrodite, who disowned him because he had a grotesque little body with a huge penis. He was a member of the retinue of the god Dionysus and chased after nymphs.  other interesting finds:  urlLink http://www.air-2.com/  Since the dawn of time, humans have burned plants, inhaling unhealthy compounds from the burning that aren't found in the original plant. The Vapir™ line of vaporizers and vaporization products from Air-2 changes all that, releasing an herb's essential material without many of the toxic elements created by smoking. Imagine a smoker who uses a vaporizer with tobacco instead of smoking it. No visible tar, little or no carbon monoxide. Vaporization yields only the pure flavor and active substance of the tobacco without the carcinogenic byproducts.

      in an age of virtual voyeurism, spyware and google-stalking, the dawn of the internet stalker has come to pass. we welcome it with open arms because we are curious and inquisitive creatures by nature. therefore, i would like to share with you the wealth of information at your disposal. for example, useless and pointless information can be found online including how much money your neighbors contributed ( urlLink http://www.fundrace.org/neighbors.php ) to a political fund, as well as your friends, coworkers and family. if you've graduated beyond the rank and file of your typical web monkey into the upper echelon of a cyber psycho, then you can start looking up the corresponding name of a phone number ( urlLink http://www.anywho.com/rl.html ) or an IP address ( urlLink http://www.whois.sc/169.229.15.35 ). i guess this could work wonders if a certain girl gives you her home number / email and you doubt its veracity. the only safeguard against google-stalking is being altogether common ( urlLink http://technology.nzoom.com/cda/printable/1,1856,175193,00.html ). i guess having a non-unique first name and last name should ensure me of having cyber obscurity. then again, I am not really a person who strikes up too much curiosity.

       Dear reader,  West Millbrae won't be an arbitrary Sunday bbq forever. That's been plain to see. After good talks with Chuck and Tom, it's clear - as soon as each of us are of purpose, crossing the chasm of laziness and self-pity, each will travel a road inevitably leading us out of this "city." Not with a spit and scournful look over the shoulder, but with a tunnel-vision yet clear aim walking our legs. It's like the smooth rally of consecutive grounders between Jon, Matt, Jethro, Chuck, Tom, any of us - it will feel effortless and right.  And I will celebrate when that moment comes, though not without a furrowed brow and touch of sadness. Even now, the few of us who've laid out a plan long ago have moved on. Ryan, Phil, BLeong, soon Jethro. But the great thing about us "Mills Boys" is that we won't forget. How can we forget? This is, and always will be, a great clan.  One simple measure of how unique we as a group are, have been the various comments I hear from fringe friends, coworkers and acquaintances. I remember recounting a full day of basketball, tri-tip, DVDs and beer to Theresa when we first started dating. The first thing out of her mouth was, "Wow, you spent the entire day with them?" Pausing, I reacted with 1. surprise: Days like that are natural, every-weekend occurences for us; AND 2. pride: Yes, what are typical Sundays for us are rare to others and yes, we had ten full hours of absolute fun. I made a sound between a harrumph and a laugh and retorted, "You've never hung out with your friends all day long?" She answered with a long "noooooo." Tom has told me his coworkers react similarly in shock.  Thus, we are both the envied and the oddities. We throw footballs in the street for hours, we cook a baby's weight in crawfish, we appreciate scotch and bourbon like old men, we puff cigars and tote on psychedelic pipes, we bob our heads and snap our fingers at places like Biscuits &amp; Blues. BUT, we do throw basketballs and tennis balls at each other's heads, we rip on each other, we punch our meaty fists at each other's clavicles, we give a good slap on the back and then promptly stick our middle fingers up with a loud "FUCK YOU" to each other. There is nothing we won't do.  Look, I'm not sure whom I'm writing this to, and I don't pretend to think our group is more exceptional than the next, but I'm just encapsulating what this group means to me up to this point in my life. And at the age of 27, I'm hitting "two roads diverged in a yellow wood" as are the rest of my brethren. I just hope change will be good to all of us, and whether we traverse the bridge with goals tucked in our arms or find stability not too far away, I hope we never forget all the fun we've had in West Millbrae.  As Tom says,   "we rock."  BLiou.
