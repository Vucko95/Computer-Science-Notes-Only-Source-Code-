      Finally got around to doing a blog.  (Yippee !) Got motivated to doing it after seeing a policy-related blog this morning before a job interview and visiting a lot of network sites this evening:  urlLink Ryze ,  urlLink Tribe ,  urlLink Craig's List , and the other usual suspects.  I'm still too busy to research all of them out there.  One of these days I'll get to visit every site listed at  urlLink Social Software .  But by then something new will take over.....

      Sure, I don't (b)log anything for a month and then I choose to change all of my settings, my layout and the functionality of the blog.  Hmmmm...let's see if this "blog by e-mail" functionality works.  (and if embedded links are as easy as they should be...)  OTN (Obligatory Technology Note):    *Web Hosting* - As someone owns a few domains, who doesn't want to pay a lot for hosting, and who wants CF hosting, I recommend   urlLink HostingDataCenter  .  (Get a reseller account !)  If you want to know more about the hosting field in general (e.g. experiences, tech issues, etc.) see  urlLink WebHostingTalk .

      Joe here again.....(almost a month later !).  Here's some links I want to use to show you some of the work I've done:  My  urlLink Home Page    CSU's  urlLink IR Home Page   An  urlLink article  showing some of the characteristics of the CSU Cohort group (first-time, full time, degree-seeking freshman students)  A redesign of UA's IT Master's Program  urlLink web site   A  urlLink web site  for the BT50K, a 50K fun run that I founded ten years ago

      Returned from the  urlLink AIR Conference  in Boston this week.  Presented my  urlLink demonstration  of Q Methodology and was able to attend quite a few other interesting sessions on retention, swirl, survey techniques and other IR topics.  (The day after returning another Continental flight from Cleveland to Boston received a military escort due to a mistaken transmission made by the pilot.)  Also had a chance to run and roam around the  urlLink Harvard  and  urlLink MIT  campuses and got to see the  urlLink Stata  building at MIT, designed by Frank Gehry.  Much larger in scope and size than the  urlLink Peter B. Lewis building  he designed for  urlLink Case .

      From the too much time on my hands department......  Today I re-activated my  urlLink Yahoo Mail  account after reading about their service upgrade providing free access to a mailbox capable of storing 100 MB of messages.  This is, of course is in response to Google whose  urlLink Gmail  software was also recently launced.  GMail, OTOH, offers 1 GB of storage.  (Little did I know my Yahoo account was deactivated because (probably) of inactivity.)    I think I'm going to do a little experiment and see how fast the spam fills up in each of the boxes which were essentially created on the same day.  (Of course the Yahoo mailbox is older but I rarely gave the address to anyone.)  This experiment will measure the quality of each services spam-prevention software and compare the messages that get through to each.  Perhaps not a very scientific study - especially since I'm publicizing it here - but maybe there will be something of interest that arises.

      The times....they've already changed.  As I was deciding what to enter here tonight - what great pearls of wisdom, new techie finds, or random babblings - I was thinking about how much communication has changed on the Internet.    Earlier this year a  urlLink mailing list about ultramarathons  that I stated with a fellow runner had its tenth anniversary.  Ten years on the same software ( urlLink LISTSERV ) and same host ( urlLink Dartmouth College .)  The school may have upgraded their computers during this time, but the hosts still don't crack the 1Ghz processor speed.    At that time the argument for discussion platforms was mailing lists (LISTSERV, Majordomo, eventually Lyris) vs. newsgroups.  While newsgroups (especially Usenet - though  urlLink Google Groups  is certainly a great tool for researching newsgroups) seemed to have quieted a bit over the years, mailing lists are still strong and have gained competition in recent years from web forums.  Blogs and easy to use software like  urlLink Contribute  allow anyone - yes, anyone - to publish on the web.    Definitely easier accessibility.  Definitely more noise.

      With an e-mail I received earlier today from  urlLink EBay  I was reminded that the used good site they own,  urlLink Half.com , will be integrated into the parent site.  (This will happen in October according to the note/press release.  See this  urlLink note .) As someone who purchases almost everything related to entertainment (books, music, DVD's) online I hope that the convenience (and cheap prices) will not go away. (This  urlLink older article  reminds us of how long it's been since the merger first started.)  Tonight I (re-)experienced this convenience firsthand.  After misplacing a textbook (an older edition of a computer networking book) that I'm using for one of my classes, I decided to order a replacement copy.  (The book is important and I've already been looking for the book for a couple days.  My certainty in ever locating it is dwindling.)  Looking at  urlLink Barnes and Noble , which I usually use for new purchases I was shocked at the price for a new book of $115. (This shouldn't be a surprise for a textbook.)  I then chose to look at EBay.  They had several copies for $5-$10 (and a Buy It Now one for $25 or $35.)  I went to Half.com and found one for under $5 which I reserved and will hopefully get by early next week.  While their main site certainly offers some great deals, here's hoping that EBay chooses to incorporate the Half.com inventory into their own EBay Store feature (or their new "Half-Off" feature, as they call it)and allow customers to still get access to such a wide selection of products, often at dirt cheap prices compared to the big retailers like BN.

      While traditional colleges and universities have also had competition from community colleges and junior colleges, the growth of proprietary schools today in both online and offline forms has been substantial.  The  urlLink guide to proprietary schools  from the University of Virginia offers a good overview to proprietary schools in both of these forms of alternative education.  In today's world, the medium can offer a lot in terms of convenience to the non-traditional student seeking to extend his or her education.

      Found a new set of web tools that I'll be using on some sites I'm working on.  urlLink Bravenet.com  seems to feature a lot of stuff that can be embedded in your own pages and also services (often free) for hosting other features.  Add a customizable e-mail contact page (for example) rather than planting a harvestable e-mail URL, put audio clips on your site, download some scripts, etc.

      As the summer gets into full swing, I've decided to make a serious attempt to get (back) into decent running shape.   At the end of the month, the  urlLink BT50K , will take place in Brecksville, OH.  (Look for the blue blazes.)    This is the 11th running and the first as an actual "race".  I was the rd for the first ten years and it was more of a low key run.  Now, Vince and Steve from The  urlLink Vertical Runner  and Steve Godale have taken over, gotten permits from Cleveland Metroparks and the Cuyahoga Valley National Park and promise to take this run to the next level....whatever that is.  This represents a full relinquishing of my race directing responsibilities having handed over management of the  urlLink Mohican 100  last year.  I hope to start a new ultra race or two in the next couple of years.  Somewhere scenic and probably hilly.  Anyways, as I said earlier I also hope to get my own running career back on track, now that my classes at UAkron are just about done and I'm starting to get the idea that I may have some free time in the fall which I can use for training, racing, etc.  While I've been running marathons and 50K's for the last few years, they've been slow and I hope to both increase my distances and lower my times....

      This entry will be an all-Google post.....  After experiencing  urlLink Orkut  for a couple weeks it seems to be the most comprehensive social site yet in terms of content and users.  There are communities on virtually (no pun intended) every topic.  However, with the ability for anyone to start their own community, there often exist duplicate groups with little differentiation.  While the freedom afforded this capability is nice, as a user with a limited amount of time and desire to select which community(ies) to join the selection process can prove frustrating.  Which one(s) do I join ?  The process of Orkut invitations seems to work well to reduce the amount of noise and eliminate spam.  (I'm not sure how spammers are dealt with - e.g. subscription revoked, posts removed, etc. - but the content seems pure.)  Of course I bought my invitation off of EBay for a couple dollars, but that's beside the point.      urlLink GMail  is another nice product/service.   I've had my account for about 3 weeks now and not a single spam.  Even though I haven't given my address out much, I know that it's easy - though not from experience - for spammers to just append common user names to the popular domain names.  I figured that I would have received at least a couple spams by now.  But I guess that whatever Google is not on the anti-spam side seems to be working.  The content-based advertising is another interesting "feature" and I wonder how long it will be until people find a way to circumvent the service by coding messages to trigger certain ads to display.

      Attended the  urlLink ISTE/NECC Conference  last week with my wife Lynne who did a presentation on  urlLink Virtual Field Trips .  First time to the French Quarter and  urlLink Bourbon St.   The music and action don't stop (and the beads don't stop falling from the balconies above) except for the early (late?) morning hours.   (But the music seems to only be either Zydeco or bad 80's top 40.)  Never been to such a hot and humid place.  (Though Cleveland has its occasional times.)  No wonder everybody moves so slow and no wonder the smell (presumably of wet garbage, not of the bodies in the above-ground cemetaries) permeates the air there.

      For those who are in the job market and want to search online, the first step is usually to go to one of the big general sites like  urlLink Monster  or  urlLink HotJobs  (owned by Yahoo!) or one of the industry-specific sites like  urlLink Dice  (IT) or  urlLink HigherEdJobs  (....uh, higher education).  Of course, these sites work if the employer posts their openings to these national sites.    If you are looking for local postings try instead a site like  urlLink FlipDog  (now owned by Monster) which aggregates and indexes company job listings on their own web site.    Or try  urlLink Craig's List  which offers postings within in each city that the site serves.  For those who want to search multiple CraigList sites, you can download and install these  urlLink PHP scripts  and load them on your own server.  (The result will be something like  urlLink this .)

      Yesterday, after fetching a couple sacks of bird seed at the local Sears Hardware I happily wandered into the the nearby Starbucks to get a iced frappucino   on the balmy Saturday.  I had an extended wait. The baristas forgot/misplaced my order and I watched the 5 people in back of me get their drinks first.  Seated near the day's newspapers I stumbled across a recent business book (The 80/20 Individual) with a sticker on it saying "I'm Free".     After reading the sticker and the enclosed bookmark, I learned the book was  urlLink registered  at  urlLink bookcrossing , a site that facilitates the exchange of books by having members leave their books with the approporiate identifiable markings (the stickers and bookmarks) allowing the finders (me, in this case) to go online, register as a subscriber and tell the system that I have the book.  The idea is for people to freely get rid of books they don't want by leaving them at places like Starbucks.  What's the business model ?  Well, I guess the finders get satisfaction from finding books that might interest them without paying for them (sounds like a library, just potentially more exciting) and bookcrossing gets revenue from people who want to "release" their books by buying supplies (stickers, etc.).    Their site also allows you to do a scavenger hunt, of sorts.  You can look for what books are possibly available in your area and where.   Let's see if they're around in a year or two.  Was the barista's error just fate that allowed me to discover this new service ?  I don't know, but they did give me a coupon for a free drink at my next visit because of the inconvenience.  (And, no, I didn't complain to anyone to get the coupon.)

      While watching my daughters today at the local playground, I read the newest issue of  urlLink Syllabus , a magazine about the use of technology in higher education .  Besides good articles on learning objects and LMS's (Learning Management Systems), there was an  urlLink opinion piece  on the last page about the author's proposed new online course development tool called "Course Creation Systems" (CCS).    As my  urlLink last entry  points out something needs to be done to make online courses easier to create and more functional for the user/student.  An an "expert system" for instructors (haven't heard that term for a while) a CCS would automate the mundane tasks and help add better organization and content to an online course.  Let's see if this idea ever takes off....

      Finally had a chance to roam a little around MIT's new open source course management software,  urlLink Caddie.Net .  (You can login to a demo site at the home page or one of several test site  urlLink here .)  The software looks to improve upon current education LMS software (such as  urlLink WebCT  and  urlLink BlackBoard ) by using web services and a platform based on learning objects.  Rather that creating completely isolated courses without flexibility and connectivity, Caddie.Net allows you to use content from other courses or allow content from your course to be used by other courses.  Information about the benefits of Caddie.Net (and web services, in general) are located in this urlLink Word file .  The software

      If you have read any tech news source lately (last few days) you probably noticed that Google recently purchased  urlLink Picasa  , a program for organizing graphics on your own PC.   I noticed it, explored and installed it (it's free) when I wanted to upload a picture for my last blog entry. Blogger gave me the option of downloading and installing Picasa and since it's free....   Of course, Google with all of its recent offerings and purchases (Orkut......GMail......Blogger......Picasa....???) is reminiscent of Microsoft a few years back trying to blanket the desktop software market. Only now with Google it's the Internet application market. Same users, different paradigm.   Follow all of the Google news (good and bad)  urlLink here .

      Earlier today I had a conversation with a fellow blogger who asked about getting images included in his blog. While I've just been uploading the ones I've used to my own web site, there are other options for those who do not have a web site with file space.  If you are using  urlLink Blogspot  to create your blog (as many/most do), you are given an option of using Bloggerbot. However, clicking on the link generated the error message in the above posting. Instead, try this  urlLink URL  and you should get to the right place:    urlLink http://www.hello.com/how_bloggerbot_works.php    Using the link immediately above you can download the software and, in conjunction with with Picasa or Windows Explorer (not sure what Mac users do), you will have a method for transferring pictures to the web. (Bloggerbot offers free image hosting.) Unfortunately I wasn't able to get it working so smoothly on my first try (my last post) or in this post. (Otherwise I would be able to include the error picture within this message.)  I will obviously need to research this a little more.

      Another online resource similar to that in my  urlLink post from July 23 ...  If you're interested in government and social policies from a research point-of-view, the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Washington D.C.-based volunteer organization, has a great site called  urlLink Both Sides  which, as the name implies, presents both sides of issues (e.g. environmentalism, federal spending, unions, etc.). The materials are culled from published articles, interviews and press releases.

      Yippee !!!  I finally did it !  I made it into the top 1% of all  urlLink SETI At Home  users.  (SETI At Home is a project that uses the computer downtime of PC's to analyze data obtained from telescopes at the University of California at Berkeley.  The project currently has over 5,000,000 users and was one of the first major applications of distributed computing using the general public.  Users automatically download data and upload the analyzed results.)   It took me quite a long time (as you can see on the graphic), but there are simple strategies for making the processing efficient.   1. Use  urlLink Easy SETI  which runs the processing in the background, rather than the screen wasting display of the regular  urlLink SETI program .  (I had some unit cycles that were 100+ hours long, and now I regularly have 6-8 hour cycles.)  2. Run the program as "low priority" so that it doesn't grind your machine(s) to a halt for other applications.   3. Run the program on all of your computers, especially the fast ones.   (Big surprise.)  4. Increase the queue in EasySETI.  The Berkeley site that is regularly down so if you're done processing a unit you're not at their mercy to get new data for processing.

      Time for another Google-related post.&nbsp; To see a visual representation of a URL and its related sites (meaning  similar  -&nbsp;using the Google search term "related:" ), look at the  urlLink TouchGraph Google Browser .&nbsp; Enter a URL and see what other sites and pages are connected.  I'm not exactly sure how the results are derived.&nbsp;&nbsp; When entering my own  urlLink home page , one of the highest related sites is a  urlLink Swedish entertainment site &nbsp;.&nbsp; Strange.
