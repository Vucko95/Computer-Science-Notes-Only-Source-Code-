       Billy Zane  and Jaoquin Phoenix are half-brothers.  Their father may or may not be  the  Lazarus (he could just be  a  Lazarus- type ), this mystical paternity has granted them the ability to raise the recently deceased from the dead.    Do they have a mission?  Yes, to find out the fate of their father and, if he still lives, kill him and set him free from the bonds of the Earth because for every year the Dad is alive, a single soul must take his place in the afterlife.  A soul that would have otherwise continued to live.  Oh, the angst!  Are the brothers raising the right people from the dead? Or are they making things worse?  Would they be better off doing nothing, or not bringing people back and just killing Dad?  How do they find all of this out?  Does a little man who lives in a cave and wears a white robe with an equally white beard tell them?  No!  Their mothers belonged to a cult - both died in childbirth, of course - and they were raised by a woman who amounts to the cult's den mother (because even cults need someone to clean the bathrooms).    Is there a conflict between the brothers? Of course!  Jaoquin's character is afraid of what will be revealed and would rather turn back than continue on and Billy's character drags him forward by sheer inertia.    But who will play Dad?  That is the question.

      Earleir today, as my brother Nathan was getting ready to head home  after visiting for my birthday, we got talking about network television  and how the networks have cancelled some of the shows that we found to  be most promising.  This conversation was inspired by my purchase  of the  urlLink FREAKS AND GEEKS  and  urlLink FIREFLY   boxed sets, and how we felt that the creators of these shows had  learned and not learned the lesson of working in TV,  respectively.  Sort of like Chris Carter with  urlLink MILLENNIUM  and  urlLink HARSH REALM .        But what has all of this got to do with Billy Zane?      Well, Nathan said, "I liked that show.  [HARSH REALM] had that guy from  urlLink THE CUTTING EDGE  - I like him."   " urlLink D.B. Sweeney ," I said, "I'd like to see him in a show with  Billy Zane ."      And thus the concept was born.      Billy and D.B. would play an  urlLink ODD COUPLE -ish  pair of detectives.  Billy would be the "by the book" immacualtely  clean one, and D.B. would be the rough around the edges, "whatever it  takes" one with lackluster hygeine.  Together, they solve crimes -  let's say they are a private investigation firm that specializes in  finding kidnap victims and missing persons.  Billy's character was  a cop, but disgusted and frustrated by what he views a corrupt and  ineffective police force, he leaves and goes into business on his  own.  D.B.'s character is a slightly reformed criminal - a bookie,  who, after having to chase down one too many late payments, had decided  that his connections could be put to a more profitable and less  annoying enterprise.  When we meet them, they've been working  together for some time already, so the rhythm of their relationship is  already established - that way we get to allude previous unseen  adventures and characters that are already established in this universe.      Is it trite?  Is it a cliche'?  Yes and yes.  But the  casting of Billy Zane is what lifts it up beyond the mundane.   Billy and D.B. , we think, would have the chemistry to pull it off and  make it fresh and fun.      Have at it, Billy.  Have at it.

      Billy Zane is, without a doubt, in possession of the most expressive  brow and sparkly eyes known to filmdom.  But that's not the reason  why he's the subject of this blog.  Over the years, it just seems  that his name comes up whenever my brother, Nathan, and I talk about  various concepts for TV shows and movies we'd like to see.      I suppose that this would an approriate place to cite an example - but  that what the other entries are for.  Or I could talk about his  performace in a film that I particularly enjoyed - but that's the  point, I like all of them (with the exception of TITANIC, haven't seen  it)  because  he's Billy Zane.  Although I will say that he totally creeped me out in DEAD CALM.      I'd like to inaugurate this blog by saying one thing: Thank you, Billy.  Thank you.
