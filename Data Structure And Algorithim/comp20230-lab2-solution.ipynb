    "As example of the use of linear recursion, we consider the problem of raising a number $x$ to an arbitrary nonnegative integer, $n$. That is, we wish to compute the power function, defined as $power(x,n) = xn$. (We use the name “power” for this discussion, to differentiate from the built-in Python function _pow_ that provides such functionality.) We will consider two different recursive formulations for the problem that lead to algorithms with very different performance.\n",

    "To analyze the running time of the revised algorithm, we observe that the exponent in each recursive call of function power(x,n) is at most half of the preceding exponent. As we saw with the analysis of binary search, the number of times that we can divide $n$ in half before getting to one or less is $\\mathcal{O}(log n)$. Therefore, our new formulation of the power function results in $\\mathcal{O}(logn)$ recursive calls. Each individual activation of the function uses $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ operations (excluding the recursive calls), and so the total number of operations for computing power(x,n) is O(logn). This is a significant improvement over the original $\\mathcal{O}(n)$-time algorithm.\n",

    "File system traversal is a classic example of using recursion to navigate a data structure (the file system). We will look at an example of finding the total file size of the current directory and any sub-directories. Remember that directories can be nested arbitrarily deeply within other directories and you can have 0 or more sub-directories in a directory. Python allows us to use the **os** module to write code that will execute on any OS.  Run it on your machine and compare it to other students running a diffent OS at your table."
