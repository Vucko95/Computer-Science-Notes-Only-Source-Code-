# DATA SCIENCE IN PYTHON (COMP41680)
The key objectives of this module are 1) to provide students with an initial crash course in Python programming; 2) to familiarise students with a range of key topics in the emerging field of Data Science through the medium of Python. Students will start by exploring methods for collecting, storing, filtering, and analysing datasets. From there, the module will introduce core concepts from numerical computing, statistics, and machine learning, and demonstrate how these can be applied in practice using popular open source packages and tools. Additional topics that will be covered include data visualisation and working with textual data. This module has a strong practical programming focus and students will be expected to complete two detailed coursework assignments, each involving implementing a Python solution to a data analytics task. COMP41680 requires a reasonable level of prior programming experience (but not necessarily in Python).

## What will I learn?
On completion of this module, students will be able to: 1) Program competently using Python and be familiar with a range of Python packages for data science; 2) Collect, pre-process and filter datasets; 3) Apply and evaluate machine learning algorithms in Python; 4) Visualise and interpret the results of data analysis procedures.
