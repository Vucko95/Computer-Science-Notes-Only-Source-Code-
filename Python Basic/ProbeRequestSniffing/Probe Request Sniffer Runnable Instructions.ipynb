    "It is possibleto do the sniffing piece through Python code using the **scapy** package, but I have found that the easiest way is to do it is to use the Mac book's internal network hardware. You need a network card that supports *monitor mode* and not all routers do - luckily the internal Mac Book network card does. \n",
    "\n",
    "To put the card into monitor mode and start capturing wifi packets you need to right click on the wifi icon with the **alt** key held done. This shows an advanced menu from which you can \"*Open Wireless Diagnostics*\". \n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot 1](./wifiSniffingScreen1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Wireless Diagnostics application has stared the **Window** menu allows you to open up the *Sniffer* application - this does the sniffing!\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot 2](./wifiSniffingScreen2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't know as much about Wifi channels as I should. The sniffer application just uses whichever channel you are connected to. If doing the sniffing through code you can set up channel hopping, or high end sniffers (yikes!) will use multiple network cards to sniff on multiple channel simultaneously. If have found, however, that using whatever channel pops up here gives grand results for demonstrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot 4](./wifiSniffingScreen4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click start and sniffing will begin. You'll notice that the wifi icon changes to show that your hardware is in monitor mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot 4](./wifiSniffingScreen5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I usually leave this run for about 10 minutes and then press stop. It dumps out all of the packets sniffed into a **.wcap** file on your desktop named using a date time stamp, e.g. 2016.03.13_16-53-28-GMT+1.wcap. Watch out, if you leave the sniffer run for too long this file gets very big.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can open this file and look at its contents using Wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org/). To find mobile phones, laptops, tablets etc (any wireless access point) you need to find **Probe Requests** which are a specific type of packet that is part of the 802.11 management protocol. In the the 802.11 a management packet has a type of 0 and a probe request has a subtype of 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python code below opens up the wcap file and processes it to find the probe requests and display them. There are a couple of other neat things you can do. Probe requests include the MAC address for the device. Some manufacturers have blocks of MAC addresses associated with them, so you can match MAC addresses to devices by looking this up. Also, as part of a the probe rewuest protocol some OSs broadcast the names of the networks to which they frequently/recently connect (I am not sure about the exact rules governing this) which we can extract. Due to people doing **wardriving** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving) there are large databases of the locations of wifi networks so you can geolocate these networks and display them on a map - which is a neat trick. Wigle.net (https://wigle.net/) is a service that allows look up of a database of wifi network locations collected by people and is used in the code below."
